0,1968882288,nonverbal learning disability school behavior and dyslexia,1992,nathlie a badian,annals of dyslexia,1,16,34,"The aims of the study were to investigate whether children showing a low nonverbal/high verbal (LNV) WISC-R profile are more likely to exhibit behaviors conducive to school failure than children with a low verbal/high nonverbal (LV) profile, and to examine the relationships among these behaviors, the LNV/LV profiles, and reading ability. The 65 subjects included 27 LNV and 38 LV children, aged 5 to 11 years. Results confirmed earlier findings (Badian 1986) that LNV children are perceived by their teachers as significantly poorer than LV children in many behaviors associated with school success. There was a dichotomy, however, between LNV good and poor readers. All LNV subjects displayed problems in organizational skills, but those who were dyslexic were poorer in social behavior (e.g., acceptance of criticism and peer relationships) than either LNV good readers or LV good or poor readers. It was concluded that children with a low nonverbal/high verbal profile and a probable right hemisphere dysfunction, who appear to be dyslexic in the early school years, are at high risk for both social behavior problems and school failure, and that these children are a more high-risk group than poor readers with a low verbal/high nonverbal profile."

This study explored humor comprehension in children with nonverbal learning disabilities (NVLD). Children with NVLD were compared with children with reading disabilities and a comparison group of children with no learning disabilities to assess their comprehension of humor. The humor test was composed of a joke and cartoon section. No group differences in humor comprehension were found when the NVLD group was defined as having visual–spatial and visual reasoning deficits. However, when the NVLD group was divided into children with and without social perceptual difficulties as defined by a direct measure of social comprehension, significant group differences were found in the levels of humor comprehension. These results support the association of humor comprehension with social perception and lend tentative support to the hypothesis that children with NVLD may not be a homogenous group. Future study directions include further exploration into the nature of the association between humor comprehension and social perception as well as closer examination of the heterogeneity of NVLD."

A self-organizing systems (SOS) paradigm suggests widespread, diffuse outcomes, whereas a specific learning disability concept suggests more localized dysfunction. There may be very good reason to doubt the veridicality of the concept of a specific learning disability, not because the construct of learning disabilities itself is a frivolous concept, as some have held, but because the biological or neurological events that underlie a learning disability do not remain focal and constrained only to specific dysfunction. It is important to know whether an identified learning disability remains contained or whether processing disorders might be found in other areas. The assessment profiles of school-age children identified with nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD), assumed to have primarily right-hemispheric brain dysfunctions, and children with language-based learning disabilities (LLD), assumed to have primarily left-hemispheric brain d..."

Additionally, compensatory mechanisms in children and adults with DD have been located within frontal brain areas. However, it remains unclear when and how differences in posterior left-hemispheric networks manifest and whether compensatory mechanisms have already started to develop in the prereading brain. Here we investigate functional networks during phonological processing in 36 prereading children with a familial risk for DD (n = 18, average age = 66.50 mo) compared with age and IQ-matched controls (n = 18; average age = 65.61 mo). Functional neuroimaging results reveal reduced activation in prereading children with a family-history of DD (FHD+), compared with those without (FHD−), in bilateral occipitotemporal and left temporoparietal brain regions. This finding corresponds to previously identified hypoactivations in left hemispheric posterior brain regions for school-aged children and adults with a diagnosis of DD. Furthermore, left occipitotemporal and temporoparietal brain activity correlates positively with prereading skills in both groups. Our results suggest that differences in neural correlates of phonological processing in individuals with DD are not a result of reading failure, but are present before literacy acquisition starts. Additionally, no hyperactivation in frontal brain regions was observed, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms for reading failure are not yet present. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether the identified differences may serve as neural premarkers for the early identification of children at risk for DD."

The first paper is a systematic review of literature investigating the effectiveness of preschool, classroombased literacy interventions used with children living in economic disadvantage. The review consists of nine studies, the majority of which found significant short term effects of intervention. Two of the studies reported long term outcomes which were found to be non-significant. Consequently, recommendations for further research included exploration of a wider range of factors in raising the literacy levels of children from economic disadvantage. The second paper is a bridging document which explains how the various decisions in this piece of work were made, including the research focus, methodology, method and analysis. Through the bridging document, ontology, epistemology and reflexivity are explored and ethical and quality issues are discussed. The third paper describes and discusses a piece of empirical research. Following on from recommendations in the systematic review, a wide range of factors which may be useful in enhancing the literacy levels of children from economic disadvantage were explored. A participatory model of research was used which involved training six pupils from a school situated in a deprived area to carry out research with their peers. The group produced a collaborative mind map and interviewed five of their peers. Six themes emerged from these methods: resources, strategies, skills, people, enjoyment and practice. The benefits and limitations of using a participatory research model are discussed. The data gathered was deemed to be useful but not necessarily better than that gathered using more traditional non-participatory methods. Implications and suggestions for further research are explored."

This paper reviews evidence for oral language components, shown to have predictive capacity to identify at-risk readers at an early age. Both phonological and non-phonological components of oral language difficulties are linked to poor reading outcomes in a majority of children. At-risk preschoolers may present with phonological deficits, sub-clinical or clinical language impairment. The nature and importantly the trajectory of reading difficulty will vary, depending on the area of language breakdown. Irrespective, difficulty with reading comprehension is likely to result. Importantly, the variation in the trajectory of reading difficulty means that some children may struggle during the initial phases of learning to read, whereas others may experience initial success, but encounter difficulties at a later point when reading demands increase. Clinical implications for speech-language pathology assessment practices and ongoing monitoring of oral language and reading skills are discussed."

Bandura‘s (1993) socio-psychological theory of self efficacy was used to frame this study, which included six ELFA administrators from the state, district, and school level. The five findings of this study revealed the following: (1) high quality job-embedded professional development strengthened teachers’ capacity to achieve a shared purpose; (2) efficacious ELFA leaders believed that they could alter their school culture and increase student achievement, despite having a low performing student population; (3) the gradual elimination of funds detrimentally impacted all levels of governance and created a snowball effect that ultimately decreased student achievement; (4) the urgency to help students read on grade level ignited a willingness for ELFA educators to trust each other; and (5) the standardization of practices resulted in a common language that ELFA leaders used to produce results, ensure compliance, and build teacher capacity. This study revealed that ELFA leaders believed that they could overcome challenges such as having a low performing student population and obstacles such as shortage of funding and low parental involvement. The ELFA leaders’ self efficacy beliefs directly impacted their actions and behaviors as well as those under their supervision."

Despite the high percentage of young students in classrooms using technology, the impact of this technology on the early literacy skills of young children remains largely unknown. Guided by Vygotsky’s social learning theory, this study reports a 24-week investigation on whether regular use of Istation®, an integrated learning system used by approximately 3,000,000 students in the United States, had an effect on the early literacy achievement of children in twelve kindergarten classrooms. A mixed-method, quasi-experimental design was constructed using propensity scores. Also investigated were the effects of the level of teacher literacy support on early literacy achievement and the interaction between Istation® use and the level of teacher literacy support. A descriptive discriminant analysis was performed to determine the main effect of Istation®. The level of teacher support and the interaction effect was then tested using a multivariate between-subject analysis. NA Results indicated that Istation® did have a statistically significant effect on the early literacy skills of the 72 kindergarten students studied and was able to explain 17.7% of the variance in group differences. NA Hearing and recording sounds and letter sound knowledge were the main contributors to group differences. Teacher literacy support and the interaction between teacher support and Istation were not significant.

However, the nature of this relationship remains controversial because verbal STM, like reading acquisition, depends on the complexity of underlying phonological processing skills. This longitudinal study addressed the relation between STM and reading decoding acquisition by distinguishing between STM for item information and STM for order information based on recent studies showing that STM for item information, but not STM for order information, recruits underlying phonological representations. If there is a specific link between STM and reading decoding acquisition, STM for order information should be an independent predictor of reading decoding acquisition. Tasks maximizing STM for serial order or item information, measures of phonological abilities, and reading tests were administered to children followed from kindergarten through first grade. We observed that order STM capacity, but not item STM capacity, predicted independent variance in reading decoding abilities 1 year later. These results highlight the specific role of STM for order in reading decoding acquisition and argue for a causal role of order STM capacity in reading acquisition. Mechanisms relating STM for order information and reading acquisition are discussed."

Six methods of dichotomous risk classification were also explored to predict whether students would pass or fail the state test. A random sample of half of the participants was used to establish locally appropriate risk cut-scores, holding sensitivity constant at .95; the cut-scores were then cross-validated on the remaining participants. Cross-validation reflected sensitivity of above .90 for all methods, with MAP Language Usage and two multi-screener methods demonstrating the strongest overall technical adequacy for risk classification.

In the first part of the study, we recruited 155 elementary first grade students for a screening test. Phonological deletion, digit naming, object naming, and sound-letter correspondence knowledge of a screening test, all assessed at the beginning of the school year, predicted the reading ability at the end of the school year. In the second part of the study, we analyzed the difference in the reading ability between fourteen children who participated in the intervention program and eighteen non-participating children. Reading ability was assessed by evaluating word recognition, oral reading fluency, reading comprehension, and pseudo-word recognition. The reading ability of intervention group improved more compared to control group, and the difference between two groups accentuated over time. However, final analysis conducted in November revealed that two groups did not differ significantly in oral reading fluency. This suggests that, unlike word recognition and comprehension, fluency might not dramatically improve in a short period."

A mixed-method, quasi-experimental design was constructed using propensity scores. Also investigated were the effects of the level of teacher literacy support on early literacy achievement and the interaction between Istation® use and the level of teacher literacy support. A descriptive discriminant analysis was performed to determine the main effect of Istation®. The level of teacher support and the interaction effect was then tested using a multivariate between-subject analysis. Results indicated that Istation® did have a statistically significant effect on the early literacy skills of the kindergarten students studied and could explain 17.7% of the variance in group differences. Teacher literacy support and the interaction between teacher support and Istation® were not significant. This study considers the relationship between technology and early literacy and concludes that Istation® can serve as a more knowledgeable other as students develop some early literacy skills; however, teachers are still needed to provide complete literacy instruction for young students."

Although effective phonological awareness training programs exist, children at risk often do not reach similar levels of phonological awareness after the intervention as children with normally developed skills. Based on theoretical considerations and first promising results the present study explores effects of an early musical training in combination with a conventional phonological training in children with weak phonological awareness skills. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design and measurements across a period of two years, we tested the effects of two interventions: a consecutive combination of a musical and a phonological training and a phonological training alone. The design made it possible to disentangle effects of the musical training alone as well the effects of its combination with the phonological training. The outcome measures of these groups were compared with the control group with multivariate analyses, controlling for a number of background variables. The sample included N = 424 German-speaking children aged 4 to 5 years at the beginning of the study. We found a positive relationship between musical abilities and phonological awareness. Yet, whereas the well-established phonological training produced the expected effects, adding a musical training did not contribute significantly to phonological awareness development. Training effects were partly dependent on the initial level of phonological awareness. Possible reasons for the lack of training effects in the musical part of the combination condition as well as practical implications for early literacy education are discussed."

One hundred and eighty-four Chinese ESL children from eight Hong Kong kindergartens were measured four times during their last year of kindergarten for phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary and English word reading. Growth mixture modeling was applied to classify the children based on their growth trajectories in English word reading. Four subgroups of word reading growth were classified, namely high-achieving, fast-growth, slow-growth and low-achieving groups. The cognitive-linguistic skills were compared across different groups with age, non-verbal intelligence and receptive vocabulary in L1 controlled. The results showed that low-achieving groups, who were expected to be at-risk for L2 reading disability, showed deficits in letter-name knowledge, phonemic awareness, and receptive and expressive vocabulary. Fast-growth and high-achieving groups were not distinguishable on the measured cognitive-linguistic skills. Children in the low-growth groups were significantly weaker in phonemic awareness, receptive vocabulary and expressive vocabulary than children in the high-achieving group. Our findings identified specific cognitive-linguistic deficits that were associated with children who are at-risk for reading disability. Implications for the early identification of L2 reading disability were discussed."

Furthermore, reading difficulties runs in families and children with a family risk of reading difficulties tend to show delays in emergent literacy and might experience a less advantageous home literacy environment. This study examined whether family risk predicts children’s second-grade reading difficulties in a multifactorial model including both emergent literacy and environmental protective factors such as home literacy environment and parental level of education. Children were assessed for emergent literacy at the beginning of first grade, and were identified as having reading difficulties at the end of second grade if they performed below the national threshold in at least three of the subtests in reading and spelling. The multifactorial model suggested that children with family risk showed reading difficulties that could not be explained in terms of individual differences in emergent literacy, gender, interest in literacy, years in kindergarten, home literacy environment or parental education level. These findings highlight the advantages of using multifactorial models of reading difficulties that encompass different domains of genetic, cognitive-based and environmental factors. In sum, not only did we find family risk is associated with children’s literacy outcomes after 2 years of formal reading instruction, but we also identified possible modifiable factors that may benefit from interventions and lessen the likelihood of developing reading difficulties."

However, controversy still surrounds both the identification and man agement of this condition, and while its etiology is recogni zed as being complex and multifactorial, yet little progress has b een made in elucidating predisposing factors at the biological level. The purpose of this review is to explore the possibility of dyslexia that falls within biochemical and cognitive spectru m of disorder. Based on the biochemical evidence, there is a necessity for further research into the role of fatty acids in dev elopmental dyslexia that contributed with an abnormal metabolism of HUFA in fetal brain development, or the maintenance of normal brain function. Currently, the molecular geneticists have been seeking to identify the actual genes underlying developmental dyslexia. Nine loci were found to be associated with susceptibility to dyslexia (DYX1 to DYX9). Those have contained important four candidate genes associated with dyslexia that would aid in distinguishing between children whose reading problems are caused primarily by cognitive deficits with biological origin. Acc ordingly, the cognitive deficits of dyslexia will be present ed in the domains of phonological, auditory processing, visual, magnocellular and automaticity/cerebellar deficit theories. Understanding the biochemical and cognitive basis of dyslexia may help us plan our future research."

In the auditory modality, this deficit has been hypothesized to interfere with accurate speech perception, and subsequently disrupt the development of phonological and later reading and spelling skills. In the visual modality, an analogous problem might interfere with literacy development by affecting orthographic skills. In this prospective longitudinal study, we tested dynamic auditory and visual processing, speech-in-noise perception, phonological ability and orthographic ability in 62 five-year-old preschool children. Predictive relations towards first grade reading and spelling measures were explored and the validity of the global magnocellular model was evaluated using causal path analysis. In particular, we demonstrated that dynamic auditory processing was related to speech perception, which itself was related to phonological awareness. Similarly, dynamic visual processing was related to orthographic ability. Subsequently, phonological awareness, orthographic ability and verbal short-term memory were unique predictors of reading and spelling development."

In a subsample of the participants—those with the highest vocabularies—results were in line with a predicted interactive effect of phonological and lexical characteristics on phoneme awareness performance: word sets contrasting similar sounds were less likely to yield correct responses in words from sparse neighborhoods than words from dense neighborhoods.

Interestingly, children with developmental dyslexia - a learning disability that affects reading acquisition despite normal intelligence and adequate education - have a poor rhythmic perception. It has been suggested that an accurate perception of rhythmical/metrical structure, that requires accurate perception of rise time, may be critical for phonological development and subsequent literacy. This hypothesis is mostly based on results showing a high degree of correlation between phonological awareness and metrical skills, using a very specific metrical task. We present new findings from the analysis of a sample of 48 children with a diagnosis of dyslexia, without comorbidities. These children were assessed with neuropsychological tests, as well as specifically-devised psychoacoustic and musical tasks mostly testing temporal abilities. Associations were tested by multivariate analyses including data mining strategies, correlations and most importantly logistic regressions to understand to what extent the different auditory and musical skills can be a robust predictor of reading and phonological skills. Results show a strong link between several temporal skills and phonological and reading abilities. These findings are discussed in the framework of the neuroscience literature comparing music and language processing, with a particular interest in the links between rhythm processing in music and language."

It is well established that a major cause of these problems lies in poorly specified phonological representations. Many individuals with dyslexia also present impairments in auditory temporal processing and speech perception, but it remains debated whether these more basic perceptual impairments play a role in causing the reading problem. Longitudinal studies may help clarifying this issue by assessing preschool children before they receive reading instruction and by following them up through literacy development. The current longitudinal study shows impairments in auditory frequency modulation (FM) detection, speech perception and phonological awareness in kindergarten and in grade 1 in children who receive a dyslexia diagnosis in grade 3. FM sensitivity and speech-in-noise perception in kindergarten uniquely contribute to growth in reading ability, even after controlling for letter knowledge and phonological awareness. These findings indicate that impairments in auditory processing and speech perception are not merely an epiphenomenon of reading failure. Although no specific directional relations were observed between auditory processing, speech perception and phonological awareness, the highly significant concurrent and predictive correlations between all these variables suggest a reciprocal association and corroborate the evidence for the auditory deficit theory of dyslexia."

Regression analysis indicated that together the four comparison measures accounted for 36% of variance in overall EDI scores, each making a significant and unique contribution. Results supported the convergent validity of overall EDI scores but not the discriminant validity of EDI domain scores. Moreover, correlations between EDI scores and comparison measures varied widely across teachers, suggesting considerable individual differences in teacher’s ability to evaluate school readiness relative to direct, child-based assessments, and confirming that the EDI is more appropriate for deriving inferences at higher aggregated levels such as community or region.

The way in which discoveries in molecular genetics are reported can be misleading, encouraging us to think that there are specific genes that might be used to screen for disorder. However, dyslexia is not a classic Mendelian disorder that is caused by a mutation in a single gene. Rather, like many other common disorders, it appears to involve combined effects of many genes and environmental factors, each of which has a small influence, possibly supplemented by rare variants that have larger effects but apply to only a minority of cases. Furthermore, to see clearer relationships between genotype and phenotype, we may need to move beyond the clinical category of dyslexia to look at underlying cognitive deficits that may be implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders."

Practice on motor skills results in facilitation in treatment progress of children with phonological disorders. The purpose of this study was to compare motor skills in 5-year-old children with phonological and phonetic disorders. Methods: Thirty-two children age 5 years, 16 with phonemical speech sound disorders and 16 with difficulty at a phonetic level participated in this study. TOLD Test was performed for linguistic skills investigation among children. Phonetic test, Wepman test, diadochokinesis and oral assessment was used for diagnosis between phonological and phonetic disorders. The children were also evaluated with Oseretsky motor developmental scale . Results: In comparison, mean scores of movement skills between both groups showed significant difference (p=0.006) and children with phonetic disorder got significantly higher scores on all part of this test. Conclusions: The findings of this study support the idea that speech sound disorders are frequently associated with motor problems, and that type of articulation disorder affects the motor performance in a different way.

Researchers are beginning to understand the relationship between the accuracy and distinctiveness of stored phonological representations and performance on phonological awareness tasks. However, many of the tasks currently used to assess the integrity of underlying representations are confounded by requiring spoken output. Aims: This paper describes the development of the Quality of Phonological Representations (QPR) task, a task that does not require speech output, and its evaluation in the context of a larger study examining predictors of literacy outcomes in Western Australia. Methods & Procedures: The QPR task was given as part of a larger task battery to a cohort of 235 mainstream children in the last term of their Preprimary year (average age55;5) and to 179 children at follow-up at the end of Year 2 (average age57;9). Outcomes & Results: Normative data for both accuracy and reaction time are presented in percentile tables (appendix B). In their Preprimary year, children were able to identify correct productions of multi-syllabic words (hits) on average 87.5% of the time, rising to an average of 93.8% in Year 2. As expected, children became quicker at making these judgements, reaction time shifting from an average of 1.1 s in Preprimary to 0.83 s in Year 2. A similar pattern was observed with the data for correct rejections. To make these judgements, the children had to identify a pseudo-word as an incorrect pronunciation by ‘Katie the computer’. In the Preprimary year, children were able to reject correctly the pseudo-words on average 68.5% of the time, rising to an average of 81.7% in Year 2.

This study explored whether students’ performance on a simple rhythm task at school entry could serve as a predictor of whether they would face difficulties in word reading and spelling at the end of grade 1. The participants were 479 Norwegian 6-year-old first graders randomized as controls in the longitudinal RCT on track (n = 1171). Rhythmic timing and pre-reading skills were tested individually at school entry on a digital tablet. On the rhythm task, the students were told to tap a drum appearing on the screen to two different rhythms (2 Hz paced and 1.5 Hz paced). Children’s responses were recorded as they tapped on the screen with their index finger. Significant group differences were found in rhythm tapping ability measured at school entry, when groups were defined upon whether children went on to score above or below the 20th percentile reading and spelling thresholds in national assessment tests at the end of grade one. Inclusion of the school-entry rhythmic tapping measure into a model of classification accuracy for above or below threshold reading and spelling improved accuracy of classification by 6.2 and 9.2% respectively."
1,2781873955,dyslexia as a multi deficit disorder working memory and auditory temporal processing,2018,"leah fostick, hadas revah",acta psychologica,1,4,102,"Abstract NA NA Dyslexia is difficulty in acquiring reading skills despite adequate intelligence and sufficient reading opportunities. Its origin is still under debate. Studies usually focus on a singular cause for dyslexia; however, some researchers argue that dyslexia reflects multiple deficits. Two of the abilities under investigation in dyslexia are working memory (WM) and auditory temporal processing (ATP). In order to better evaluate the relative roles of WM and ATP in dyslexia, in the present study, we tested the contribution of WM and ATP to different types of reading performance and phonological awareness in dyslexia, using a multidimensional approach. Seventy-eight adults with dyslexia and 23 normal-reading adults performed WM and ATP tasks, as well as reading and phonological awareness tests. Readers with dyslexia showed poorer performance on all tests. Both WM and ATP were significant predictors of reading performance and phonological awareness among participants with dyslexia. Dividing participants with dyslexia according to their performance level on WM and ATP tasks revealed group differences in reading and phonological awareness tests. Both WM and ATP contribute to dyslexia, and varying levels of difficulties in both of these abilities are observed among this population. This is strong evidence in favor of the multi-deficit approach in dyslexia, and suggests that researchers should consider this approach in future studies of dyslexia."
1,2889978424,memory patterns in children with reading disabilities with and without auditory processing disorders,2007,julie ann ellis,NA,0,1,127,"Researchers in the fields of audiology and education debate the role of auditory processing disorders (APD) in the development of several other language based learning disabilities such as dyslexia. Despite the controversies, certain neurological, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics are apparent among children diagnosed with APD, several of which are shared with the dyslexic population. The current study attempted to illuminate one such characteristic ? deficiencies in verbal memory skills. Forty children with moderate to severe reading disabilities, half of whom had a co-morbid diagnosis of APD, between the ages of 7 and 12 years, and twenty normally achieving children matched for gender and age participated in this study. Consistent with previous research, results indicated significantly lower scores on verbal memory tasks among children with reading disabilities. However, whether a diagnosis of APD obtained by behavioral measures was significantly related to more profound verbal memory deficits among children with reading disabilities could not be clearly established. Children with comorbid RD and APD displayed significantly lower IQ scores and significantly lower levels of reading achievement than their reading disabled counterparts without APD diagnoses. These findings help to illuminate the nature of a possible link between APD and more profound reading disabilities and cognitive deficits and may have important implications for educational practice and intervention for these children.

The instructions given to students of pre-school education (4 and 5 years old) and first grade of primary school (6 years old), were evaluated in writing with standardized test three years later. The experimental group obtained higher scores than the control group in the phonological and rapid naming tasks. And more interesting, the experimental group obtained better results in writing tasks. These results have important theoretical implications, as they show the relationship between phonological awareness and naming speed in learning to write.

Some studies examining the relationship between reading acquisition and verbal STM for order and item information separately in beginning readers have found that order STM capacity is independently predictive of nonword decoding abilities in first grade, but item STM is not. In this longitudinal study, we first aimed to explore whether this finding also holds for nonword spelling abilities. We also sought to determine whether order STM capacity remains an independent predictor of nonword decoding and spelling abilities in the second year of reading instruction. For this purpose, 70 typically developing children were followed over 3 years, from kindergarten to second grade. In kindergarten, children were administered order and item STM tasks and phonological awareness tasks, in addition to tasks assessing letter name knowledge, vocabulary knowledge, and nonverbal reasoning. In first and second grades, the children’s word and nonword reading and spelling abilities were assessed. The results revealed that order STM capacity was a robust independent predictor of nonword reading and spelling abilities in first and second grade, but was not related to the abilities to read and spell words. The specific role of order STM in the acquisition of the sublexical reading and spelling routes is discussed."

Four year old children attended the program for three years; five year olds received instruction for two years while six year olds received instruction for one year. They all were evaluated when they were finishing the first year of Primary education. Results showed that training relates with greater improvements in the experimental group compared to the control group especially in phonological awareness. Intervention relates to improvements in reading speed of words in the three participant age groups. These results have educational implications as they give information that facilitates the process of learning to read through the teacher work in the classroom and it also helps to prevent learning disabilities."

In a sample of 127 children, these cognitive preconditions were assessed before the onset of formal education, whereas reading as well as spelling achievement was measured at the end of grade 1. The findings indicate that working memory does contribute to the prediction of early reading and spelling, and that this contribution outperforms that of general intelligence and phonological recoding from long-term memory during the early steps of reading and spelling acquisition. Moreover, the results show that phonological awareness mediates the effects of working memory capacities on early literacy outcomes. The role of working memory and phonological awareness as key cognitive preconditions of early reading and spelling are discussed."

These children are at risk for phonological awareness (PA) deficits. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate phonological awareness in Persian-speaking children with phonological disorders. Patients and Methods: Thirty-six children with PD aged 5 - 6 years were selected by a convenience sampling method during 12 months. Children with PD were divided into three groups according to their error patterns. Fourteen normally developing (ND) children were selected as the control group. In order to equalize socioeconomic status, ND children were similar to the PD groups based on age, residential area, and mothers’ educational attainments. Language, speech sound production, oro-motor, and PA skills were investigated. Intra-syllabic and phonological awareness (PA) were compared to investigate PA skills in the four groups. Relation between percent consonant correct (PCC) and PA was also investigated in the four groups. Fourteen children with phonological delay, 12 children with consistent atypical phonological disorders (CAP), and 10 children with inconsistent phonological disorders (ICP) formed the PD groups. Results: The CAP group showed significant difference with the ND group in alliteration (P = 0.001), rhyme (P = 0.001), identification of words with the same initial phoneme (P = 0.002), and identification of words with the same final phoneme (P = 0.001) [except blending phonemes (P = 0.504)]. Though performing more poorly, the delayed group did not show significant difference with ND group (P > 0.05). The ICP and ND groups did not show significant difference in PA except in identifying words with the same final phoneme (P = 0.008). The relation between PCC and PA was observed only in the CAP group (P = 0.021). Conclusions: The results suggested that PA skills in children with phonological disorders are affected by error type. We also found the type of errors that can play a more effective role in PA investigations as compared to PCC. The results also showed that children with CAP require special attention."

METHODS: we analyzed early reading skills in 73 children aged between six and eight years, from a public school in Sao Paulo. The instrument used for assessing the children's early reading skills comprised of 20 subtests involving the following skills: ""Oral language""; ""Phonological processing""; ""Comprehension""; ""Reading and writing""; and ""Print awareness"". Data were collected and analyzed by school year (1st and 2nd grades) in order to identify differences in development at the early stages of Reading acquisition. RESULTS: it was found that the performance of some 1st- and 2nd-graders was less than average when compared to the remainder of their group on the skills considered as predictors of literacy. This low performance was identified from the percentage of total correct responses in the assessment Instrument and the classification into percentiles. There were no differences between the two grades in terms of ""Oral Language"" and ""Print awareness"". What differentiated one group from the other was their outcome at ""Reading and writing"" and ""Phonological processing"" tasks, with 2nd-grade students performing better on the following tasks: (a) word reading; (b) pseudoword reading; (c) word spelling; (d) pseudoword spelling; (e) rhyme production; and (f) reading comprehension. CONCLUSION: schooling influenced the performance on phonological processing abilities, and on reading and writing skills. Phonological processing abilities and print awareness correlated with the decoding involved in the writing and reading of isolated items."

Findings demonstrated that preschool children's math self-concept can be separated into competence and affect components, with the competence component displaying higher relations to early math achievement than the affect component. The competence component but not the affect component was found to be related to prior math achievement, providing evidence of the skill-development model of self-concept–achievement relations in preschool years. Boys and girls demonstrated similar self-concept–achievement relations and mean levels in the competence and affect components of math self-concept. Given so far little research on self-concept in preschool children, this study offers important insights and expands current knowledge."

The study included 105 children (54 girls) from 12 preschools in Norway. The preschools were randomly assigned to the experimental group with the invented writing program, or the control group with the ordinary program offered to preschoolers. The classroom-based programs (40 sessions) were conducted by the children’s regular teachers. The children’s emergent literacy skills were evaluated using a pre-test, a post-test and a follow-up test 6 months later, and the data were analyzed using latent autoregressive models. The results showed that the invented writing group performed significantly better than the control group on the post-test for the measures of phoneme awareness (d = .54), spelling (d = .65) and word reading (d = .36). Additionally, indirect effects were observed on the delayed follow-up tests on phoneme awareness (d = .45), spelling (d = .48) and word reading (d = .26). In conclusion, we argue that invented writing appeared to smooth the progress of emergent literacy skills in preschool, including the subsequent reading development in school. Contextualized in a semi-consistent orthography and a preschool tradition that does not encourage the learning of written language skills, the findings add to our knowledge of how children learn to write and read."

Two experiments were conducted for this purpose. In Experiment 1, normal readers (N = 108) and dyslexics (23) were given a set of literacy tasks, visual attention, and rapid automatized naming. The results indicated that dyslexic children exhibited lower reading-related skills than controls. Visual attention and phonological processing were able to predict word reading. Experiment 2 was carried out on 36 dyslexic children compared to chronological-age controls. This experiment was designed to assess the relation between phonological awareness and working memory with word recognition and reading comprehension. Results showed significant differences between groups in literacy scores. In addition, inter-correlations indicated a strong relation between word recognition and reading comprehension on one hand and phonological awareness and verbal working memory on the other. Regression analyses showed that rapid naming, visual attention, and verbal working memory were significantly associated with literacy. The findings underscored the importance of cognitive skills in the acquisition of Arabic literacy and emphasized persistent difficulties in dyslexic children from multiple causes."

The main objective of the study was to examine what predicts word reading fluency at two crucial points during Grade 1: mid-year, before a multi-tiered intervention, and again 12 weeks later at the end of the year, after the intervention. A total of 47 first graders in Israel were assessed on cognitive and literacy tasks before and after an implementation of intervention. Our preliminary results demonstrate that in Hebrew orthography, there is a rapid growth in word reading fluency during Grade 1. One skill, syllable deletion, predicts reading fluency by the middle of Grade 1. By the end of Grade 1, two skills predict word reading fluency: RAN and syllable deletion. The results call attention to the pedagogical need to monitor this skill in Hebrew and emphasize the need to include fluency theoretically in models of reading as well as in related practice of early reading development in Hebrew orthography."

The STPM was assessed using a standardized test of Pseudoword Repetition. PA was assessed through a Sequential Assessment Test (CONFIAS). Results: No difference was found between the students of 1st and 5th years in STPM both in total score and concerning the similarity of the pseudowords. Regarding PA, there was a significant difference among the percentage distribution of correct answers in syllabic and phonemic tasks, and the students from 5th grade presented better performance. Conclusion: At the beginning and at the end of the elementary school, there is no difference in STPM performance. On the other hand, there is difference in PA, which highlights the influence of schooling on PA development. The correlation between STPM and PA only in 5th-year students suggests that, at the beginning of literacy, STPM cannot be considered as a predictor to children's performance in PA. Nevertheless, as the schooling advances, there is influence of PA on STPM."

The analysis was conducted on a large and representative sample using path models. The results revealed that, together with the consistent contribution of PA and orthography, morphology played an important role in predicting spelling. Furthermore, our findings suggested that Arabic orthography, even the vowelised version which is considered as transparent (since it provides the reader with the full phonological information), behaved as other deep orthographies in spelling. These findings are discussed in the context of the unique characteristics of the Arabic language and its orthographic system."

To examine potential differences, we studied reading processes on different proficiency and complexity levels. Specifically, we used data from the standardization sample of the German reading comprehension test ELFE II (n = 2,807), which assesses reading at word, sentence, and text level with separate speeded subtests. Children from grades 1 to 6 completed either a test version on paper or via computer under time constraints. In general, children in the screen condition worked faster but at the expense of accuracy. This difference was more pronounced for younger children and at the word level. Based on our results, we suggest that remedial education and interventions for younger children using computer-based approaches should likewise foster speed and accuracy in a balanced way."
1,2614576140,evaluation of klassekist super spellen a dutch method of spelling,2017,m j boshuizen,NA,0,0,21,"Dutch language instruction and Mathematics are core subjects in the Netherlands. An important part that is taught during Dutch language instruction is spelling. Spelling is the way words are written and includes all the official rules for written language (Kennisplatform voor het onderwijs, 2016). As a result of the literature research of Nijhof (2006) about effective instruction for spelling for a primary school in the Netherlands, the method “Klassekist Super Spellen” is developed for Dutch spelling instruction. Because Klassekist is in practice for seven years now in the fourth grade in the Netherlands and is in practice at approximately 50 primary schools, the question was raised by the developer of Klassekist how well the method works. Therefore, the following research questions were formulated for this study: “To what extent are the aspects of effective spelling instruction and the interim objectives of the fourth grade, that are formulated by the SLO, met by the method?” and “To what extent are the potentially different scores on the Cito test of the fourth grade dependent on the method of spelling that is used?” A literature review of effective spelling instruction has been conducted, in which the results are compared with Klassekist. A checklist with the interim objectives that are formulated by the SLO and the Cito scores of 355 students from their third grade (year of 2014-2015) and their fourth grade (year of 2015-2016) are used. The literature review showed that Klassekist contains many aspects of effective spelling instruction. The checklist revealed that the major interim objectives are treated within Klassekist. Results of the scores from the Cito student monitoring system did not show a significant effect of Klassekist. Recommendations for practice and for further research are discussed."

Students responded by keyboard with accurate recordings of response-onset latency (RT) and inter-keypress interval (IKI). We determined effects of a number of child-level cognitive ability factors, and of word-level factors—particularly the location within the word of a spelling challenge (e.g., letter doubling), if present. Spelling accuracy was predicted by word reading (word split) performance, non-word spelling accuracy, keyboard key-finding speed and short-term memory span. Word reading performance predicted accuracy just for words with spelling challenges. For correctly spelled words, RT was predicted by non-word spelling response time and by speed on a key-finding task, and mean IKI by non-verbal cognitive ability, word reading, non-word spelling response time, and key-finding speed. Compared to words with no challenge, mean IKI was shorter for words with an initial challenge and longer for words with a mid-word challenge. These findings suggest that spelling is not fully planned when typing commences, a hypothesis that is confirmed by the fact that IKI immediately before within word challenges were reliably longer than elsewhere within the same word. Taken together our findings imply that routine classroom spelling tests better capture student competence if they focus not only on accuracy but also on production time course."

The aim of the study was to examine whether the connection between phonemic awareness and literacy in Greek is constant over time even when appropriate controls are taken into account. I examined this hypothesis with Greek Cypriot children (N = 404) ages 6 to 10. Results showed that after an interval of 8 months and even after I controlled for the estimation of verbal ability and morphological awareness, phonemic awareness predicted children’s performance in reading. Phonemic awareness predicted spelling only after I controlled for the estimation of verbal ability. In terms of the need to establish more general theories about phonemic awareness and literacy, this study contributes the long-term relation between phonemic awareness and literacy in Greek. In practice, this study contributes valid measures for assessing phonemic and morphological awareness in Greek."

Little is known about how this is achieved by children who grow up speaking a dialect. The present study examined literacy-related skills before school in 71 children (meanage: 7.61y) with a differing degree of exposure to Swiss-German (SwissG) dialect and tested their reading and spelling skills at the end of Grade 1. No differences in Grade 1 reading and spelling were found between groups of children with different SwissG exposure. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) revealed that SwissG exposure was negatively associated with Grade 1 spelling and reading, when statistically controlling for early literacy-related-skills. At the same time, SwissG exposure was positively associated with early literacy-related skills that drive reading and spelling development. Thus, literacy acquisition in children speaking a dialect is characterised by disadvantages due to a linguistic mismatch, but also by compensatory advantages o..."

A recently developed assessment battery for young readers of SI was used to test the feasibility of Pennington et al.’s (2012) multiple-case approach to dyslexia in the highly transparent orthography of SI. Reading, spelling, phonological skills, and nonverbal IQ were assessed in 285 first, second, and third graders. Deficits in reading-related cognitive skills were classified and regression analyses were conducted to test the fit of single and multiple deficit models. Naming speed (NS) was the main predictor of reading and decoding fluency, followed by phonological awareness (PA), and verbal working memory (VWM). Accounting for 33% of the cases that satisfied both methods of individual prediction (i.e., classification of deficits and regression analysis), the hybrid model proved the best fit. None of the deficits in PA, NS, or VWM alone was sufficient to predict a risk of dyslexia in the present sample, nor was a deficit in PA necessary. Hence, there are multiple pathways to being at risk of dyslexia in SI, some involving single deficits, some multiple deficits, and some without deficits in PA, NS, or VWM."

The results showed that, on average, children achieved low scores on tests of word writing; however, the within-group variations in the children’s invented writing performances were large. The statistical modeling showed that parental education was significantly related to the home literacy environment, which was, in turn, directly related to both vocabulary and phonological awareness and indirectly related to invented writing skills.

Our data consist of eye-movements collected while 124 young English speaking adults of variable reading skill read passages and performed six modifications of RAN. These modifications isolated articulatory, lexical, oculomotor and attentional task components of RAN. A further requirement for participants was to perform each of the RAN tasks in two directions—the habitual direction of reading (RAN forward) and from right to left and top to bottom (RAN backward). Participants who were better at oculomotor control in RAN-like tasks were better readers regardless of task type or direction. Our most crucial finding is that the explanatory contribution of oculomotor control in the RAN-reading relationship is independent of the practice effect afforded by the habitual direction of visual scanning in reading."

Path analyses revealed that a universal model could not be confirmed. When we specified the best-fitting model separately for each language, RAN was a consistent predictor of reading fluency in all orthographies, whereas the association between PA and reading was complex and mostly interactive. We conclude that RAN taps into a language-universal cognitive mechanism that is involved in reading alphabetic orthographies (independent of complexity), whereas the PA–reading relationship depends on many factors like task characteristics, develop..."

Deficits in RAN have been repeatedly observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and also among first-degree relatives, suggesting that RAN may tap features that index genetic liability to ASD. This study used eye tracking to examine neurocognitive mechanisms related to RAN performance in ASD and first-degree relatives, and investigated links to broader language and clinical-behavioral features. Fifty-one individuals with ASD, biological parents of individuals with ASD (n = 133), and respective control groups (n = 45 ASD controls; 58 parent controls) completed RAN on an eye tracker. Variables included naming time, frequency of errors, and measures of eye movement during RAN (eye-voice span, number of fixations and refixations). Both the ASD and parent-ASD groups showed slower naming times, more errors, and atypical eye-movement patterns (e.g., increased fixations and refixations), relative to controls, with differences persisting after accounting for spousal resemblance. RAN ability and associated eye movement patterns were correlated with increased social-communicative impairment and increased repetitive behaviors in ASD. Longer RAN times and greater refixations in the parent-ASD group were driven by the subgroup who showed clinical-behavioral features of the broad autism phenotype (BAP). Finally, parent-child dyad correlations revealed associations between naming time and refixations in parents with the BAP and increased repetitive behaviors in their child with ASD. Differences in RAN performance and associated eye movement patterns detected in ASD and in parents, and links to broader social-communicative abilities, clinical features, and parent-child associations, suggest that RAN-related abilities might constitute genetically meaningful neurocognitive markers that can help bridge connections between underlying biology and ASD symptomatology."

Research on verbal fluency in dyslexia has shown impaired performance in semantic and letter fluency. However, studies report inconsistent results, and action fluency has not been examined in dyslexia. Current research has mainly examined verbal fluency in relation to executive functions, vocabulary, and phonological processing. The present study examined performance on letter, semantic, and action fluency in relation to reading ability in 42 students in higher education, of which 16 had developmental dyslexia and 26 had typical reading development. It was examined if verbal fluency can predict variance in reading ability when group, phonological awareness, and rapid automatized naming are controlled for. Results showed impaired verbal fluency in the developmental dyslexia group. Action fluency and group were significant predictors of reading ability, together explaining 73% of the variance, in a backward elimination regression analysis. The results point to a possible, unique connection between action fluency and reading ability; this connection is discussed based on their neurocognitive underpinnings."

These notions are elaborated to show that differences in reading acquisition reflect fundamental differences in the nature of the phonological recoding and reading strategies developing in response to the specific orthography to be learned. The present paper provides a narrative, cross-linguistic and integrated literature review, thereby contributing to the development of universal reading models and at the same time pointing out the important differences between orthographies at the more detailed level. Our review also yields suggestions to devise language-specific instruction and interventions for the development of the specific reading strategies required by the characteristics of the orthography being acquired."

Arguably, the contributions of these skills differ for words opposed to pseudowords and for targets that can be spelled on the basis of phoneme-to-grapheme conversion (phonologically consistent) and those that cannot (phonologically inconsistent, relying on orthographic knowledge). We assessed these issues in early spelling. A total of 83 first graders and 58 second graders completed word and pseudoword dictation tasks, containing phonologically consistent and inconsistent items. They also completed tasks reflecting potential cognitive correlates of spelling: phoneme awareness, rapid automatized naming, visual attention span and word reading. Dictation outcomes demonstrated that more spelling errors were made in inconsistent than in consistent items. The effect of lexicality differed across grades: More errors were made in spelling words than pseudowords in Grade 1, whereas the opposite pattern was found in Grade 2. Phoneme awareness and rapid naming, but not visual attention span, were found to be significant correlates of spelling outcomes. However, the cognitive correlates captured only a limited amount of variance in spelling errors. Moreover, these effects mostly disappeared once word reading was entered as a predictor. These findings indicate that research into predictors of spelling should distinguish between words and pseudowords, consistent and inconsistent items, and should consider more spelling-based rather than reading-based correlates of spelling performance."

We test the hypothesis that phonological skills explain the relationship between speech and reading difficulties. Speech skills were assessed in a large ( N  = 569) unselected sample of 5-year old children just after school entry. Children also completed a wide range of tasks measuring oral language (expressive vocabulary, receptive grammar and listening comprehension), reading and reading-related skills (single word reading, letter-sound knowledge, phoneme awareness, rapid automatized naming) and non-verbal IQ. Assessments were repeated six months later. Speech difficulties were identified in 6.88% of children. Speech difficulties were associated with poorer non-verbal IQ, oral language and reading relative to children without speech difficulties. A mediation model demonstrated that the relationship between speech difficulties and later reading was entirely mediated by phoneme awareness. Speech difficulties at school entry are related to problems in acquiring phoneme awareness which in turn are associated with problems in learning to read. Clinically, our results imply that any child who has a speech difficulty at school entry should be assessed and monitored for broader oral language difficulties and for delays in reading development with a view to providing early intervention to ameliorate such difficulties."

Latent variable path models showed that pattern understanding predicted significant additional variance in both reading and arithmetic after controlling for a range of other variables.

However, many children around the world encounter problems learning to read, fail to develop fluent decoding, and are thus diagnosed as dyslexic. A large body of research supports the conclusion that a phonological deficit underlies most developmental dyslexia. Much of the existing evidence, however, is based on studies of children learning to read in English. It is important to note that English has an opaque orthography that creates challenges beyond those facing children who read more transparent orthographies. In recent years, the research base for developmental dyslexia has broadened across languages, allowing the question of differences and similarities across languages and writing systems to receive attention."

Using data from a large study involving 502 children and adolescents (332 diagnosed with ADHD, 145 diagnosed with anxiety disorder, and 126 diagnosed with neither), ages 7 to 15 years, this paper applies structural equation modeling to test the sequential relationship between the latent constructs of attention, working memory, and academic achievement, and the effects of symptoms of ADHD and anxiety on each construct, and also to assess consistency in measurement techniques of each underlying construct. The study establishes that the structural equation model created to replicate a theory of automaticity fit the data from this sample well, and there was significant sequential prediction between attention, working memory, and academic achievement. In addition, better performance on measures of attention and working memory predicts higher academic achievement, as relative weaknesses in academic achievement seen in children and adolescents with ADHD can be explained largely by deficits in attention and working memory. Anxiety symptoms were unrelated to attention, working memory, and academic achievement, when controlling for ADHD. However, a significant negative correlation between harm avoidance, a trait of anxiety, and ADHD symptoms suggest that it may be of value to explore the theoretical underpinnings of the relationship between harm avoidance, ADHD, and academic achievement."

1,34916195,supporting children s language and literacy skills the effectiveness of shared book reading intervention strategies with parents,2012,soh hong sim,NA,0,2,215,"Parents are encouraged to read with their children from an early age because shared book reading helps children to develop their language and early literacy skills. A pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) research design was adopted to investigate the influence of two forms of a shared reading intervention (Dialogic Reading and Dialogic Reading with the addition of Print Referencing) on children’s language and literacy skills. Dialogic reading is a validated shared reading intervention that has been shown to improve children’s oral language skills prior to formal schooling (Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). Print referencing is another form of shared reading intervention that has the potential to have effects on children’s print knowledge as they begin school (Justice & Ezell, 2002). However, training parents to use print referencing strategies at home has not been researched extensively although research findings indicate its effectiveness when used by teachers in the early years of school.

Eighty parents of Preparatory year children from three Catholic schools in low income areas in the outer suburbs of a metropolitan city were trained to deliver specific shared reading strategies in an eight-week home intervention. Parents read eight books to their children across the period of the intervention. Each book was requested to be read at least three times a week. There were 42 boys and 38 girls ranging in age from 4.92 years to 6.25 years (M=5.53, SD=0.33) in the sample. The families were randomly assigned to three groups: Dialogic Reading (DR); Dialogic Reading with the addition of Print Referencing (DR + PR); and a Control group. Six measures were used to assess children’s language skills at pre and post, and follow-up (three months after the intervention). These measures assessed oral language (receptive and expressive vocabulary), phonological awareness skills (rhyme, word completion), alphabet knowledge, and concepts about print.

Results of the intervention showed that there were significant differences from pre to post between the two intervention groups and the control group on three measures: expressive vocabulary, rhyme, and concepts about print. The shared reading strategies delivered by parents of the dialogic reading, and dialogic reading with the addition of print referencing, showed promising results to develop children’s oral language skills in terms of expressive vocabulary and rhyme, as well as understanding of the concepts about print. At follow-up, when the children entered Year 1, the two intervention groups (DR and DR + PR) group had significantly maintained their knowledge of concepts about prints when compared with the control group. Overall, the findings from this intervention study did not show that dialogic reading with the addition of print referencing had stronger effects on children’s early literacy skills than dialogic reading alone. 

The research also explored if pre-existing family factors impacted on the outcomes of the intervention from pre to post. The relationships between maternal education and home reading practices prior to intervention and child outcomes at post were considered. However, there were no significant effects of maternal education and home literacy activities on child outcomes at post. Additionally, there were no significant effects for the level of compliance of parents with the intervention program in terms of regular weekly reading to children during the intervention period on child outcomes at post. These non-significant findings are attributed to the lack of variability in the recruited sample. Parents participating in the intervention had high levels of education, although they were recruited from schools in low socio-economic areas; parents were already highly engaged in home literacy activities at recruitment; and the parents were highly compliant in reading regularly to their child during the intervention. 

Findings of the current study did show that training in shared reading strategies enhanced children’s early language and literacy skills. Both dialogic reading and dialogic reading with the addition of print referencing improved children’s expressive vocabulary, rhyme, and concepts about print at post intervention. Further research is needed to identify how, and if, print referencing strategies used by parents at home can be effective over and above the use of dialogic reading strategies. In this research, limitations of sample size and the nature of the intervention to use print referencing strategies at home may have restricted the opportunities for this research study to find more effects on children’s emergent literacy skills or for the effectiveness of combining dialogic reading with print referencing strategies. However, these results did indicate that there was value in teaching parents to implement shared reading strategies at home in order to improve early literacy skills as children begin formal schooling."

The assessments currently used for these purposes, such as Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM; Deno, 1986) and the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS; Good & Kaminski, 2002) can be time-consuming to administer to large groups of students. The present studies describe the initial evaluation of innovative, group-based progress monitoring measures. In Study 1, the three experimental measures (Reading Fluency, Maze Sentences, and Dolch Word Recognition) were administered to 73 first grade students four times during the academic year and the measuresA¢â‚¬â„¢ reliability, validity, and ability to demonstrate studentsA¢â‚¬â„¢ growth over time were compared to those of two criterion measures, Word Identification Fluency (WIF; Fuchs, Fuchs, & Compton, 2004) and DIBELS Oral Reading Fluency (ORF). In Study 2, Reading Fluency, Maze Sentences, WIF, and ORF were administered weekly to four first grade students who were at risk for reading failure. In the multiple baseline design, the students received an intensive phonics intervention while their progress was monitored with the experimental and criterion measures. Results provide evidence that the Reading Fluency and Maze Sentences tasks are as reliable and valid as other measures in current use for screening, but suggest that they are not sensitive to studentsA¢â‚¬â„¢ growth over time. Of the experimental and criterion measures, WIF was the only measure to demonstrate adequate ability to model studentsA¢â‚¬â„¢ growth. Thus, results suggest that NA 
the Reading Fluency and Maze Sentences tasks are promising benchmark/screening assessments within an RTI framework."

Three hundred and fifty one students were tested in Grades 1-6. There were two main purposes that motivated this longitudinal and cross-sectional study. The first goal was to compare the Ll and L2 language and literacy performances of the immersion students to a comparable group of children who attended the same school and were taking English as a core subject. The second purpose was to investigate which variables successfully predicted L2 English word identification and reading comprehension for the combined group of students. After pretest scores were controlled, it was found that the immersion students significantly performed at a higher level than the nonimmersion students on measures of oral language proficiency, vocabulary, phonological awareness, pseudoword decoding, reading identification, and reading comprehension, but there were no significant differences on measures of alphabet recognition, morphological awareness, or written grammar. There were particularly large differences for oral language proficiency and reading comprehension, favoring the immersion students. There were no differences between the groups on Chinese literacy measures, indicating that the program was an additive bilingual system and did not subtract from Ll literacy. The results from the regression analyses showed that literacy precursor variables that help to decode English words such as phonological awareness and pseudoword decoding ability were the best predictors of both word identification and reading comprehension in the early grades. Oral language proficiency and vocabulary became increasingly important in the upper grades, particularly in relation to reading comprehension. The results of the study suggest that instructional methods that emphasize the teaching of sound-symbol correspondences and phonological awareness may be helpful for the students and should be the focus of future experimental research. These study results have the potential to contribute to the debate about the feasibility and effectiveness of early English education in China and the ways that immersion programs change and adapt to meet local educational constraints and needs."
1,122935328,prereading deficits in children in foster care,2011,"katherine c pears, cynthia v heywood, hyoun kyoung kim, philip a fisher",school psychology review,1,34,17,"Children in foster care fare worse than their peers on many indicators of academic adjustment, exhibiting high rates of special education placement, discipline referrals, and school dropout (e.g., Scherr, 2007; Zima et al., 2000). Children in foster care also lag significantly behind their peers in reading, writing, numeracy, and language (Mitic & Rimer, 2002) and perform significantly worse on measures of academic and socioemotional adjustment compared to children from low socioeconomic backgrounds (Pears, Fisher, Bruce, Kim, & Yoerger, in press). This poor performance does not appear to be solely attributable to unique risk factors often found in children in foster care. For example, Fantuzzo and Perlman (2007) found that, even when other risk factors (e.g., birth and poverty risks) were controlled, being in out-of-home care significantly and independently predicted poor academic and behavioral adjustment for children in second grade.

Given the elevated risks for poor school adjustment among children in foster care, there is a need for research on the potential early precursors of school difficulties with this population. Additional knowledge about the reading development of children at risk for academic failure because of foster care placements could expand the scientific knowledge base about academic skill development in general, and could also allow service providers to tailor preventive intervention services to the needs of such populations (Justice, Invernizzi, Geller, Sullivan, & Welsch, 2005). Because child welfare agencies often have limited resources for screening and intervention services for children in foster care (Zima et al., 2000), such targeted interventions could aid agencies in maximizing resources to increase the chances of better school outcomes for these children.

Early reading skills are an important predictor of later academic and behavioral adjustment in the general population. Children who struggle with reading in the first and second grades are likely to exhibit difficulties into middle and high school (e.g., Cunningham & Stanovich, 1998). Poor reading skills have also been linked to behavioral difficulties at school, which may increase the likelihood of problems such as antisocial behavior and juvenile delinquency (Halonen, Aunola, Ahonen, & Nurmi, 2006). In one of the few studies to examine reading skills in school-aged children in foster care, Fantuzzo and Perlman (2007) suggested that children in out-of-home placements show markedly poorer reading skills than their peers as early as second grade. Reading difficulties may already be well-established by the second grade (Al Otaiba & Fuchs, 2006); thus, identifying risk factors for poor reading prior to school entry might help in preventing later problems.

To date, there are no published studies on prereading skills in children in foster care prior to school entry, and research regarding early screening could aid intervention efforts to prevent subsequent difficulties in this population. The prereading skills considered in this study have been linked to later reading abilities in the general population. In kindergarten, phonological awareness (i.e., the ability to distinguish sounds in words) predicts better reading outcomes across the early school years, and alphabetic understanding (i.e., the ability to recognize letters) is linked to well developed or deficit reading skills (National Institute for Literacy, 2009). General language skills also appear to be important to later reading abilities, particularly reading comprehension (e.g., Catts, Fey, Zhang, & Tomblin, 1999). Based on the deficits observed in the later academic functioning of children in foster care (Mitic & Rimer, 2002), we hypothesize that the children in our study would perform more poorly on measures of prereading skills as compared to the general population.


Schatschneider, Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, and Foorman (2004) noted that there was little agreement in the literature on the relative importance of specific prereading skills in predicting later reading abilities. Additionally, different prereading skills may be differentially important for specific populations to outcomes, and could be effective targets for intervention (Al Otaiba & Fuchs, 2006). We can best pinpoint those targets by testing such associations within particular populations such as children in foster care. In this study, we examined associations between prereading skills in children in foster care and teacher-rated early literacy skills in kindergarten, while controlling for the other prereading skills and an estimate of general intelligence. The following research questions guided the study: 


How do the prereading skills of children in foster care compare to those of general population children?


To what extent are particular prereading skills more important than others in predicting teacher-rated early literacy skills in kindergarten for children in foster care?"
1,122970878,the development of phonological awareness by braille users a review of the research,2008,"martin r monson, sandy k bowen",journal of visual impairment & blindness,1,2,19,"Abstract: This article presents a review of research on the development of phonological awareness by braille readers. The review determined that the relationship between phonological awareness and braille is uncertain because of the lack of commonality among the studies, the extent of contradictory findings, and the small number of studies involving beginning braille readers. ********** Much has been written about the relationship between phonological awareness and reading (Laing & Hulme, 1999; Sodoro, Allinder, & Rankin-Erickson, 2002; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987). Phonological awareness, as defined by Anthony and Francis (2005, p. 255), is an individual's ability to determine the sound structure of oral language and is ""strongly related to literacy."" Furthermore, the National Reading Panel (NRP, 2000) reported that instruction in phoneme awareness, a component of phonological awareness, had a significant, causal effect on students' development of reading and spelling. Anthony and Francis stated that phonological awareness and its relation to literacy exists in all alphabetic languages that have been examined. In contrast, Li Hal, Spinks, Eden, Perfetti, and Wai Ting (2005) found that Chinese, a logographic system, exhibits a weak relationship between phonological awareness and reading. The logographic nature of contracted braille may pose a dilemma for students who are blind or have low vision and use braille as their reading medium because braille is a combination of both an alphabetic and logographic system (Millar, 1997). Given the findings of NRP and the potential effects they may have on instruction for all readers, beginning braille readers included, this article examines the relationship between braille and phonological awareness skills by reviewing the current research on the topic. We attempt to answer the questions of the causality of phonological awareness to the development of braille reading skills and whether children who read braille have better or worse phonological awareness skills than do children who read print. Since the publication of NRP's (2000) report, there has been widespread interest in phonemic awareness and phonological awareness. Although an overview of NRP and its findings is outside the scope of this article, a few explanations related to these terms are necessary to clarify the intent of our study. NRP stated that phonemic awareness ""refers to the ability to focus on and manipulate phonemes in spoken words"" (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2000, p. 28). Phonemic awareness is different from phonological awareness in that it ""is a more encompassing term referring to various types of awareness, not only phonological awareness [phonemic awareness] but also awareness of larger spoken units such as syllables and rhyming words"" (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2000, p. 28). To be included in the review presented here, studies must have examined at least one area of phonological awareness, but may have also isolated other components of reading, including phonemic awareness. The topics of phonological awareness and braille are both extensive, and an exhaustive review of the literature on them is beyond the scope of this article. However, a brief explanation of each is necessary to ensure a shared understanding of the findings. Blachman (2000, p. 483) stated that phonological awareness ""is an awareness of ... the segments in speech ... that are more or less represented by an alphabetic orthography."" Goswami (2000) noted that phonological awareness comprises three levels, the syllable, onset and rime, and phoneme, and that they develop in the order listed. Many studies (Blaiklock, 2004; Bus & Van Ijzendoorn, 1999; Schatschneider, Francis, Carlson, Fletcher, & Foorman, 2004) have determined that phonological awareness is a predictor of and necessary for later success in reading. Some of the identified phonological awareness tasks involve tapping the number of syllables or phonemes found in a word; finding the odd word out on the basis of the beginning, middle, or ending sounds of a list of words; or identifying words as the same or different by asking participants to determine if spoken words have a shared sound at the beginning or end of the words (Goswami, 2000). …"

The Persian orthography, unlike English, is written from right to left. It is cursive and most of the letters change their shape when connecting to letters on one or both sides. The orthography also has the feature of using marks to represent sounds within the language. These marks are not always included in written text, particularly when the text is targeted at more experienced readers. Over 200 school-children in Iran from grades 2 to 5 were given measures of text reading comprehension involving Cloze completion or passages followed by questions. Comprehension levels were compared to scores on measures of language competence, phonological ability, orthographic processing and speed of processing. Analyses indicated that Persian reading comprehension levels, consistent with English models of reading, were predicted by measures of linguistic competence and word decoding, with the latter being predicted by phonological and orthographic processing skills. However, orthographic skills and speed of processing showed predictions of Persian reading comprehension independent of word decoding processes, findings that differed to those predicted from the Englishlanguage derived models. These findings were examined among over 150 Persian-English bilingual children in Persian grades 2 to 5 who attending mainstream schools in New Zealand or Australia. These children were being educated in an English medium context, but with Persian as their home language. Analyses of predictors of reading levels verified the findings reported from the monolingual data. In addition, comparisons of good and poor reading comprehenders argued for deficits in"

1,307583642,expanding understanding of emergent literacy empirical support for a new framework,2007,"karen a erickson, deborah d hatton",journal of visual impairment & blindness,1,16,52,"Abstract: Emergent literacy in young children with visual impairments is examined using a conceptual framework proposed by Senechal, LeFevre, Smith-Chant, and Colton (2001). The utility of this framework for young children with visual impairments is illustrated using data from a field study of preschool classes for children with visual impairments. ********** Relatively little is known about the development of language and literacy in children with visual impairments (that is, those who are blind or have low vision). The research that has been conducted suggests that these children are at risk of experiencing delays in the development of language and literacy (Bigelow, 1987; Fraiberg, 1977; Preisler, 1995; Urwin, 1984). From early ages, children who are visually impaired show delays or differences in babbling (Fraiberg, 1977); speaking in one- and two-word combinations (McConachie, 1990; McConachie & Moore, 1994); and in using language (Anderson, Dunlea, & Kekelis, 1984; Bigelow, 1987; Sapp, 2001; Urwin, 1984). Furthermore, differences have been found between children with visual impairments and other children with respect to the frequency of reading storybooks and engaging in other literacy learning experiences (Stratton & Wright, 1991), as well as general opportunities to explore the world (Wormsley & D'Andrea, 1997). It appears that limited incidental learning through pictures, television, print in the environment, or events that occur silently in learning environments (Koenig & Farrenkopf, 1997) influences the language and literacy learning of children who are visually impaired. As interest in understanding emergent literacy for children with visual impairments continues to increase, it seems important to develop or adopt a conceptual framework to guide both research and practice. Starting with a well-defined conceptual model will provide researchers and practitioners with a common language and conceptual understanding from which they can develop a model that will best fit the characteristics of literacy and of language learners who are visually impaired. Whether the field of visual impairment and blindness eventually chooses to adopt a conceptual framework that is developed to explain the development of literacy for sighted children or to create one of its own will depend largely on the fit between these models and the growing evidence base. In this article, we describe a conceptual framework of emergent literacy that was developed for sighted children and provide initial evidence of its applicability to children who are visually impaired using data that were collected in a field study that investigated literacy practices for young children with visual impairments in preschool settings. Emergent literacy The conceptual framework described here was selected because it encompasses a holistic understanding of emergent and early literacy that incorporates all aspects of written and oral language (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkinson, 1985; Clay, 1966, 1979; Teale & Sulzby, 1986). Furthermore, it encompasses the extant definitions of emergent literacy for young children who are visually impaired (D'Andrea & Farrenkopf, 2000; Stratton & Wright, 1991) and the specific practices for promoting emergent literacy that have been recommended in the literature (Swenson, 1999; Wormsley, 1997). The conceptual framework was also selected because it provides a description of the constructs underlying emergent and early literacy, rather than of the behavioral indicators or components of emergent literacy that are described in other models (see Mason & Stewart, 1990; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). This distinction is important, given the likelihood that there will be substantial behavioral differences in the demonstration of an increasing knowledge of literacy by young sighted children and those with visual impairments, particularly those who will read braille. …"

It was examined whether the LJT could be used with children from different age groups, whether associations between speech rhythm sensitivity, phonological awareness and reading skills could be observed and whether speech rhythm sensitivity could predict reading skills cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Study 1 piloted the LJT with 5to 9-year-old children and assessed the relationship between poor and good readers‟ speech rhythm sensitivity and their reading skills. Analyses showed that poor readers performed lower on the task compared to good readers, indicating that reduced stress sensitivity was related to lower reading proficiency. Examination of the task indicated potential fatigue effects, thus the task was shortened, which resulted in a 12-item tasks that was used through the remainder of the studies. Children between 4and 11-years old were assessed in three following studies and results showed differential associations between stress sensitivity and reading (related) skills; indicating an involvement of maturation in stress sensitivity‟s development but also highlighting that stress sensitivity is involved in reading skills differently across varying ages. The final study in this thesis examined the longitudinal effect of stress sensitivity on reading skills and it was found that stress sensitivity was not able to account for growth in reading skills, independently from vocabulary or phonological processing skills; although concurrently unique variance in reading skills was accountable to stress sensitivity. Overall, this thesis highlights the importance of stress sensitivity in children‟s reading development, offers supporting evidence for previously found associations between this skills and reading abilities and demonstrates the need to incorporate speech rhythm sensitivity in theoretical reading development models."
1,806507904,a behavioural and electrophysiological exploration of the working memory impairment in developmental dyslexia,2015,jumana ahmad,NA,0,0,93,"The current thesis provides a behavioural and electrophysiological exploration of Working Memory (WM) processing in developmental dyslexia. This thesis identifies a debate in the literature regarding the extent to which individuals with dyslexia have a specific phonological WM impairment, or a domain general Central Executive (CE) impairment. Predictions from the latter account suggest that dyslexics should show an impairment in visual, and verbal domains of WM. However, findings in the visual domain have been inconsistent, and research has predominantly focused on children. The experimental work in this thesis examines CE processing in dyslexic adults by assessing the behavioural and ERP responses associated with WM, across 8 experiments. Experiments 1-5 present stimuli in the visual domain, while Experiments 6-8 are conducted in the auditory domain. The results indicate that dyslexics are impaired for verbal information specifically, however subtle RT differences emerge during visual-spatial WM, when participants are required to manipulate information. In order to assess why effects are more robust in the phonological domain, Experiment 8 examines the contribution of auditory perceptual problems and phonological WM processing in dyslexia. The Temporal Sampling Theory of Developmental dyslexia (TSTDD; Goswami, 2011) specifies that dyslexics have a difficulty processing tones with long rise-times. NA In Experiment 8, dyslexic participants show a WM impairment that is specific to tones with long rise-times. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed, and a new hypothesis regarding the phonological WM impairment in dyslexia is proposed. The original contribution to knowledge of this thesis are threefold. 1) The ERP responses associated with WM processing in developmental dyslexia are examined across modality, using a range of stimuli. 2) NA A novel task is used to directly investigate CE processing in dyslexia (Experiment 5). 3) The TSTDD is applied in order to investigate phonological WM in dyslexia."

Preschool children with DLD who were assessed between 35 and 74 months for preschool language and speech abilities (Rapin, 1996) returned for language, speech and reading testing at age seven years. Children who enrolled in the study were a clinically referred sample, met criteria for average nonverbal intellectual functioning, and demonstrated below average performance on a composite language measure. To evaluate a hypothesis about the contribution of vocabulary, grammar, and speech articulation to reading outcome measures, a series of regression analyses tested models to identify predictors of reading achievement at age seven. Results indicated a strong, positive relationship between language skills assessed at both ages and reading comprehension. School-age language and speech skills explained 25% of the variance in reading comprehension after controlling for word identification skills. Grammar at school age was a significant unique predictor of reading comprehension. Preschool language and speech skills explained 22% of the variance after controlling for word identification skills. Speech articulation was not related to reading outcomes. In contrast, regression analyses suggested that language and speech skills did not predict word reading abilities. Children who had reading comprehension difficulties had weaker vocabulary, grammar and speech skills compared to children who had average and above comprehension skills. Findings support previous research describing a relationship between language skills and reading comprehension. Language skills measured at preschool can predict reading comprehension difficulties in elementary school for children with DLD. Results highlight the importance of early identification and intervention of language impairment in children to improve areas of vocabulary and grammar critical to reading success.

1,1485207763,neuropsychological instruction a process related approach in early reading skill development,2011,karen boyle donahue,NA,0,0,78,"Proficient and fluent reading ability for all Americans continues to be a highly prioritized, yet under achieved aspiration in current educational institutions. The acquisition of proficient reading fluency and comprehension are, undoubtedly, the most essential priorities in the academic development of school aged children, yet a discouraging number of students continue to struggle with the reading process throughout school aged years. Research has targeted key instructional areas that must be implemented in successful reading curriculum in the early childhood years. Namely, phonological awareness, phonics instruction, reading fluency, vocabulary development, and reading comprehension are core components that must be incorporated into literacy curricula and mastered by students as instruction is occurring in order to drive successful, long term reading outcomes. Advances in neurological research have added to current knowledge regarding how a child’s brain develops proficient reading ability. Neural networks are formed to create language systems, while brain plasticity in the first seven years of life allows for developmental manipulation. Despite these advances in knowledge and research, reading intervention continues to be reactive, and is usually applied after a student has fallen behind age expected benchmarks. There is a need for current research to demonstrate proactive methods to support successful literacy outcomes from the start of formal instruction, thereby thwarting the phenomenon of reading failure, and increasing reading proficiency for more students. Archival data were obtained from a program evaluation utilizing a pre/post test experimental design to measure reading gains for regular education Kindergarten students receiving balanced literacy instruction. The data were further examined to determine if students receiving balanced literacy Neuropsychological Instruction v instruction, in addition to the use of the PAL II Guides for Intervention as a proactive twelve week supplement to regular instruction, would realize greater gains in reading readiness than those students receiving balanced literacy instruction alone. All students (N = 31) who participated in the program evaluation were randomly assigned to one of two groups and received pre and post assessments in pre reading skill development. Findings indicate the use of a quality based, balanced literacy program does result in gains for writing legibility and speed; copying automaticity, legibility, and speed; receptive coding ability; auditory and verbal rhyming of words; phoneme segmentation and phoneme deletion; and syllable manipulation. Findings further indicate that the combined use of balanced literacy and the PAL II supplemental intervention yielded significant gains in writing automaticity, legibility and speed; copying automaticity, legibility, and speed; receptive coding; auditory and verbal rhyming of words; phoneme segmentation and phoneme deletion; syllabic manipulation; and verbal working memory. In an examination of the amount of measurable growth, those students receiving the PAL II supplement in addition to the balanced literacy program, made more statistically significant incremental gains than the group receiving balanced literacy alone in nine of the thirteen pre-reading skill variables. Medium effect sizes were noted for the balanced literacy plus intervention group over the balanced literacy group for writing automaticity, writing legibility, and copying automaticity. Large effect sizes were noted for the balanced literacy plus intervention group over the balanced literacy group for copying legibility, receptive coding, rhyming, syllables, phonemes, and verbal working memory. A small effect size was noted in writing speed but no effect size was noted for copying speed. These findings lend support to current research that emphasizes the importance of Neuropsychological Instruction vi developing successful pre-reading skill acquisition in the early childhood years via the proactive use of quality instruction and supplemental intervention. Research further denotes the importance of early instruction while critical neural development is occurring in young learner’s language systems. Results from this study support this finding, and can be utilized as a proactive strategy to enhance learning for all students at the beginning of formal school instruction. By doing so, more young students are likely to develop improved mastery of the skills needed to become successful future readers, and fewer students will be left to struggle with reading skill development throughout school aged years.

The study examined beliefs/perceptions of kindergarten teachers in regards to what reading skills students possess, the progress students make during a semester, how social-emotional skills affect the classroom environment and whether a literature-based social-emotional learning curriculum has a general impact. Two experimental and two control teachers participated in the study. There were fifty-three (N = 53) students who participated in the study. Forty (N = 40) students were assessed due to time constraints; twenty (N = 20) in the experimental group, twenty (N = 20) in the control group. Students were assessed using the Assessment of Children's Emotion Skills test, (Schultz, Izard, & Bear, 2004) to measure social awareness and emotional accuracy skills and the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) Next Assessment (Dynamic Measurement Group, 2011) to measure first sound and letter naming fluency both before and after implementation of Strong Start, the literature-based social skills curriculum. Qualitative data collected included teacher interviews, teacher reflective journals, fidelity check observations, communication logs, and researcher field notes. Results showed that while there was a change in scores on the ACES and DIBELS Next assessments from pretest to posttest for all groups and from experimental to control group, scores were not comparatively statistically different. The change in scores could not be attributed to the social-emotional learning curriculum. Gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, nor group had any effect on the scores for the ACES. However, white children did better than ""other"" students on the letter naming fluency DIBELS Next subtest. Experimental group students did not lose ground in reading, improved their problem-solving skills and enriched their social-emotional vocabulary. The data revealed classroom schedules filled with primarily teacher driven activities, core academics, and structure.

The project evaluated two intervention components: a two week camp for children and two training workshops for parents. Data were collected for five groups of participants. Three groups participated in one or more intervention components: parent workshops only group, child camp only group, and both parent workshops and child camp group. All children who participated in the interventions were identified by teachers as having difficulty in phonological awareness and word reading skills at the end of senior kindergarten. Two additional groups served as comparisons. Children in the 'low' comparison group had early literacy skills similar to children in the intervention groups. The 'average' comparison group included children that were identified by teachers as normally achieving in early literacy. The intervention programs sought to improve children's word reading ability by providing explicit instruction in phonological awareness and opportunities to practice other emergent literacy skills. Children participated in preand post-test assessments measuring literacy skills and general cognitive skills. Children in all three intervention groups showed positive change following the intervention compared to a comparison group of children with similar initial abilities who did not receive any intervention. Children who received both intervention components showed the most positive change following a follow-up assessment at the end of grade one. The frequency of home literacy activities with parents was related to positive improvement in children's phonological awareness and word reading skills. The quality of home literacy activities is also thought to be important. Results are presented in the context of the response-to-intervention framework for identifying children with reading disabilities."

An academic achievement test was administered to 129 children with mild or moderate ID when they were 6–8 years old, as well as one and two school years later. Findings indicated that phonological awareness and letter-sound knowledge at 6–8 years of age predicted progress in word and non-word reading after one school year and two school years after controlling for IQ, age, expressive vocabulary, spoken language, and type of placement. Phonological awareness and letter-sound knowledge at 6–8 years of age also predicted progress in reading comprehension after one school year and two school years. These findings suggest that training phonological awareness skills combined with explicit phonics instruction is important to foster reading progress in children with mild and moderate ID with unspecified etiology."

In order to determine the effects of alphabetic and nonalphabetic writing systems, the current study examined the influence of learning to read on oral language in English and Chinese speakers. Children (8–12 years olds) and adults made rhyming judgments to pairs of spoken words during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Developmental increases were seen only for English speakers in the left hemisphere phonological network (superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior parietal lobule, and inferior frontal gyrus). The increase in the STG was more pronounced for words with conflicting orthography (e.g. pint-mint; jazz-has) even though access to orthography was irrelevant to the task. Moreover, higher reading skill was correlated with greater activation in the STG only for English speaking children. The effects suggest that learning to read reorganizes the phonological awareness network only for alphabetic and not logographic writing systems because of differences in the principles for mapping between orthographic and phonological representations. The reorganization of the auditory cortex may result in better phonological awareness skills in alphabetic readers."

This is apparent when a child at risk of dyslexia first starts to attempt to read. Dyslexic children struggle to grasp and automate the alphabetic principle (ie, they cannot “sound out” words or use phonemic decoding strategies) and therefore have difficulty deciphering unfamiliar words that they have not encountered before. Even though many of these words are part of the child's oral vocabulary, the child cannot recognize them in printed form. As a result, reading can be extremely laborious and time-consuming, fraught with errors, and altogether an unrewarding, aversive experience. To be an efficient reader, one must be able to rapidly and effortlessly recognize many words by sight, and for a child to acquire this facility requires multiple exposures to these words.

Substantial evidence shows that dyslexic readers have problems with rapid naming of visual items. Early research assumed that this was a consequence of phonological processing deficits, but recent findings suggest that non-phonological processes may lie at the root of the association between slow naming speed and poor reading. The hypothesis that rapid naming reflects an independent core deficit in dyslexia is supported by the main findings: (1) some dyslexics are characterized by rapid naming difficulties but intact phonological skills; (2) evidence for an independent association between rapid naming and reading competence in the dyslexic readers, when the effect of phonological skills was controlled; (3) rapid naming and phonological processing measures are not reliably correlated. Recent research also reveals greater predictive power of rapid naming, in particular the inter-item pause time, for high-frequency word reading compared to pseudoword reading in developmental dyslexia. Altogether, the results are more consistent with the view that a phonological component alone cannot account for the rapid naming performance in dyslexia. Rather, rapid naming problems may emerge from the inefficiencies in visual-orthographic processing as well as in phonological processing."

Surprisingly, empirical researchers and policy makers have by and large paid little attention to the effects that early reading instruction has on later reading development. In this critical review, I outline five main arguments for early reading and examine their logical and evidential basis. Then I present research that has compared groups of children over the long-term as a function of whether they received early formal reading instruction or not. I conclude, on the basis of the evidence and critique, that children do not show better long-term reading performance that is attributable to their having received earlier formal reading instruction.

These two broad skills explained separate parts of the variance on both outcome measures, while revealing opposite effects: phonological skills explained more variance for alphabetic reading skills and oral comprehension explained more variance for reading comprehension. We also assessed the effects of two preschool training programmes focusing on either phonological awareness or comprehension skills.

The efficacy of phonological awareness instruction at the preschool level is discussed, as well as the research implications for best practice in teaching it. Shared book reading plays an important role in facilitating oral language development in young children. Two types of shared bookreading techniques (dialogic and non-dialogic) are reviewed, and their effect on oral language outcomes is examined. A plethora of research has examined phonological awareness intervention in preschool and kindergarten, but much less research is available on shared book-reading interventions in these settings.

Reading is a complex task involving perceptual, motor, linguistic, phonological, and memory components, each of which has a crucial role in determining reading rate. High poverty rates continue to have a negative impact on human resource development and education quality in Africa, further complicating the ability of most countries to reach the Education for All (EFA) and Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Moreover, Africa and Asia are hosts to most of the world's multilingual countries, in which textbook availability in major indigenous languages is sorely lacking. Therefore, it is important to take all possible steps to maximize the effectiveness of teaching interventions. In parallel, also the quality of textbooks is a crucial factor for quality education, especially in developing countries. It is important to dispose of well-written and well-designed textbooks, because the quality of textbook can be an important predictor of student learning and can contribute to the effective use of instructional time and classroom teaching. This review examines the evidence regarding variables influencing acquisition of decoding and comprehension reading skills. One important caveat is in order. While the educational, psychological and neuroscience literature on reading is extensive, it largely depends upon studies on English speaking individuals. The first part of the review focuses on studies of visual psychophysics and examines the visual limitations affecting reading and its development. The second part of the review draws on the psychological and neuroscience literature to examine the role of several variables influencing reading acquisition, such as letter knowledge, teaching method, teacher's competence, orthographic consistency."

Brain imaging studies are contributing to our understanding of the neural correlates of successful reading intervention, as well as the link between dyslexia-associated genes and brain-based measures.

Children (N = 54) performed at chance level in kindergarten but chose nonwords with frequent doublets significantly more often than expected by chance in first and second grade. Correlations between children's orthographic knowledge and their reading and spelling skills were not found. The results indicate that knowledge of frequent double consonants is evident in German-speaking children from first grade onwards, but it is not related to their reading and spelling performance.

When one is considered a normal reader, he or she does not encounter much difficulty in reading and understanding texts. There are, however, children who have problems with phoneme identification and thus do not read well and they also have difficulties in comprehending texts. These learners should be identified and be assisted so that they can proceed with their learning lives. This study was guided by the following objectives: to investigate phonological awareness of learners with reading disability; to establish the correlation among the various measures of phonological awareness and to determine the significance of rapid automatic naming in reading. A sample of pupils in class six from the selected schools in Nairobi County was used in the study. Phonological awareness skills of these learners were tested to find out the nature of their awareness and skills in the tasks that were given. This study adopted an eclectic theoretical approach. The following theories guided the study: the Phonological Awareness Theory which states that reading based on the alphabetic system requires that readers be aware that words are made up of individual sounds and the Rapid Naming Theory which states that a good reader is one who has the ability to recall quickly and verbalize the names of presented objects which could also be individual alphabetical letters. The data were obtained from tape - recorded texts from the respondents and analysed to establish their nature of phonological awareness. Descriptive statistics which includes measures of central tendency and measures of correlation were used to summarize and describe the data. Tape recorded data were transcribed, analysed and then discussed. The results indicate that the respondents displayed phonological awareness skills in some PA tasks and experienced difficulties in some of the PA tasks. The study also found that there was no significant difference between the genders in their performances in the phonological awareness tasks. Various deficits in phonological awareness were also observed. These were categorized as mis-articulations of substitution, phoneme deletion, phoneme insertion, reading of the entire word instead of identifying the sounds; spelling the words; atypical and segmentation. It was also noted that there were correlations among the various measures of phonological awareness and absence of correlation among others. This showed that pupils have to be taught in all the measures for them to have phonological awareness skills. The study also looked at the significance of naming speed (RAN) in reading.

Additionally, we examined gender differences in the development of letter writing skills. 471 children aged 3 to 5 years old completed a letter writing task. Results from factor analyses indicated that letter writing represented a unidimensional skill. Similar to research findings that the development of letter-names and letter-sound knowledge varies in acquisition, our findings indicate that the ability to write some letters is acquired earlier than the ability to write other letters. Although there appears to be an approximate sequence for the easiest and most difficult letters, there appears to be a less clear sequence for letters in the middle stages of development. Overall, girls had higher letter writing scores compared to boys. Gender differences regarding difficulty writing specific letters was less conclusive; however, results indicated that when controlling for ability level, girls had a higher probability of writing a letter correctly than boys. Implications of these findings for the assessment and instruction of letter writing are discussed."

Kindergarten children (N = 90) who were identified as at risk for reading difficulties were stratified by school and randomly assigned to receive (a) Early Reading Intervention (ERI; Pearson/Scott Foresman, 2004) modified in response to student performance or (b) their schools’ typical supplemental reading intervention (regrouping and curriculum pacing adjustments). In both conditions, intervention was provided 30 minutes per day in small groups for approximately 100 sessions. Results indicated no statistically significant group differences on any outcome measures. Between-group effect sizes revealed substantively important differences (Valentine & Cooper, 2003) favoring the ERI responsive condition on multiple measures with effect sizes ranging from .35 to .59. Overall, findings indicated that the majority of students in both Tier 2 intervention conditions performed above the 30th percentile on posttest measures of word reading measures."

The results showed that, after controlling for nonverbal IQ and vocabulary, home literacy instruction prior to kindergarten, parents' beliefs about their children's reading ability, and children's task-focused behavior were significant predictors of two or more of the dependent variables. Storybook reading did not account for unique variance in any of the dependent variables."

Using Structural Equation Modeling, this study examined the measurement and structural relations of the rate and accuracy of variables important in early reading: phonemic blending, letter sounds, phonograms, decoding, single-word reading, reading comprehension, and text reading as well as reading comprehension among second grade readers. The effects from phonemic blending fluency and letter sound fluency to decoding were completely mediated by phonogram fluency, decoding fluency, single-word reading fluency, and reading comprehension had direct effects on the text reading fluency of the second grade students. Understanding the relationship among the many component skills of readers early in their reading development is important because a deficiency in any of the component skills has the potential to affect the development of other skills and, ultimately, the development of the child as a proficient reader."

AIM: to determine the possible gain in performance in tasks involving phonemic awareness skills in boys and girls, following the development of a program to stimulate phonemic awareness. METHOD: participants were 18 boys and 18 girls, all with typical language development, in their second grade of Elementary Education. The study involved three steps. The first and third steps consisted of an auditory screening, speech and language assessments and the assessment of phonemic awareness skills, through the Phonological Awareness Tasks Protocol. The second step involved the planning of the phonological awaress stimulation program and its application in the classroom. RESULTS: boys and girls presented an improvement in their performance in all of the phonological awareness tasks after the application of the stimulation program; this improvement was statistically significant. Regarding the influence of gender, it was observed that prior to the application of the stimulation program, there was a significant difference between boys and girls in the task involving the detection of a phoneme in the last position. After stimulation, this difference remained significant in the same task, and was also statistically significant for the tasks of phonemic segmentation of words with six phonemes and phoneme reversion of words with two or three phonemes. CONCLUSION: it is observed that girls performed better in the majority of the phonemic awareness tasks, and that the program was effective in stimulating these tasks."

1,1970181216,the nature of phonological awareness throughout the elementary grades an item response theory perspective,2009,"judith vloedgraven, ludo verhoeven",learning and individual differences,1,30,56,"In the present study, the nature of Dutch children's phonological awareness was examined throughout the elementary school grades. Phonological awareness was assessed using five different sets of items that measured rhyming, phoneme identification, phoneme blending, phoneme segmentation, and phoneme deletion. A sample of 1405 children from kindergarten through fourth grade participated. Results of modified parallel analysis and analyses within the context of item response theory (IRT) showed phonological awareness to be unidimensional across different tasks and grades. Despite the evidence for a single underlying ability, the cognitive task requirements for the various tasks were found to differ. In addition to some overlap between the item sets, those for rhyming, phoneme identification, and phoneme blending were easier than those for phoneme segmentation and phoneme deletion. The results lend support to the assumption that phonological awareness is a continuum of availability for phonological representations which can range from partial availability (i.e., access) to full availability (i.e., access)."

The relation between early number competence and mathematics achievement was strong and significant throughout the study period. A sequential process growth curve model showed that kindergarten number competence predicted rate of growth in mathematics achievement between 1st and 3rd grades as well as achievement level through 3rd grade. Further, rate of growth in early number competence predicted mathematics performance level in 3rd grade. Although low-income children performed more poorly than their middle-income counterparts in mathematics achievement and progressed at a slower rate, their performance and growth were mediated through relatively weak kindergarten number competence. Similarly, the better performance and faster growth of children who entered kindergarten at an older age were explained by kindergarten number competence. The findings show the importance of early number competence for setting children’s learning trajectories in elementary school mathematics."

1,1980600287,the interrelationships of mathematical precursors in kindergarten,2011,paul t cirino,journal of experimental child psychology,1,95,75,"Previous efforts have evaluated several potential predictors of mathematical performance in children at the kindergarten level (Geary, Hoard, & Hamson, 1999; Geary, Hamson, & Hoard, 2000; Gersten, Jordan, & Flojo, 2005; Jordan, Kaplan, Olah & Locuniak, 2006; Jordan, Kaplan, Locuniak & Ramineni, 2007; Koponen, Aunola, Ahonen, & Nurmi, 2007; Stock, Desoete, & Roeyers, 2007). Predictors that involve an understanding of quantity, that utilize counting, or that in some way tap “number sense” have recently received much attention, although subdivisions within this area are not always clear. In contrast to such number or quantitative predictors, there is also a large body of research that implicates non-quantitative cognitive skills, particularly domain general skills such as working memory, in the expression of math skill (e.g., Bull, Espy, & Wiebe, 2008; Geary, 2004; Swanson, 2006; Swanson, Jerman, & Zheng, 2008). Language and reading skills are also frequently implicated in discussions of math ability and disability in general (Jordan & Hanich, 2003; Jordan, Kaplan, & Hanich, 2002; Geary, 1993; Gersten et al., 2005), with several studies specifically assessing the role of phonological skills or other reading related skills such as rapid naming as predictors of mathematical outcomes (Geary, Hoard, Byrd-Craven, Nugent, & Numtee, 2007; Hecht, Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 2001; Krajewski & Schneider, 2009).

While many studies evaluate the relationships of the above types of precursors to math, there are a much smaller number that evaluate them in a multivariate context, and still fewer that do so in the context of a comprehensive model. Thus, little is known about how these sets of precursors relate to one another, which has implications for the extent to which they may have unique contributions to math performance. Recently, however, LeFevre and colleagues (LeFevre, Fast, Skwarchuck, Smith-Chant, Bisanz et al., in press) have proposed a model (the “pathways” model) relating the three types of precursors described above to mathematical achievement, and this serves as a framework for the present study. The current study contributes to existing research by: (a) evaluating the three pathways of LeFevre et al. (in press) at the level of latent rather than observed variables; (b) assessing the quantity domain comprehensively and distinguishing between core and mediating precursors therein; (c) establishing the relationship of these latent variables to a measure of small sums addition; and (d) examining performance in a relatively large and diverse sample at the kindergarten level, after students have been exposed to a formal learning environment, but have not yet completed development of their procedural arithmetic skills. Understanding what predicts early mathematical performance is crucial given the importance of these skills for more complex mathematical skill many years later (Duncan et al., 2007)."

METHODS: Forty-three preschool children - 19 male and 24 female - were submitted to a complete speech-language pathology screening, and carried out an evaluation of their writing level and their PA abilities. The data were statistically analyzed using Two-Way and One-Way ANOVA. RESULTS: As a result, there was a statistically significant relationship between PA and gender in subjects with syllabic-alphabetical and alphabetical writing levels. Awareness for words was more developed among male subjects, while female individuals had significantly better performances in syllabic segmentation tasks with three-syllable words, which evidenced their better abilities in dealing with syllabic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: It's concluded that the female subjects showed greater ability to analyze smaller units in longer words, which might suggest a possible relationship between the low rate of phonological deviations in female individuals and their better performance in PA."

Participants were 3,448 economically disadvantaged students (50% spoke Spanish at home) from 243 schools. Regression analyses demonstrated that kindergarten variables accounted for similar percentages of variance in first grade reading for both Spanish speakers (43% in fall, 46% in spring) and non-Spanish speakers (49% in fall, 46% in spring) and that fall and spring variables were equally effective in predicting later achievement for both groups."

Groups, separately and combined, showed a significant relationship between decoding, phonological awareness variables, word decoding, and successive processing that has also been observed among children from the mainstream culture. In general, the cognitive processing, reading, and reading subskills of First Nations children are, on average, below the norms for these measures. The findings are discussed in terms of reading disability identification practices from a Discrepancy Model and the Consistency–Discrepancy Model using PASS (Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive) theory among First Nations children."

The authors examine naming speed's effects across languages and the shape of its relationship to reading. Also considered is the double-deficit hypothesis, by which students with both slow naming speed and low phonological awareness are hypothesized to be most at-risk for reading disability. Finally, the instructional literature regarding attempts to improve naming speed and use of naming speed as a predictor of response to intervention is reviewed. The authors conclude that naming speed is uniquely associated with a range of reading tasks across orthographies, and that early identification would be improved by the inclusion of naming speed measures. The poor response to instruction of students who have slow naming speed should be considered when designing interventions. Further work is required to specify the theoretical nature of naming speed and to determine how to help students with slow naming speed.

On analyse dans cet article les interpretations theoriques courantes de la vitesse de denomination et la litterature de recherche concernant ses relations avec la lecture. Les auteurs analysent les effets de la vitesse de lecture a travers les langues et la forme de sa relation a la lecture. On analyse egalement l'hypothese du double deficit selon laquelle les eleves ayant a la fois une vitesse de denomination lente et une conscience phonologique faible sont consideres comme presentant le plus de risques de difficultes en lecture. On analyse enfin la litterature pedagogique sur les essais d'amelioration de la vitesse de lecture et d'utilisation de la vitesse de denomination comme predicteur de la reponse a l'intervention. Les auteurs concluent que la vitesse de denomination est associee uniquement a un ensemble de tâches de lecture liees a l'orthographe, et que l'identification precoce pourrait etre amelioree si elle incluait des evaluations de la vitesse de lecture. Les reponses mediocres des eleves qui ont une vitesse de denomination lente devraient etre prises en consideration lors de la planification des interventions.

В статье рассматриваются современные теоретические взгляды на проблему, связанную со скоростью называния предметов, и исследования, посвященные связям подобной проблемы с навыками чтения. Авторы изучают разнообразные проявления этих связей на примере различных языков. Помимо прочего рассматривается гипотеза “двойного дефицита”, согласно которой ученики с низкой скоростью называния предметов и низкой способностью различения звуков считаются наиболее вероятными кандидатами в группу слабо читающих детей. И, наконец, рассматривается учебная литература, где описаны попытки повысить скорость называния предметов, поскольку она принята за индикатор потенциальной реакции на любое вмешательство. Выводы авторов состоят в том, что скорость называния предметов корректируется исключительно сочетанием заданий по чтению и орфографии и такие задания способствуют раннему выявлению проблем с чтением. При планировании учебного вмешательства следует учитывать, с какой скоростью ученики способны называть предметы. Требуются дальнейшие исследования, чтобы окончательно определить теоретическую подоснову этого навыка и характер помощи, в которой нуждаются ученики с низкой скоростью называния предметов.

En este articulo se examinan las interpretaciones teoricas mas recientes de la rapidez de nombrar y la literatura sobre la investigacion en cuanto a su relacion con la lectura. Los autores examinan el efecto de la rapidez de nombrar a traves de los idiomas y la forma en que se relaciona a la lectura. Tambien se examina la hipotesis de la doble deficiencia, la cual considera que los estudiantes lentos al nombrar y de poca conciencia fonologica estan a alto riesgo de tener dificultades con la lectura. Por ultimo, se revisa la literatura instruccional sobre los intentos de mejorar no solo la rapidez de nombrar sino tambien su uso como predictor de dificultades al leer. Los autores llegan a la conclusion que la rapidez de nombrar tiene una relacion especial con una serie de tareas de lectura a traves de las ortografias, y que se mejoraria la identificacion temprana si se incluyeran medidas de la rapidez de nombrar. La poca respuesta a la instruccion de estudiantes de baja rapidez de nombrar se debe tomar en cuenta al disenar intervenciones. Se necesitan mas estudios para especificar la base teorica de la rapidez de nombrar y para determinar como ayudar a los estudiantes con una baja rapidez de nombrar."

We administered a comprehensive battery of predictor tests that have been correlated with L1 decoding and comprehension skills in English to English-speaking students in early total French immersion at the beginning and end of kindergarten. Tests of word and pseudo-word decoding and reading comprehension in French were given at the end of grade 1. The best kindergarten predictors of L2 decoding were knowledge of the alphabetic principle in English, phonological awareness in English, and knowledge of French at kindergarten entry. The same variables were significant predictors of French reading comprehension, with the added contribution of scores related to oral language skills in L1. The results provide support for the SVR intra-linguistically, but not cross-linguistically."

Analyses of the group’s scores on an array of assessments in English revealed four significant results: (1) the development of English vocabulary favored the groups with at or above Spanish receptive vocabulary, (2) Spanish phonemic awareness helped the acquisition of English phonemic awareness but appeared not to influence other assessment results unless combined with Spanish receptive vocabulary, (3) the advantages of Spanish phonemic awareness in the absence of Spanish r..."
1,1996372715,a dominance analysis approach to determining predictor importance in third seventh and tenth grade reading comprehension skills,2014,"elizabeth l tighe, christopher schatschneider",reading and writing,1,30,70,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate and rank order by importance the contributions of various cognitive predictors to reading comprehension in third, seventh, and tenth graders. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that for third grade, the best fit was a four-factor solution including Fluency, Verbal Reasoning, Nonverbal Reasoning, and Working Memory factors. For seventh and tenth grade, three-factor solutions with Fluency, Reasoning, and Working Memory factors were the best fit. The three and four-factor models were used in separate dominance analyses for each grade to rank order the factors by predictive importance to reading comprehension. Results indicated that Fluency and Verbal Reasoning were the most important predictors of third grade reading comprehension. For seventh grade, Fluency and Reasoning were the most important predictors. By tenth grade, Reasoning was the most important predictor of reading comprehension. Working Memory was the least predictive of reading comprehension across all grade levels. These results suggest that inferential reasoning skills become an important contributor to reading comprehension at increasing grade levels."
1,1996971949,moving to assessment guided differentiated instruction to support young children s alphabet knowledge,2014,shayne b piasta,the reading teacher,1,9,52,"Early childhood educators are increasingly asked to support the alphabet knowledge development of children enrolled in their classrooms. Children in the same classroom, however, often show vastly different alphabet learning needs. Moreover, recent research suggests that some letters are more difficult to learn. These facts run counter to one-size-fits-all whole-class instructional approaches, which typically provide the same instruction to all children and for all letters. The purpose of this article is to encourage early childhood educators to move beyond whole-class approaches and instead provide alphabet instruction that is aligned with current emphases on assessment-driven decision making and differentiated instruction. The article reviews the importance of alphabet knowledge with respect to theory, research, and the current educational context, summarizes recent research concerning children's alphabet knowledge development, and provides a framework in which assessment guides differentiated alphabet instruction, along with empirically-validated practices for such instruction."

The reviews were selected on the basis that they either had been commissioned by federal governments or had been conducted by reputable research institutions and had been released in the past 10 years. A search of published literature pertaining to the topic found three federal reviews (from the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia), a What Works Clearinghouse Report into beginning reading programmes, a review of reading interventions by Slavin et al. and a synthesis of meta-analyses by Hattie. Analysis of these reviews indicated that there are key commonalities in findings about how to teach reading to young students. Reviews of interventions revealed some flaws and therefore provide limited information useful to programme implementation and development for young struggling readers."
1,1999144576,efficiency of predicting risk in word reading using fewer easier letters,2011,"yaacov petscher, youngsuk kim",assessment for effective intervention,1,4,38,"Letter-name identification has been widely used as part of early screening to identify children who might be at risk for future word reading difficulty. The goal of the present study was to examine whether a reduced set of letters could have similar diagnostic accuracy rather than a full set (i.e., 26 letters) when used as a screen. First, we examined whether a hierarchical scale existed among letters by using a Mokken scale analysis. Then, we contrasted diagnostic accuracy among the 5, 10, 15, and 20 easiest letters, with all 26 letters by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and indices of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive power, and negative predictive power. Results demonstrated that a hierarchical scale existed among items in the letter-name knowledge test. In addition, assessing students on the easiest 15 letters was not statistically distinguished from all 26 letters in diagnostic accuracy. The implications of the results for the use of a Mokken scale analysis in educational research are discussed."

Data from 2 samples representing diverse regions, ethnicity, and socioeconomic backgrounds ( n s = 1074 and 500) were analyzed using item response theory (IRT) and differential item functioning techniques. Results from factor analyses indicated that letter name knowledge represented a unidimensional skill; IRT results yielded significant differences between letters in both difficulty and discrimination. Results also indicated an approximate developmental sequence in letter name learning for the simplest and most challenging to learn letters—but with no clear sequence between these extremes. Findings also suggested that children were most likely to first learn their first initial. We discuss implications for assessment and instruction."

This study investigated the English and Chinese language performance of students enrolled in early English immersion in a Chinese primary school. In addition, factors that could predict successful English word recognition were investigated. There were 183 participants who were tested in both Chinese and English word identification, phonological awareness, and vocabulary, as well as English oral proficiency and letter name knowledge. The immersion students performed significantly better than the non-immersion group on measures of English vocabulary, word identification, and oral proficiency, without any detrimental effects on their Chinese character reading, which made the program, in effect, an additive bilingual system. In addition, phonological awareness and letter name knowledge proved to be strong predictors of English word identification for the immersion students, a finding that was similar to results obtained in studies of native English-speaking children. The findings have potentially useful pedagogical applications."

Measures of orthographic learning and word reading were included in the analyses to determine how these patterned with the learning processes. An exploratory factor analysis of the genetic correlations among the variables indicated a three-factor model. Vocabulary tests loaded on the first factor, the Grade 2 measures of word reading and orthographic learning, plus preschool letter knowledge, loaded on the second, and the third was characterized by tests of verbal short-term memory. The three genetic factors correlated, with the second (print) factor showing the most specificity. We conclude that genetically influenced learning processes underlying print–speech integration, foreshadowed by preschool letter knowledge, have a degree of independence from genetic factors affecting spoken language.

The researcher served as the interactive writing teacher for the treatment group, rotating to five different classrooms in one Head Start center 3–4 days a week for 13 weeks. Children in the treatment group received a 10–15 min interactive writing lesson each day in small groups within their own classroom settings. Children in the control group received standard literacy instruction in small groups with their own classroom teachers. Child outcome data on upper case, lower case, and letter sound identification were collected before and after the intervention for both groups. Based on the large frequency of zeros on outcomes, zero-inflated Poisson regression analyses were performed. The results of the study showed that children receiving interactive writing identified more lower case and upper case letters at the end of the study relative to children in the control, but no differences were observed on letter sounds. While continued evaluation of the interactive writing strategy is needed in the preschool setting, the evidence from the current study shows encouraging trends in alphabet knowledge skill development as a result of this strategy."

Traditional letter and numeral identification assessments score children's responses as either correct or incorrect and this approach can underestimate what children know. The present study tested an assessment scale that scored three- and four-year-old children's (N = 69; M age = 49.17 months) responses along a continuum from no letter and numeral name knowledge, to using a mix of non-conventional and conventional names, through to full mastery. Compared to traditional scoring, the new scale was more comprehensive because it included more elements of each child's emerging knowledge of letter and numeral identification and was more sensitive to individual differences among children. The emergent print identification scale can be used to inform learning and teaching in the early years classroom and be used in early literacy research."

1,2012881117,early childhood educators perceived and actual metalinguistic knowledge beliefs and enacted practice about teaching early reading,2015,lorraine hammond,australian journal of learning difficulties,1,8,41,"Results of influential reports on early literacy have drawn attention to the need for early childhood educators to take up a more explicit, teacher-directed approach to beginning reading. Positive classroom results however are in part dependent upon teacher knowledge and this study investigated the relationship between early childhood educators’ linguistic knowledge, beliefs and enacted practice about teaching reading. Results indicate that while early childhood educators believe knowledge about teaching reading is ‘very important’ to their role, their understanding of literacy precursor skills was generally low. When observed teaching beginning reading, most participants demonstrated some capacity to plan and teach in an explicit way; however, their enacted practice was inconsistent with their teacher knowledge results. This suggests the ability to reflect on the sound structure of spoken words and apply this knowledge to learning to read is a different skill to planning instructional sequences to teach ..."

Parents in three groups (119 mothers, 5 fathers) were coached to mediate child learning, respectively, in: interactive storybook reading, writing, or visuomotor skills. A group-specific workshop was followed by 7 weeks of tri-weekly structured dyadic interactions and weekly tutorial home visits. A fourth group (control) received no intervention. Results showed implementation success: Mothers coached in interactive storybook reading or writing mediation improved in the coached activity from pretest to immediate posttest and to delayed posttest. Interactive storybook reading improved less for older than younger children, whereas writing mediation improved more for older than younger children. No transfer emerged from one activity to the other: Coaching on reading had no effect on writing or visuomotor skills, and coaching of writing had an effect only on writing. Children’s alphabetic skills were enhanced in the writing mediation-coached group, whereas linguistic competencies, unexpectedly, were not enhanced in the interactive storybook reading-coached group. The significance of writing mediation as a dyadic activity promoting literacy is emphasized."

However, the degree to which dorsal stream deficits play a causal role in reading failure has not been established. This study used coherent motion and visual frequency doubling to examine whether dorsal stream sensitivity measured before the commencement of formal reading instruction can predict emerging literacy skills in Grade 1. We demonstrate that over age, IQ and Kindergarten Letter knowledge, pre-reading measures of dorsal stream functioning, as assessed by frequency doubling sensitivity, could predict early literacy skills. These findings suggest that the relationship between dorsal stream functioning and poor reading skills exists before children learn to read, strengthening the claim that dorsal stream deficits may play a contributing role in reading failure."

Over the past four decades, a large body of evidence has indicated that reading acquisition is strongly associated with a child's listening skills, particularly the child's sensitivity to phonological structures of spoken language. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that the close relationship between reading and listening is manifested universally across languages and that behavioral remediation using strategies addressing phonological awareness alleviates reading difficulties in dyslexics. The prevailing view of the central role of phonological awareness in reading development is largely based on studies using Western (alphabetic) languages, which are based on phonology. The Chinese language provides a unique medium for testing this notion, because logographic characters in Chinese are based on meaning rather than phonology. Here we show that the ability to read Chinese is strongly related to a child's writing skills and that the relationship between phonological awareness and Chinese reading is much weaker than that in reports regarding alphabetic languages. We propose that the role of logograph writing in reading development is mediated by two possibly interacting mechanisms. The first is orthographic awareness, which facilitates the development of coherent, effective links among visual symbols, phonology, and semantics; the second involves the establishment of motor programs that lead to the formation of long-term motor memories of Chinese characters. These findings yield a unique insight into how cognitive systems responsible for reading development and reading disability interact, and they challenge the prominent phonological awareness view."

Multilevel hierarchical linear analyses revealed statistically significant effects favoring the explicit/systematic intervention on alphabetic, phonemic, and untimed decoding skills with substantive effect sizes on all measures except word identification and passage comprehension. Group performance did not differ statistically on more advanced reading and spelling skills. Findings support the efficacy of both supplemental interventions and suggest the benefit of the more explicit/systematic intervention for children who are most at risk of reading difficulty."

A special challenge for the application of the language-rich curriculum and professional development package implemented in this study was the presence of a large proportion of ELL children in essentially English-speaking classrooms. We, therefore, sought to determine whether the program was effective for improving English language and literacy outcomes for English-language learners as well as native English speakers. There were large and significant differences between treatment and control groups on literacy outcomes for all students. On the literacy tasks, ELL students in the treatment groups performed nearly as well or better than non-ELL students at the beginning of kindergarten, and reached national norms on standardized tests. There were also significant program impacts on some language outcomes for all students. ELL students who received the intervention significantly outperformed ELL students in the control groups on English receptive and expressive vocabulary. On the more complex oral comprehension skills, preschool did not have a significant impact for ELL students. Intervention effects on receptive vocabulary and oral comprehension for native speakers were found only for the third cohort and were not found for expressive vocabulary. These results provide evidence that, given material supports, coaching, professional development, and the use of a language and literacy-focused curriculum, prekindergarten classrooms can enable low-SES children from diverse language backgrounds to enter kindergarten with literacy skills at or near national norms and can significantly impact some language skills. While non-native speakers of English continued to score lower on language measures than their native-speaking peers, results show that 1 year of preschool can put all children on a positive trajectory for long-term success in school."

De nombreuses etudes ont souligne l’importance des connaissances metaphonologiques et orthographiques (connaissance des lettres et des associations graphophonologiques developpees au cours de l’apprentissage de la lecture). Nous nous sommes donc interesses aux liens existants entre ces differentes connaissances ainsi qu’aux liens qu’elles entretiennent avec le decodage au cours de l’annee scolaire. Pour ce faire, nous avons propose a 40 enfants, en decembre et en avril, des epreuves d’habiletes metaphonemiques (identification de phoneme en position initiale et finale dans les mots), de connaissance du son et du nom (denomination et identification) des lettres et une tâche de decodage de pseudomots. Pour la connaissance du nom des lettres, deux types de mesures ont ete proposes, une mesure de precision et une mesure de rapidite evaluant l’automatisation de l’acces a cette connaissance. Les nombres moyens de reponses correctes et les temps de reaction moyens recueillis pour chaque enfant, en debut et en fin d’annee, ont ete utilises pour differentes analyses correlationnelles. Les resultats revelent qu’en decembre, la connaissance du nom des lettres jouerait un role dans le developpement des habiletes metaphonemiques et dans la decouverte et l’acquisition des associations lettres-sons (evaluees avec une tâche de connaissance du son des lettres). La connaissance du nom des lettres pourrait donc influencer indirectement, via l’amelioration de ces competences, le niveau de decodage ulterieur des enfants. De plus, le lien direct entre la connaissance du nom des lettres et les capacites de decodage, deja observe en decembre, se confirme. Enfin, l’analyse des mesures de rapidite de l’utilisation de la connaissance du nom des lettres montre que les enfants qui denomment un nombre important de lettres sont aussi ceux qui les denomment le plus rapidement. Ce dernier resultat laisse supposer qu’un certain niveau de connaissance du nom des lettres doit etre atteint avant de pouvoir automatiser son utilisation. L’ensemble des resultats confirme l’importance, dans les premiers temps de l’apprentissage de la lecture, d’une bonne connaissance du nom des lettres. Nous suggerons egalement, pour une meilleure comprehension des mecanismes d’acquisition de la lecture et de ces composantes, la prise en compte d’indices refletant l’automatisation de l’utilisation de la connaissance du nom des lettres."

Conventional mathematics achievement was then assessed at the end of both first and third grades. Controlling for age and cognitive abilities (i.e., language, spatial, and memory), number sense made a unique and meaningful contribution to the variance in mathematics achievement at both first and third grades. Furthermore, the strength of the predictions did not weaken over time. Number sense was most strongly related to the ability to solve applied mathematics problems presented in various contexts. The number sense screen taps important intermediate skills that should be considered in the development of early mathematics assessments and interventions."
1,2028835709,early language and reading development of bilingual preschoolers from low income families,2006,"carol scheffner hammer, adele w miccio",topics in language disorders,1,34,40,"Learning to read is a complex process and a number of factors affect a child's success in beginning reading. This complexity increases when a child's home language differs from that of the school and when the child comes from a home with limited economic resources. This article discusses factors that have been shown to contribute to children's success in early reading, namely-phonological awareness, letter-word identification, oral language, and the home literacy environment. Preliminary evidence suggests that bilingual children from low-income backgrounds initially perform poorly on phonological awareness and letter identification tasks, but appear to acquire these abilities quickly in kindergarten once these abilities are emphasized in early reading instruction. In addition, the findings show that bilingual preschoolers' receptive language abilities in English and Spanish positively impact their early letter-word identification abilities at the end of kindergarten. A positive relationship between bilingual preschoolers' home literacy environment and early reading outcomes has not been found to date. Educational implications for serving young, bilingual children from programs such as Head Start are discussed."

To address this issue, we examined the degree of overlap among etiological influences of pre-reading skills in 1,252 twin pairs in kindergarten. Genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared environmental factors were significant for all three literacy phenotypes. The majority of genetic and shared environmental influence on decoding was due to common factors that included print awareness and phonological awareness. Notably, only a single genetic factor contributed to all three literacy phenotypes but there was additional shared environmental influence common to phonological awareness and decoding. Findings suggest commonalities in the etiology of pre-reading literacy skills that could inform work on the development of reading skill."

Between early developing oral language skills and fluent reading comprehension emerge several types of metalinguistic ability, including phonological and morphological awareness. In this study, a developmental sequence is proposed, beginning with receptive language followed by phonological awareness, morphological awareness, and a new metalinguistic task measuring oral morphophonological accuracy (MPA), followed by decoding and culminating in reading comprehension. MPA is a measure of accurate primary stress placement in the production of derived words with non-neutral, stress changing suffixes (e.g., -ity). A path analysis with data from 76 third graders was used to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of these variables. The developmental model was confirmed, and a metalinguistic continuum, with MPA emerging after both PA and MA, was supported. Decoding and receptive language were the best unique predictors of reading comprehension. Surprisingly, MPA was more important to decoding than was PA, whereas MA was only indirectly implicated in both decoding and reading comprehension."

Hebrew letter names have been claimed to be less useful in this regard. In Study 1, kindergartners were asked to report and spell the initial and final letters in Hebrew words, including full (CVC), partial (CV), and phonemic (C) cues derived from these letter names (e.g., kaftor, kartis, kibel, spelled with /kaf/). Correct and biased responses increased with the length of congruent and incongruent cues, respectively. In Study 2, preschoolers and kindergartners were asked to report the initial letters of monosyllabic or disyllabic names (e.g., /kaf/ and /samex/, respectively) that included the cues described above. Correct responses increased with cue length; the effect was stronger with monosyllabic over disyllabic letter names, probably because the cue covered a larger ratio of the letter name.

A total of 30 first-grade Korean ELs were screened three times during the year using early literacy measures from DIBELS. A sample of students was provided an empirically supported phonological awareness (PA) intervention to determine whether DIBELS measures were sensitive to growth caused by an intervention. Results suggest screening measures of phoneme segmentation fluency (phoneme segmentation fluency, PSF) were not predictive of reading performance at the middle and end of first grade. Measures of alphabetics (nonsense word fluency, NWF) were predictive of reading skills for this sample of first-grade Korean ELs. PSF and NWF were sensitive to change caused by an intervention, and appear to be able to be used to monitor the impact of a PA intervention.

Children ( N  = 157) were assessed on their letter writing automaticity, spelling, oral language, word reading, and attention in kindergarten. Then, they were assessed on writing in third grade using three writing tasks — one narrative and two expository prompts. Children's written compositions were evaluated in terms of writing quality (the extent to which ideas were developed and presented in an organized manner). Structural equation modeling showed that kindergarten oral language and lexical literacy skills (i.e., word reading and spelling) were independently predicted third grade narrative writing quality, and kindergarten literacy skill uniquely predicted third grade expository writing quality. In contrast, attention and letter writing automaticity were not independently related to writing quality in either narrative or expository genre.

RESULTS: In general, the statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences between genders. However, qualitatively, it was observed that girls were more successful than boys in all segmentation and phonemic synthesis tasks, which impact the analysis of smaller elements. CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistically significant differences were found between genders, it was verified that girls presented better phonemic awareness abilities."
1,2069528374,home literacy environment and the beginning of reading and spelling,2013,"frank niklas, wolfgang schneider",contemporary educational psychology,1,83,64,"Reading and writing are necessary prerequisites for a successful school career. Therefore it is important to identify precursor variables which predict these abilities early in order to identify children possibly at risk of developing reading or spelling difficulties. Relevant precursors include letter knowledge, phonological awareness (PA), vocabulary, and cognitive abilities. Moreover, also social aspects such as the socioeconomic status of the family (SES), the migration background and the “Home Literacy Environment” (HLE) are of importance. So far, only a few studies are available which analyse the early development of different possible explanatory factors simultaneously in the years before and after school enrolment. In particular, the relative impact of HLE on early and later linguistic competencies in a German context remains unclear. Thus, in our longitudinal study, covering the period from kindergarten to Grade 1, we focused on the role HLE plays in the development of language competencies of 921 German children, compared to the impact of several other important variables.

The results highlight the importance of HLE for the development of linguistic competencies also for a German context. HLE was not only a good predictor of early vocabulary and PA, but additionally directly influenced PA at the beginning of primary school. Moreover, HLE acted as a mediator between SES and migration background on the one hand and the precursors on the other hand. This finding indicates that research and policy should focus more on the learning environments in families to improve children’s achievement."

In this study, we found evidence of the importance of spoken phonology in the letter–sound learning of 89 deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH) preschoolers. Only DHH children with at least some ability to perceive speech were included in the study. DHH children were more likely to know letter sounds for which the corresponding letter name contains a phonological cue (e.g., d as opposed to h), a phenomenon robustly observed in hearing children (e.g., Treiman, Weatherston, & Berch, 1994). However, unlike the pattern observed in hearing children, DHH children benefited more from phonological cues that are at the end of letter names (e.g., m) rather than the beginning (e.g., b). DHH children’s letter-sound knowledge was strongly associated with phonological awareness—and phoneme-level skills in particular. Despite less differentiated phonological representations, DHH children seem to rely on similar processes to hearing children as they begin to acquire the alphabetic principle, with spoken phonology playing an important role."
1,2073964316,developing early literacy skills a meta analysis of alphabet learning and instruction,2010,"shayne b piasta, richard k wagner",reading research quarterly,1,140,109,"In the field of early literacy, alphabet knowledge refers to children’s familiarity with letter forms, names, and corresponding sounds, as measured by recognition, production, and writing tasks. Together, such alphabet knowledge represents an important component of emergent literacy (Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). Children’s knowledge of letter names and sounds is the best predictor of their later reading and spelling abilities (Hammill, 2004; Scarborough, 1998; Schatschneider, Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, & Foorman, 2004). Letter name and letter sound knowledge predict subsequent literacy skills independently of other important predictors including phonological awareness and oral language (Burgess & Lonigan, 1998; McBride-Chang, 1999; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994). Preschool and kindergarten students with poor knowledge of letter names and sounds are more likely to struggle with learning to read and be classified as having reading disabilities (Gallagher, Frith, & Snowling, 2000; O’Connor & Jenkins, 1999; Torppa, Poikkeus, Laakso, Eklund, & Lyytinen, 2006). These children tend to fall further behind their peers in reading acquisition, leading to gaps in spelling, reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension skills (Stanovich, 1986; Torgesen, 2002).

For these reasons, alphabet knowledge has become an important learning goal for young children. The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) recognizes development of the alphabetic principle as a goal for the preschool years and proficiency in letter discrimination, letter naming, and letter–sound correspondences are expected during the kindergarten year (NAEYC, 1998). Standards for Head Start (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services & Administration for Children and Families, 2003) require children to demonstrate awareness of letters as individual symbols and the capability to identify at least 10 letters by name. Both the Early Reading First and Reading First programs set explicit goals for increasing letter knowledge and letter–sound correspondences (U.S. Department of Education, 2002; 2003). Finally, many state curriculum frameworks, as required by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, include letter name learning, basic sound knowledge, and letter writing in their literacy standards for prekindergarten and kindergarten students (e.g., Florida Department of Education, n.d.; Massachusetts Department of Education, 2001).

Despite these initiatives, relatively little is known about the impact of early instruction on the development of alphabet knowledge. This fact is especially troublesome as large numbers of children continue to enter kindergarten knowing less than half of the letter names and fewer letter sounds (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services & Administration for Children and Families, 2005, 2006). Approaches to alphabet teaching vary greatly, as there has been disagreement about the appropriateness of early literacy instruction and about what constitutes effective instruction (Bredekamp, 1987; Dickinson, 2002; Elkind & Whitehurst, 2001; Foulin, 2005; Justice, Pence, Bowles, & Wiggins, 2006). The present study synthesized the research literature on the effects of alphabet instruction on both alphabet knowledge and other emergent literacy outcomes. We examined potential moderators of these effects, including factors related to sample and instructional characteristics. We also examined whether effect sizes were affected by publication bias or methodological issues related to study quality."

This study sought to answer this question as well as to examine the effects of adult verbal and nonverbal references to print on children's visual attention to print during storybook reading. Forty-four preschool-aged children participated in this study designed to determine the amount of visual attention children paid to print in 4 planned variations of storybook reading. Children's visual attention to print was examined when adults commented and questioned about print (verbal print condition) or pointed to and tracked the print (nonverbal print condition), relative to 2 comparison conditions (verbatim reading and verbal picture conditions). Results showed that children rarely look at print, with about 5%-6% of their fixations allocated to print in verbatim and verbal picture reading conditions. However, preschoolers' visual attention to print increases significantly when adults verbally and nonverbally reference print; both reading styles exerted similar effects. The authors conclude that explicit referencing of print is 1 way to increase young children's contacts with print during shared storybook reading."

We examined patterns of performance in phonological awareness, naming of letters, morphological awareness, and visual-spatial relations, in 5-year-old native speakers of Spanish (n = 43), Hebrew (n = 40), and Cantonese (n = 63) and the relations of these literacy related skills to concurrent word writing and word reading. The writing systems in these languages represent three major categories, i.e., alphabetic (Spanish), abjad (Hebrew), and morphosyllabic (Chinese). Phonological awareness, letter naming, and perception of visual-spatial relations differed across groups, whereas morphological awareness showed a similar level of attainment in all three languages. Stepwise regression analyses explaining writing and reading for each language separately revealed both commonalities and differences between languages. Phonological awareness assessed by initial syllable deletion contributed to writing and to reading in Cantonese and in Spanish. Phonological awareness assessed by final phoneme isolation explained reading in Hebrew, whereas final and initial phoneme isolation explained writing in Hebrew. Letter naming predicted both writing and reading in Spanish and in Hebrew, while perception of visual-spatial relations did so in Cantonese. At age 5, children’s metalinguistic knowledge and visual discrimination abilities are already attuned to the particular features of the writing system to which they are exposed."

Phonological awareness, letter knowledge, oral language (including sentence recall) and rapid automatised naming are acknowledged within-child predictors of literacy development. Separate research has identified family factors including socio-economic status, parents’ level of education and family history. However, both approaches have left unexplained significant amounts of variance in literacy outcomes. This longitudinal study sought to improve prospective classification accuracy for young children at risk of literacy failure by adding two new family measures (parents’ phonological awareness and parents’ perceived self-efficacy), and then combining the within-child and family factors.


Method 
Pre-literacy skills were measured in 102 four year olds (46 girls and 56 boys) at the beginning of Preschool, and then at the beginning and end of Kindergarten, when rapid automatised naming was also measured. Family factors data were collected at the beginning of Preschool, and children’s literacy outcomes were measured at the end of Year 1 (age 6–7 years).


Results 
Children from high-risk backgrounds showed poorer literacy outcomes than low-risk students, though three family factors (school socio-economic status, parents’ phonological awareness, and family history) typically accounted for less Year 1 variance than the within-child factors. Combining these family factors with the end of Kindergarten within-child factors provided the most accurate classification (i.e., sensitivity = .85; specificity = .90; overall correct = .88).


Implications 
Our approach would identify at-risk children for intervention before they began to fail. Moreover, it would be cost-effective because although few at-risk children would be missed, allocation of unnecessary educational resources would be minimised."

The 8-week (30 min/week) environmental print programme provided multisensory strategies for children to interact with environmental print by identifying letters and words, tracing letters with fingers, and writing letters. ANCOVAs were conducted with pre-test scores as covariates.

In the MyTeachingPartner project, 154 teachers were provided with materials to implement a supplemental classroom curriculum addressing six aspects of literacy and language development. The present study examines the degree of variability in three aspects of implementation fidelity – dosage, adherence, and quality of delivery – and whether these components of fidelity were associated with children's growth in language and literacy skills across the preschool year. Findings indicate that teachers reported using the curriculum fairly often (dosage) and that they were observed to generally follow curricular lesson plans (adherence). In contrast, the quality of delivery, defined as the use of evidence-based teacher–child interactions for teaching literacy and language, was much lower. Children in classrooms in which activities were observed to last for longer (dosage) and in which teachers exhibited higher quality of delivery of literacy lessons made significantly greater gains in early literacy skills across the preschool year. Also, teachers’ use of higher quality language interactions was associated with gains for children who did not speak English at home.

Historically, Chinese children have learned to read by learning to associate the visuo-graphic properties of Chinese characters with lexical meaning, typically through handwriting. In recent years, however, many Chinese children have learned to use electronic communication devices based on the pinyin input method, which associates phonemes and English letters with characters. When children use pinyin to key in letters, their spelling no longer depends on reproducing the visuo-graphic properties of characters that are indispensable to Chinese reading, and, thus, typing in pinyin may conflict with the traditional learning processes for written Chinese. We therefore tested character reading ability and pinyin use by primary school children in three Chinese cites: Beijing (n = 466), Guangzhou (n = 477), and Jining (n = 4,908). Children with severe reading difficulty are defined as those who were normal in nonverbal IQ but two grades (i.e., 2 y) behind in character-reading achievement. We found that the overall incidence rate of severe reading difficulty appears to be much higher than ever reported on Chinese reading. Crucially, we found that children’s reading scores were significantly negatively correlated with their use of the pinyin input method, suggesting that pinyin typing on e-devices hinders Chinese reading development. The Chinese language has survived the technological challenges of the digital era, but the benefits of communicating digitally may come with a cost in proficient learning of written Chinese."

Multiple measures were examined to determine whether they could predict comprehensive latent first- and second-grade reading outcomes and whether their predictive validity changed concurrent with reading development. CEMs of phonemic, alphabetic, and integrated tasks were given 3 times during the kindergarten year to 299 students. Structural equation modeling indicates that CEMs explained a significant amount of variance on first- (54%–63%) and second-grade (34%–41%) outcomes. The predictive validity of specific measures varied over the kindergarten year with sound and letter identification measures being predictive early and segmenting and word reading becoming important as reading abilities progressed.

This study examined the early literacy skills differences between 4 sociodemographic groups, namely, boys ineligible for free or reduced-price lunch (FRL), girls ineligible for FRL, boys eligible for FRL, and girls eligible for FRL. Data on kindergarteners (N = 462) were analysed using multiple-group confirmatory factory analysis. Early literacy skill differences between boys and girls are more nuanced than previously reported; subsidy status and gender interact. Both boys and girls from high-poverty households performed significantly lower than the girls from low-poverty households in alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness, and spelling. There were gender gaps, with a female advantage, among children from high-poverty households in alphabet knowledge and spelling and among children from low-poverty households in alphabet knowledge. These results highlight the importance of employing methodologically sound techniques to ascertain group differences in componential early literacy skills."

Participants (n=53) were assigned by random allocation to one of the two interventions. Each intervention was generally delivered three times per week for 13 weeks as part of a reading centre approach in Kindergarten classrooms with small groups of children. In the synthetic programme children showed, as predicted, significant (p<.05) improvement in CV and VC word blending and the articulation of final consonants. The children in the analytic phonics programme showed, as predicted, significant (p<.05) improvements in articulating shared rimes in words. These results suggest that synthetic and analytic programmes have qualitatively different effects on children's phonological development. These phonological differences are not however immediately reflected in any qualitative differences in the way children undertook word reading or nonword decoding."

Additionally, it has been theorized that reading skills develop incrementally. The present study examined the genetic and environmental influences on two developmental models representing these parallel ideas, generalizing the findings to explore the processes of reading development. Participants were drawn from the Florida Twin Project on Reading, with a total of 2370 pairs of twins’ representative of the state of Florida. Twins’ oral reading fluency scores from school progress monitoring records collected in the fall of grades 1 through 5 were used to model development. Results suggested that genetic influences on the development of reading are general, shared across the early school years, as well as novel, with new genetic influences introduced at each of the first three years of school. The shared environment estimates suggest a pattern of general influences only, suggesting environmental effects which are moderate and stable across development."

There is a growing body of research into pedagogical change to improve literacy outcomes and the implementation of schoolwide approaches to teaching and learning, particularly within the context of school improvement. This article ties together these two threads through the powerful stories of two primary schools that had undertaken a long-term school improvement project. The evidence of their explicit teaching of literacy is examined through investigation of the ‘teacher talk’ that occurs in classroom interactions and professional conversations. The way this talk reflects teachers’ shared pedagogical practices, their use of metalanguage for learning and students’ engagement is exemplified. It shows how, in each case, the pedagogical dialogue and literacy learning is mutually used by teachers and students in their literacy practices."

Children from low-SES and language minority homes have unique linguistic strengths, but many reach school age with lower levels of English language skill than do middle-class, monolingual children. Because early differences in English oral languageskill have consequences for academic achievement, low levels of English language skill constitute a deficit for children about to enter school in the United States. Declaring all developmental trajectories to be equally valid would not change the robust relation between English oral language skills and academic achievement and would not help children with poor English skills to be successful in school. Remedies aimed at supporting the development of the English skills required for academic success need not and should not entail devaluing or diminishing children’s other language skills."

Half of these children were randomly assigned to a project-based intervention condition where they received supplementary intervention in small groups until the end of their kindergarten year. The other half received whatever remedial services were available at their home schools and literacy skills development in both groups was tracked throughout kindergarten. All available at-risk children were again assessed at the beginning of first grade and dichotomized into a “continued-risk” group and a “no-longer-at-risk” group using a composite measure of basic word level skills. Normal reader controls were also identified using the same measure. Children in the continued-risk group received either project-based intervention (one-to-one tutoring 30 min daily) or school-based intervention throughout first grade. Intervention for project treatment children was discontinued at the end of first grade and literacy development in all groups was tracked until the end of third grade. The present study focused on literacy development in children who received only project-based kindergarten intervention or both (project-based) kindergarten and first grade intervention, relative to the normal reader controls. Of special interest was the question of whether measures of response to intervention would more effectively distinguish between continued-risk and no-longer-at-risk children than would kindergarten screening measures, measures of intelligence, or measures of reading-related cognitive abilities. Results indicated that the RTI measures more effectively and more consistently distinguished between these two groups than did the psychometric measures."

The sample consisted of 119 preschool children with language impairment. HLE was conceptualised as frequency of storybook reading and literacy teaching during book reading. Frequency of storybook reading was a unique predictor of print knowledge, which is consistent with research on children with typical language. Literacy teaching did not predict print knowledge, which diverges from research on children with typical language. No interactions between the HLE and child characteristics were significant, but language ability and print interest play a role in understanding individual differences in literacy development."

However, recent evidence suggests that orthographic information influences phonological processing in typical developing (TD) readers, but that this effect may be blunted in those with reading difficulty (RD), suggesting that the core deficit underlying reading difficulties may be a failure to integrate orthographic and phonological information. Twenty-six (13 TD and 13 RD) children between 8 and 13 years of age participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment designed to assess the role of phonemic awareness in cross-modal processing. Participants completed a rhyme judgment task for word pairs presented unimodally (auditory only) and cross-modally (auditory followed by visual). For typically developing children, correlations between elision and neural activation were found for the cross-modal but not unimodal task, whereas in children with RD, no correlation was found. The results suggest that elision taps both phonemic awareness and cross-modal integration in typically developing readers, and that these processes are decoupled in children with reading difficulty."

Aims: To examine the dimensionality of the construct of school readiness among children with language impairment (LI), as well as the extent to which these dimensions relate to children's end-of-kindergarten literacy skills.

Methods & Procedures: Participants were 136 preschool-aged children with LI. Children were assessed on measures of pre-literacy, social, and behavioural skills in preschool and reading and spelling in kindergarten.

Outcomes & Results: Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that school readiness for this sample of children with LI is best characterized as two dimensions: pre-literacy and socio-emotional. Of the two dimensions, pre-literacy readiness was predictive of children's future performance in reading and spelling.

Conclusions & Implications: The results further our theoretical understanding of the dimensions of school readiness, as well as our knowledge of how these skills are related among children with LI. Identifying domain-specific readiness skills that are predictive of kindergarten success can help to identify means of early assessment and targets for speech–language intervention."

However, the development of English language acquisition may be different for ELL students. The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive role of English letter naming fluency, initial sound fluency, and vocabulary skills at the time of kindergarten entry for first grade English oral reading fluency and to examine the variability in language and literacy skills of ELL students by their demographic characteristics. The data for this study came from the Progress Monitoring and Reporting Network (PMRN), and were collected from Florida's NA Reading First NA schools. Letter Naming Fluency, Initial Sound Fluency, and Oral Reading Fluency components of Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were used as measures. Hierarchical Linear Modeling was used to analyze the curvilinear growth of ELL students’ first grade oral reading fluency. The results of this study revealed that kindergarten English letter naming fluency was the best predictor and vocabulary skills were the second best predictor of oral reading fluency in the first grade, followed by initial sound fluency. On average, male ELL students compared to female ELL students, ELL students eligible for free or reduced price lunch eligibility (FRPL) compared to those not eligible for FRPL, and Hispanic ELL students compared to White ELL students read fewer words at the beginning of the first grade and showed a slower growth rate. English oral reading fluency scores of Asian ELL students were the highest."

This supplementary classroom instruction augmented existing literacy curriculum in a 71 primarily Spanish-speaking English Learners (EL) in grade one, many at-risk of reading difficulty. Vocab+ lessons drew from expository text, and words were revisited throughout the program. The PA only group received a previously validated phonological awareness and decoding instruction with no vocabulary instruction. The treatment group (vocab+) spent 30% of the intervention on PA and decoding. Students demonstrated expected gains in vocabulary, while maintaining gains in phonological decoding equivalent to those of the PA only group. This study demonstrates initial justification for dedicating limited instructional minutes to vocabulary building in early literacy interventions while still dedicating a small portion of time to phonological awareness and decoding. Extensive evidence supports the effectiveness of early phonological awareness (PA) and decoding"

Two research questions guided this work: (1) Do Spanish-speaking English language learners receiving ESL services in the fall of kindergarten demonstrate homogeneous early literacy skills, or are there distinct patterns of achievement across measures of phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, and orthography? and (2) if there are distinct profiles, to what extent do they predict literacy achievement at the end of kindergarten and the beginning of first grade? Using cluster analysis, the authors identified four distinct literacy profiles derived from fall kindergarten measures of phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, and phonetic spelling. These profiles were found to be associated with literacy outcomes in spring of kindergarten and fall of first grade. The two profiles that were associated with greater success on later measures of concept of word in text, letter sound knowledge, word reading, and spelling were the two that included stronger performance on orthographic skills (i.e., alphabet knowledge and phonetic spelling). These findings demonstrated that there is heterogeneity among Hispanic ESL students at kindergarten entry and suggested that literacy instruction must be differentiated from the very beginning in order to meet students’ individual needs. The findings also suggested that orthographic skills should be assessed and taught early on. While phonological awareness may be a necessary precursor to reading, phonological awareness in the absence of orthographic skills may not be sufficient."

Our analysis shows that ethnicity plays a role in shaping the children’s initial reading readiness and later growth, but the effects of languages spoken at home are not significant. Our analysis also demonstrates a persistent achievement gap between low- and high-socioeconomic status (SES) Asian groups. However, gender difference in terms of children’s reading development is not found to be significant.

We examined (a) the contribution of phonological awareness to facilitating letter-sound acquisition from letter names and (b) the probabilities of letter-sound acquisition as a function of letter characteristics (i.e., consonant-vowel letters, vowe-consonant letters, letters with no sound cues, and vowel letters). The results show that letter-name knowledge had a large impact on letter-sound acquisition. Phonological awareness had a larger effect on letter-sound knowledge when letter names were known than when letter names were unknown. Furthermore, students were more likely to know the sounds of consonant-vowel letters (e.g., b and d) than vowel-consonant letters (e.g., l and m) and letters with no sound cues (e.g., h and y) when the letter name was known and phonological awareness was accounted for.

Segmentation displayed the weakest correlation with reading and accounted for no statistical variance in reading beyond what was found in the blending test. It also failed to account for a substantial amount of variance in reading that is captured by the manipulation test.

First, visuo-hapticand visuo-graphomotor training improved letter-sound correspondence acquisition scores more than the other types of training,and this improvement persisted in the second post-test. A cross-modal transfer was revealed by the fact that scores increased afterblindfold haptic and graphomotor experiences. Moreover, performance on untrained letters also improved, suggesting an indirecteffect following the speciﬁc trained letters training.

However, evidence from children with dyslexia indicates that deficits in visual–verbal PAL are strongly linked to the verbal demands of the task. The primary aim of this study was to disassociate the role of modality and verbal demand in driving the PAL–reading relationship. To do so, we compared performance across four PAL mapping conditions: visual–verbal, verbal–verbal, visual–visual and verbal–visual. We reasoned that if crossmodal mapping demand accounts for the PAL–reading relationship, both visual–verbal PAL and verbal–visual PAL should exhibit significant relationships with reading ability. The results were incompatible with the crossmodal hypothesis. Only tasks requiring verbal output (visual–verbal PAL and verbal–verbal PAL) significantly correlated with reading ability. In addition, visual–verbal PAL and verbal–verbal PAL were well represented by a latent “verbal output PAL” factor. Structural equation modeling showed that this factor fully accounted for the PAL–reading relationship; visual–verbal PAL did not add anything to the prediction of reading above and beyond this latent factor. The results are interpreted according to an alternative verbal account of the PAL–reading relationship."

Children attended little to the print, took longer to first fixate print than illustrations, and labeled fewer letters than when presented with letters in isolation. After controlling for receptive vocabulary, regressions revealed that children knowing more letters were quicker to look at the featured letter on a page and spent more time looking at the featured letter, the word, and its first letter. Thus, alphabet books along with letter knowledge may facilitate entrance into the partial alphabetic stage of word recognition."

1,2152493077,visual constraints in written word recognition evidence from the optimal viewing position effect,2005,"marc brysbaert, tatjana a nazir",journal of research in reading,1,71,34,"In this paper we review the literature on visual constraints in written word processing. We notice that not all letters are equally visible to the reader. The letter that is most visible is the letter that is fixated. The visibility of the other letters depends on the distance between the letters and the fixation location, whether the letters are outer or inner letters of the word, and whether the letters lie to the left or to the right of the fixation location. Because of these three factors, word recognition depends on the viewing position. In languages read from left to right, the optimal viewing position is situated between the beginning and the middle of the word. This optimal viewing position is the result of an interplay of four variables: the distance between the viewing position and the farthest letter, the fact that the word beginning is usually more informative than the word end, the fact that during reading words have been recognised a lot of times after fixation on this letter position and the fact that stimuli in the right visual field have direct access to the left cerebral hemisphere. For languages read from right to left, the first three variables pull the optimal viewing position towards the right side of the word (which is the word beginning), but the fourth variable counteracts these forces to some extent. Therefore, the asymmetry of the optimum viewing-position curve is less clear in Hebrew and Arabic than in French and Dutch."

The results revealed that although both letter-name knowledge and phonological awareness made unique contributions to literacy skills (i.e., word reading, pseudoword reading, and spelling), letter-name knowledge played a more important role than phonological awareness in literacy acquisition in Korean. Letter-name knowledge explained appreciably greater amount of variance and had larger effect sizes in literacy skills. Furthermore, children with greater syllable, body (e.g., segmenting cat into ca-t), and phoneme awareness had higher levels of letter-name knowledge. In particular, children’s syllable awareness and body awareness were positively associated with their letter-name knowledge, even after controlling for children’s phoneme awareness. These results suggest that Korean children’s awareness of larger phonological units (i.e., syllable and body) in addition to phoneme awareness may mediate the relationship between letter-name knowledge and literacy acquisition in Korean, in contrast with previous findings in English that have demonstrated a positive relationship only between phoneme awareness and letter-name knowledge, and the hypothesis that phoneme awareness mediates the relationship between letter-name knowledge and literacy acquisition."

Finally, if a lowercase letter had a visual and phonological resemblance to other letters, students had a lower probability of identifying the letter correctly. Implications for instruction are discussed."
1,2164241130,french normative data on reading and related skills from evalec a new computerized battery of tests end grade 1 grade 2 grade 3 and grade 4,2005,"liliane sprengercharolles, pascale cole, daniele bechennec, agnes kipfferpiquard",european review of applied psychology revue europeenne de psychologie appliquee,1,70,108,"To set-up standardized norms on the development of reading and related skills in French, we have developed a new tool, EVALEC. The data were collected at the end of Grades 1–4 (about 100 children for each level). EVALEC includes four tests focused on written word processing (three reading aloud tests, one silent reading test); both accuracy scores and processing time (time latency and vocal response duration for the reading aloud tests) were recorded. EVALEC also includes tests of phonemic and syllabic awareness, phonological short-term memory, and rapid naming; the latter test is presented in non-reading and in reading contexts in order to compare the impact of the time constraint in both domains. We assessed the effects of regularity (regular vs. irregular words), graphemic length and graphemic complexity (regular words with only single letter graphemes vs. those with digraphs such as “ch” and those with contextual graphemes such as “g”) on the reading of high frequency words. We also compared the effect of graphemic length and graphemic complexity on regular word versus pseudoword reading as well as the effect of the length of the items (short vs. long items) on irregular word versus pseudoword reading. According to the ANOVAs, for word reading, the effects of sublexical factors appeared stronger for the youngest children, but regular words were always read better and faster than irregular words. However, these lexical factors did not have the same effect for words and pseudowords. Their impact, when positive, was greater for words (e.g. the graphemic length), while the negative effects were especially marked for pseudowords (e.g. the length of the items). Among the correlations, those between accuracy and latency time were never significant for the youngest children, thus suggesting that some beginning readers favored accuracy to the detriment of speed while others adopted the opposite strategy. Concerning the correlations between the reading and the reading-related tests, only the correlations between phonemic awareness and reading were significant and only with the youngest children. In addition, the correlations between the two rapid naming tests (reading and non-reading tests) were not significant most of the time. These data would allow researchers and speech therapists to assess the reading and reading-related skills of dyslexics as compared to average readers. © 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved."
1,2164775407,validity reliability and utility of the observation survey of early literacy achievement,2006,"carolyn a denton, dennis j ciancio, jack m fletcher",reading research quarterly,1,47,42,"This study evaluated the validity, reliability, and utility of five of the six subtests of Clay's (2002) Observation Survey of Early Literacy Achievement (OS), including Letter Identification, Word Reading, Writing Vocabulary, Hearing and Recording Sounds in Words, and Text Reading. In addition to a review of studies providing assessment of the reliability and validity of the OS, we analyzed (a) the concurrent validity of the OS subtests relative to other instruments with known psychometric properties, (b) their validity and accuracy as predictors of reading development in grade 1, and (c) interadministrator reliability for the Text Reading and Writing Vocabulary subtests. The score distributions of most of the OS subtests indicated inadequate floors and ceilings, suggesting that when the OS subtests are scored as recommended in the manual, they are not suitable for program evaluation. Analyses of predictive validity indicated that decisions based on the attainment of established benchmarks in OS Word Identification, Text Reading, and Writing Vocabulary would be valid for early screening purposes and to evaluate student outcomes, but more work needs to be done in setting benchmarks for these subtests. In addition to this evidence for predictive validity, there was evidence for concurrent validity of the OS. Interassessor reliability was high for both the Text Reading and Writing Vocabulary subtests in our sample. Our review of the characteristics and administration procedures of each subtest suggests cautions regarding the utility of some of the measures for diagnostic assessment and progress monitoring. Overall, with some limitations, the OS can be validly implemented to assess components of early reading development.

Este estudio evaluo la validez, confiabilidad y utilidad de cinco de los seis subtests del Informe de Observacion de la Alfabetizacion Temprana (OS) de Clay (2002). Los tests incluyen Identificacion de Letras, Lectura de Palabras, Vocabulario Escrito, Escuchar y Grabar Sonidos y Lectura de Textos. Ademas de revisar estudios que evaluan la confiabilidad y validez del OS, analizamos: (a) la validez concurrente de los subtests del OS en relacion a otros instrumentos de conocidas propiedades psicometricas, (b) la validez y precision como predictores del desarrollo lector en 1° Grado y (c) la validez inter-evaluador en los tests de Lectura de Textos y Vocabulario Escrito. Las distribuciones de los valores de la mayoria de los subtets de OS indicaron efectos techo y piso inadecuados, lo que sugiere que cuando los subtests de OS se computan como se recomienda en el manual, no son adecuados para la evaluacion. Los analisis de la validez predictiva indicaron que las decisiones basadas en alcanzar los estandares establecidos para Identificacion de Palabras, Lectura de Textos y Vocabulario Escrito serian validas solo en los procedimientos iniciales de evaluacion y al evaluar los resultados finales. No obstante se requiere mas trabajo para establecer los estandares de estos subtests. Ademas de evidencia sobre la validez predictiva, se hallo evidencia de la validez concurrente de OS. La confiabilidad inter-evaluador fue alta tanto para el subtest de Lectura de Textos como para el de Vocabulario Escrito. La revision de las caracteristicas y procedimientos de administracion de cada subtest sugiere tener cautela con respecto a la utilidad de algunas de estas medidas para evaluacion diagnostica y control del progreso. En sintesis, con ciertas limitaciones, el OS se puede implementar con validez para evaluar los componentes del desarrollo de la lectura inicial.

Diese Studie bewertete die Gultigkeit, Verlaslichkeit und Anwendung von funf der sechs Abstufungstests von Clay (2002), der Observationsstudie (OS) des fruhen Schreib- und Leseerfolgs, einschlieslich Buchstabenerkennung, Lesen von Wortern, Schreiben von Vokabeln, Zuhoren und Aufnehmen von Betonungen in Wortern und beim Lesen von Texten. In Erganzung zu einer Uberprufung der Studien, die eine Bewertung uber die Zuverlassigkeit und Validitat der OS liefern, analysierten wir (a) die ubereinstimmende Gultigkeit der OS Abstufungstests relativ zu anderen Mitteln mit bekannten psychometrischen Eigenschaften, (b) ihre Gultigkeit und Genauigkeit als Voraussage zur Leseentwicklung in der ersten Schulklasse, und (c) ihre inter-administrative Verlaslichkeit fur das Textlesen und das Schreiben von Vokabel-Abstufungstests. Die Auswertungen der erzielten Leistungen der meisten OS Abstufungstests zeigten unzureichende Tiefen- und Hohenschwingungen auf, was darauf schliesen last, vorausgesetzt die OS Abstufungstests werden wie im Anweisungshandbuch bewertet, das sie nicht zur Programmbewertung geeignet sind. Analysen von aussagekraftiger Gultigkeit zeigten auf, das Entscheidungen, die auf das Erreichen von festgelegten Markierungswerten der OS Worterkennung basierten, beim Textlesen und Schreiben von Vokabeln fur fruhzeitige Unterscheidungszwecke und zur Bewertung von Schulerergebnissen von Wert sein konnten, jedoch mus noch mehr Vorarbeit bei der Festsetzung von Markierungswerten fur die Abstufungstests erfolgen. In Erganzung zu dieser Tatsache uber eine vorhersagbare Gultigkeit gab es Anzeichen einer ubereinstimmenden Gultigkeit der OS. Die Zuverlassigkeit der Bewerter untereinander war sowohl beim Textlesen als auch beim Vokabelschreiben bei den Abstufungstests in unserem Musterbeispiel hoch. Unsere Uberprufung der Charakteristiken und administrativen Handhabungen jedes einzelnen Abstufungstests schlagt Vorsicht in der Anwendung einiger der Bewertungsmasstabe zur diagnostischen Einschatzung und bei der Fortschrittsuberwachung vor. Insgesamt, mit einigen Einschrankungen, kann OS stichhaltig zur Begutachtung von Komponenten der fruhen Leseentwicklung eingesetzt werden.

Cette etude a evalue la validite, la fidelite, et l'utilite de cinq des six sous-tests du Questionnaire d'Observation des resultats en debut de litteratie (QO) de Clay (2002), a savoir l'identification des lettres, la lecture de mots, le vocabulaire de l'ecriture, l'audition et l'enregistrement des sons des mots, et la lecture de texte. Outre un etat de la question des etudes relatives a la validite et a la validite du QO, nous avons analyse a) la validite concourante des sous-tests par rapport a d'autres instruments aux proprietes psychometriques connues, b) leur validite et leur pertinence predictive pour l'acquisition de la lecture en premiere annee, et c) la fidelite inter-administrateurs de l'epreuve pour les sous-tests de lecture de texte et de vocabulaire de l'ecriture. La distribution des scores de la plupart des sous-tests du QO a indique des effets inadequats de plancher et de plafond, ce qui suggere que quand les sous-tests sont calcules comme il est recommande dans le manuel, ils ne sont pas adaptes a l'evaluation du programme. Les analyses de la validite predictive ont indique que les decisions basees sur l'atteinte des seuils indiques dans le QO pour l'identification des lettres, la lecture de texte, et le vocabulaire de l'ecriture, peuvent etre valides pour effectuer un examen precoce ou pour evaluer les resultats de l'apprentissage, mais qu'il reste du travail a faire pour que des seuils puissent etre etablis pour ces sous-tests. Outre ces resultats relatifs a la validite predictive, on dispose de resultats relatifs a la validite concurrente du QO. La fidelite inter-evaluateurs est elevee tant pour les sous-tests de lecture de texte que de vocabulaire de l'ecriture dans notre echantillon. Notre examen des proprietes et des procedures d'administration de chaque sous-test incite a la prudence en ce qui concerne l'utilite de certaines mesures pour la realisation du diagnostic et le pilotage de la progression. De maniere generale, et dans certaines limites, le QO peut etre valide pour evaluer certaines composantes du debut de l'acquisition de la lecture."

1,2170612627,promoting early literacy via practicing invented spelling a comparison of different mediation routines,2013,"iris levin, dorit aram",reading research quarterly,1,12,50,"The present study compared the effects of different mediation routines provided to kindergartners from families of low socioeconomic status on the students' invented spelling attempts and on their gains obtained on spelling and other early literacy skills (letter naming, sounds of letters, word segmentation, and word decoding). The effects of the spelling mediation routines were assessed beyond the contribution of the students' self-regulation and baseline literacy levels. Participants (N = 197, mean age = 5.5 years) were randomly divided into four groups within each of 10 classrooms. Three groups underwent individual intervention sessions of inventing five words' spellings twice weekly for 16 weeks. Group 1 experienced process–product mediation, providing information both on the process of inventing spelling (sound-to-grapheme mapping) and on the product (naming the letters and spelling the word). Group 2 experienced product mediation only. Group 3 experienced spelling with no mediation. Group 4 (no intervention) experienced the regular kindergarten curriculum. Results indicate that the process–product mediation routine was most productive for all students, both in the short and long term, beyond their self-regulation and baseline early literacy levels. Students who started with higher self-regulation and poorer early literacy skills gained more from training. The results question the assumption, shared by previous studies, that promotion of invented spelling should be by providing students with one-step-up solutions to compare with those they produced, because the process–product mediation was most productive for students of a wide range of spelling levels.



本研究比较不同的干预教学对来自低社会经济地位家庭的幼稚园学生的学习成绩的影响。学习成绩包括学生的创造拼写的尝试,以及拼写能力与其他初期识字技能(字母名称,字母发音、单词音素分解、单词拼读解码等)方面所得到的改进。不同的拼字干预教学效能的评估,都是根据学生的自我调整能力和基线读写水平范围以外所得到的改进为凖。参加研究的学生来自10个教室(人数=197,平均年龄=5.5岁),他们被随机分为四组。其中三组在16周内每周两次接受个人干预教学,每次尝试创造5个单词的拼写。第一组学生接受学习过程与结果的干预,教学内容提供有关创造拼写过程的知识(发音与字素对应规则)和有关拼写学习结果的知识(读出字母名称和单字的拼写)。第二组只接受学习结果的干预教学。第三组没有接受干预教学,只经历拼写学习。第四组(无干预教学)只学习惯常的幼稚园课程学习。研究结果显示,学习过程与结果的干预教学,无论就短期和长期而言,对所有学生产生最大的成效,而这些成效均超越了学生的自我调整能力和基线读写水平范围以外。从训练中能获益较多的,是那些开始时有较高的自我调整能力但较低的早期读写能力的学生。由于学习过程与结果的干预教学,对广泛不同拼写水平的学生都能产生最大的成效,这些结果令人质疑以前的研究所赞同的假设,认为促进学生创造拼写是应该通过为他们提供一步向上的答案,好让他们用以比较自己创造的拼写。



Este estudio compara los efectos de diferentes rutinas de mediacion que se les dieron a estudiantes de jardin de ninos de familias de bajo nivel socioeconomico en cuanto a los intentos de dichos estudiantes de inventar ortografia y los avances logrados en la ortografia y otras habilidades tempranas de alfabetizacion (nombrar las letras, el sonido de las letras, los segmentos de las palabras, y el desciframiento de palabras). Los efectos de las rutinas de mediacion ortografica fueron evaluados mas alla de la contribucion de la regulacion propia y el nivel de base de alfabetizacion de los estudiantes. Los participantes (N = 197, edad media = 5.5 anos) fueron divididos al azar en cuatro grupos en cada una de 10 aulas. Tres de los grupos recibieron sesiones de intervencion individual para inventar la ortografia de cinco palabras dos veces por semana por 16 semanas. Al Grupo 1 se le dio mediacion de proceso-producto, dandoles informacion tanto del proceso de inventar ortografia (delineando del sonido al grafema) como el producto (nombrando las letras y deletreando la palabra). Al Grupo 2 solo se le dio mediacion del producto. Al Grupo 3 se le dio la ortografia sin mediacion. Al Grupo 4 (sin intervencion) se le dio el curso corriente. Los resultados indican que la rutina de mediacion proceso-producto fue la mas productiva para todos los estudiantes, tanto a corto como a largo plazo, mas alla de la regulacion propia y el nivel de base de alfabetizacion de los estudiantes. Los que empezaron con mayor regulacion propia y peor habilidad de temprana alfabetizacion fueron los que mas ventaja sacaron del entrenamiento. Los resultados ponen en tela de juicio la creencia, compartida por estudios anteriores, que fomentar la invencion de ortografia deberia hacerse dandoles a los estudiantes soluciones de un-paso-mas-alla para que lo puedan comparar con lo que han producido, porque la mediacion de proceso-producto era mas productiva para los estudiantes de una gama extensa de niveles de ortografia.



لقد قارنت هذه الدراسة التي بين يديك التأثيرات المختلفة لدى منهاج توسط توفر لأولاد حضانة من عائلات في الطبقة الاجتماعية المتدنية بصدد محاولات تهجئتهم المبدعة وكذلك تقدماتهم المحرزة في التهجئة وبعض المهارات التعلمية المبكرة (مثل تسمية الحروف الأبجدية، ومعرفة أصواتها، وتقسيم الكلمات، وفكها). وقد تم تقييم تأثيرات عمليات التوسط الهجائية ما بعد مستوي مساهمة التنظيم الذاتي لدى الأولاد وتعلمهم الأساسي. وانقسم المشتركون (عددهم = 197، معدل أعمارهم 5.5 سنوات) عشوائيا إلى أربع مجموعات في كل من الصفوف العشرة بحيث تم إجراء تدخلات انفرادية لثلاث مجموعات في جلسات أبدعوا فيها تهجئة خمس كلمات مرتين أسبوعيا لمدة 16 أسبوعا. وقد شهدت المجموعة الأولى توسط عملية-نتيجة وهذا وفر معلومات عن كل من عملية إبداع التهجئة (تطابق لفظي خطي) والنتيجة (معرفة أسماء الحروف وتهجيئتها). بينما سهدت المجموعة الثانية توسط النتيجة فقط لا غير. إنما شهدت المجموعة الثالثة التهجئة بدون التوسط. في حين استخدمت المجموعة الرابعة (المجموعة الضابطة) منهاج الروضة الدراسي المعتاد. وتشير النتائج إلى أن منهاج توسط العملية-النتيجة كان الأفيد بالنسبة إلى كل الأولاد سواء أكان في المدى القصير أم البعيد وقد تجاوز مستويات التعلم المبكر الأساسي وكذلك التنظيم الذاتي. والأولاد الذين بدأوا بدرجة أعلى في التنظيم الذاتي وبدرجة أقل في مهارات تعلمية حققوا تقدما تفوق غيرهم. تتحدى هذه النتائج الافتراض الذي توصل إليه بعض الأبحاث السابقة، أن تشجيع التهجئة المبدعة ينبغي أن يتم عن طريق توفير الأولاد حلول متدرجة كي يقارنوها بالتي أنتجوها، لأن توسط العملية-النتيجة كان الأفيد بالنبسة للأولاد الذين حظوا بأبعاد واسعة من مستويات التهجئة.

On a reparti de facon aleatoire les participants (N = 197, moyenne d’âge, 5.5 ans) en quatre groupes au sein de chacune des 10 classes. Trois groupes ont suivi des sessions d'intervention individuelle d'invention de l’ecriture de cinq mots a raison de deux fois par semaine pendant seize semaines. Le groupe 1 a suivi une mediation processus-produit, en recevant une information a la fois sur le processus d'invention de l’ecriture (planification pour aller du son au grapheme) et sur le produit (denomination des lettres et ecriture du mot). Le groupe 2 a suivi uniquement la mediation sur le produit. Le groupe 3 a ecrit sans mediation. Le groupe 4 (pas d'intervention) a suivi le programme scolaire habituel. Les resultats montrent que la demarche processus- produit donne les meilleurs resultats avec tous les eleves, a court et a long terme, au-dela de leur auto-regulation et de leur niveau de depart en langue ecrite. Les eleves qui ont commence avec un haut niveau de regulation et des competences limitees en langue ecrite sont ceux qui ont le plus beneficie de cette activite. Ces resultats mettent en question l'idee, que l'on trouve dans les etudes anterieures, selon laquelle pour progresser dans l’ecriture inventee il faut presenter aux enfants la reponse toute prete pour la comparer avec la leur, car la demarche processus-produit s'est revelee plus efficace chez les eleves ayant des niveaux d’ecriture tres divers."
1,2171036725,reading comprehension and its underlying components in second language learners a meta analysis of studies comparing first and second language learners,2014,"monica melbylervag, arne lervag",psychological bulletin,1,87,165,"We report a systematic meta-analytic review of studies comparing reading comprehension and its underlying components (language comprehension, decoding, and phonological awareness) in first- and second-language learners. The review included 82 studies, and 576 effect sizes were calculated for reading comprehension and underlying components. Key findings were that, compared to first-language learners, second-language learners display a medium-sized deficit in reading comprehension (pooled effect size d 0.62), a large deficit in language comprehension (pooled effect size d 1.12), but only small differences in phonological awareness (pooled effect size d ‐ 0.08) and decoding (pooled effect size d ‐ 0.12). A moderator analysis showed that characteristics related to the type of reading comprehension test reliably explained the variation in the differences in reading comprehension between first- and second-language learners. For language comprehension, studies of samples from low socioeconomic backgrounds and samples where only the first language was used at home generated the largest group differences in favor of first-language learners. Test characteristics and study origin reliably contributed to the variations between the studies of language comprehension. For decoding, Canadian studies showed group differences in favor of second-language learners, whereas the opposite was the case for U.S. studies. Regarding implications, unless specific decoding problems are detected, interventions that aim to ameliorate reading comprehension problems among second-language learners should focus on language comprehension skills."

Participants were 119 students from the provinces of Castellon and Valencia, who have been evaluated when 4 years old. The administered instrument was a spanish version of the subtests related to early writing of SHELL scale in which the child has to choose between some letters, the one he needs to write some words (his/her name, “sea”, “sun”, “whistle” and “sun”). Results of the exploratory factor analysis allow to identify two factors which differ in frequency of occurrence and complexity of words and letters that compose them. So, in the ""high exposure"" factor saturate more frequent and simple words and in the ""low exposure"" factor we can find less common words and letters whose learning is delayed because of their complexity component. Furthermore, analysis of the reliability of the test has highlighted a general Cronbach Alpha test of .72 (with oscillations between .56 and .97 in the different items). Therefore, we conclude not only that the scale has a good internal consistency, but also that it is possible to consider the spanish adaptation developed, as a reliable and robust assessment of the writing emergent skills."
1,2182041361,what does rapid naming tell us about dyslexia que nos cuenta el nombramiento rapido sobre la dislexia o que a nomeacao rapida nos diz sobre a dislexia,2011,susana araujo,NA,0,0,82,"This article summarizes some of the important findings from research evaluating the relationship between poor rapid naming and impaired reading performance. Substantial evidence shows that dyslexic readers have problems with rapid naming of visual items. Early research assumed that this was a consequence of phonological processing deficits, but recent findings suggest that non-phonological processes may lie at the root of the association between slow naming speed and poor reading. The hypothesis that rapid naming reflects an independent core deficit in dyslexia is supported by the main findings: (1) some dyslexics are characterized by rapid naming difficulties but intact phonological skills; (2) evidence for an independent association between rapid naming and reading competence in the dyslexic readers, when the effect of phonological skills was controlled; (3) rapid naming and phonological processing measures are not reliably correlated. Recent research also reveals greater predictive power of rapid naming, in particular the inter-item pause time, for high-frequency word reading compared to pseudoword reading in developmental dyslexia. Altogether, the results are more consistent with the view that a phonological component alone cannot account for the rapid naming performance in dyslexia. Rather, rapid naming problems may emerge from the inefficiencies in visual-orthographic processing as well as in phonological processing."

1,2185304764,predicting progress in early literacy skills,2009,kim a h cordewener,NA,0,0,39,"This study focused on predicting progress in letter reading, word reading, letter spelling, and word spelling in first grade for children with language and communication problems. A sample of 78 second-year kindergartners was followed until the end of first grade. With respect to predictors, linguistic, phonological, and orthographic skills were considered, but also reading and spelling level at an earlier point in time. To account for all possible kind of processes, three linear and one nonlinear regression models were used to accomplish the analyses. The best predictor of level of and progress in letter reading, word reading, letter spelling, and word spelling in first grade is the same skill at an earlier point in time. Although the pattern of progress in letter reading between kindergarten and first grade, letter spelling, and word spelling appears to be continuous, the pattern of progress in letter reading and word reading between the middle and the end of first grade is discontinuous. The results also indicate a Matthew effect for word reading only. Reading and spelling are fundamental and important skills in society and education. Education is based on the ability to read and spell, so failure in these areas will have large consequences for learning. For decades, researchers have looked into predictors of reading and spelling, to make early identification of problems in these areas possible. The majority of prediction studies on reading and spelling followed children from kindergarten into first or second grade. The general pattern of this research resulted in a coherent set of predictors for reading, namely, letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and rapid naming. This is shown in Table 1. It presents an overview of studies that have investigated the main predictors of early reading in normally developing children. Although research on predicting spelling ability is much rarer (Naucler, 2004), the general pattern of predictors of early spelling is similar to that of reading. Table 2 presents an overview of studies that have investigated the main predictors of early spelling in normally developing children, and the main predictors are again letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and working memory. The fact that letter knowledge is one of the best predictors of reading and spelling performance is not surprising. After all, reading and spelling in an alphabetical language requires the knowledge of all graphemes (i.e., letters or letter clusters) that represent the phonemes of the language. Less obvious is the role of phonological awareness for the prediction of literacy skills. Phonological awareness refers to the ability to recognize, discriminate, and manipulate the sounds of the language (e.g., Anthony & Francis, 2005). Phonological awareness is a broadly defined concept and the reviewed studies reveal that a large number of different tasks has been used to measure phonological Predicting Progress in Early Literacy Skills awareness. Adams (1990) identified five levels of phonemic awareness in which tasks can be classified. At the most basic level, the child only has to have ear for the sounds of words. This level includes performing rhyming tasks. For example, the child might be asked to tell which of the three words does not rhyme: ‘hat’, ‘cat’, ‘dog’. At the second level, the child has to be able to compare and contrast the sounds of words in rhyming and alliteration tasks. For example, the child might be asked to tell which of three words begins with a different sound: ‘dog’, ‘sun’, and ‘doll’. At the third level, the child is familiar with the notion that words can be divided into phonemes, and knows how the phonemes sound in isolation. Examples of tasks are blending phonemes or syllable-splitting. For phoneme blending, the child has to listen to the sounds and put them together to form a word. For example, the instructor might say ‘/c/-/a/-/t/’ and the child has to say ‘cat’. At the fourth level, the child has to be able to segment phonemes. For this task, the child has to say which sounds it hears in a particular word. For example, the instructor might say ‘dog’, and the child has to respond with ‘/d/-/o/-/g/’. At the final level, the child has to be able to manipulate phonemes, like adding, deleting or moving phonemes. For instance, a child might be asked to say ‘monkey’ without the ‘/k/’. Skills at the phoneme level (third, fourth, and fifth level) are better predictors of reading than onset-rhyming skills (first and second level; e.g., Hulme et al., 2002). Rapid naming is also a less obvious predictor and refers to the ability to retrieve phonological codes stored in long-term memory (Allor, 2002). The rapid-naming ability is measured by the amount of time a child needs to name stimuli, like digits, letters, colors or pictures. Rapid naming is associated with reading, since both skills require the child to learn arbitrary associations between symbols and sounds (Manis, Seidenberg, & Doi, 1999). Some other required abilities are also similar for rapid naming and reading, like visual-motor coordination, serial scanning of text, accessing word names and meanings rapidly from memory, and articulation. Working memory appears to be one of the best predictors for spelling, and to a lower extent for reading. However, recent studies have shown that this aspect of cognition appears to add to the understanding of both reading and spelling skills. Working memory is considered to span both the storage and processing of information. To be able to read, one has to keep track of the coupling of letters to phonemes in the right order, that is, from left to right with respect to its graphemes and from first to last with respect to its phonemes. If this process does not proceed properly, reading and spelling may be hampered. An important conclusion from the above is that the main predictors of early reading and spelling in normally developing children are all language-related skills: letter knowledge, phonological awareness, rapid naming, and working memory. Children who have deficits in this area are children with language and communication problems. These children are at risk for developing reading and spelling problems. In the Netherlands, these children are either attending a special-education school for language and"

Two hundred children, half at risk, have been assessed from birth to puberty on hundreds of measures. The aims were to identify measures of prediction of later reading difficulty and to instigate appropriate and earliest diagnosis and intervention. We can identify at-risk children from newborn electroencephalographic brain recordings (Guttorm et al., J Neural Transm 110:1059–1074, 2003). Predictors are also apparent from late-talking infants who have familial background of dyslexia (Lyytinen and Lyytinen, Appl Psycolinguistics 25:397–411, 2004). The earliest easy-to-use predictive measure to identify children who need help to avoid difficulties in learning to read is letter knowledge (Lyytinen et al., Merrill-Palmer Q 52:514–546, 2006). In response, a purpose-engineered computer game, GraphoGame™, provides an effective intervention tool (Lyytinen et al., Scand J Psychol 50:668–675, 2009). In doubling as a research instrument, GraphoGame provides bespoke intervention/reading instruction for typical/atypically developing children. Used extensively throughout Finland, GraphoGame is now crossing the developed and developing world to assist children, irrespective of the cause (environmental or genetic) of their failing to learn to read (Ojanen et al., Front Psychol 6(671):1–13, 2015)."

Cook, Doctor of Philosophy Utah State University, 2010 Major Professor: Dr. Lori A. Roggman Department: Family, Consumer, and Human Development Reading success has been linked to high school completion, future job success, and future generations of children who can read. Unfortunately, children who are unable to read on grade level by the end of first grade are at a great disadvantage and unlikely to catch up later. Without the ability to read and comprehend text, all aspects of schooling become progressively more difficult and the challenge of poor reading ability can be so difficult to overcome that many poor readers will not complete high school. For these reasons, it is important to identify early experiences in a child’s family environment that predict the early skills that are necessary for later reading and reading comprehension. The child’s family environment includes the quality of both the general home setting and specific kinds of parent-child interactions. The skills necessary for reading success include vocabulary, phonological skills, and other early literacy skills, but broader cognitive and regulatory skills may also be necessary."

The question of how to teach these abilities is an important issue for researchers and practitioners alike. In the present study, we explored the impact of handwriting learning on letter knowledge and reading. We compared three groups of schoolchildren from Quebec and France, who differed in the handwriting style they learned in first grade. In the manuscript group, pupils were exposed to only one type of allograph in reading and writing. In the cursive group, pupils learned to write in cursive, but encountered printed letters in books. In the mixed group, pupils learned to write in both cursive and manuscript. The results showed that the manuscript and mixed groups performed better than the cursive group on measurements of letter knowledge. The mixed group achieved the highest reading scores."

The children (N = 72) performed five phonological tasks and a vocabulary test, a letter knowledge test and a reading skills test twice; in the beginning, when knowing no letters, and at the end of the study. The results show that the children's performance in the different phonological tasks improved over a six-month period. Detecting word structure or blending phonemes were easier than producing rhymes or twisting. The children who had learned to recognize letters performed better in phonological tasks than the children who had not learned any letters, but children able to read precociously exceeded all. Our results appear to indicate that learning letters does not require previous PA ability but affects PA."

Our approach was to isolate components of saccadic planning, articulation, and lexical retrieval in 3 modified RAN tasks. We analyzed 2 samples of undergraduate readers (ages 17–27). We evaluated the incremental contributions of these components and found that saccadic planning to nonlinguistic stimuli alone explained roughly one third of the variance that conventional RAN tasks explained in eye movements registered during text reading for comprehension. We conclude that the well-established predictive role of RAN for reading performance is in part due to the individual ability to coordinate rapid sequential eye movements to visual nonlinguistic stimuli."

Dyslexia is associated with structural and functional alterations in various brain regions that support reading. Neuroimaging studies in infants and pre-reading children suggest that these alterations predate reading instruction and reading failure, supporting the hypothesis that variant function in dyslexia susceptibility genes lead to atypical neural migration and/or axonal growth during early, most likely in utero, brain development. Yet, dyslexia is typically not diagnosed until a child has failed to learn to read as expected (usually in second grade or later). There is emerging evidence that neuroimaging measures, when combined with key behavioral measures, can enhance the accuracy of identification of dyslexia risk in pre-reading children but its sensitivity, specificity, and cost-efficiency is still unclear. Early identification of dyslexia risk carries important implications for dyslexia remediation and the amelioration of the psychosocial consequences commonly associated with reading failure.

In this article, I study the impact of an intensive in-service teacher training program on reading skills offered to kindergarten teachers in France. The program modifies the lesson content and encourages teachers to adapt instruction to student needs by dividing the class according to initial achievement. While assessing impact is usually difficult due to the presence of ability bias and teacher selection, I show that in this context, a value-added model that controls for school and teacher characteristics constitutes a legitimate strategy to estimate the treatment effect. Results show that all students benefiting from the program progressed in reading skills at the end of the year. Besides, weaker students progressed faster on less-advanced competences (such as letter recognition), while stronger students improved their reading skills. This suggests that teachers adjusted content to students’ needs. Finally, a cost-effectiveness analysis reveals that the program is approximately three times more cost-effective than reducing class size in France."

The field has become one of the most vibrant areas of scientific activity in terms of the connections among scientific advances and theory, program design, policy, and classroom practices. But despite the potential links between research and evaluation on the one hand and program development, practices, and public policy on the other, there are too many key areas in which public policy and practice are not well aligned with the knowledge base. These misalignments, as well as a host of questions emerging from new areas of scientific development (e.g., connections between physiological or genetic processes and behavioral development) and practice-based realities (e.g., the need for focused, intensive, and effective professional development of teachers), point to areas in which new research is needed. The aim of this monograph is to provide an analysis of the research evidence in four major domains of work in early childhood education, identifying points at which evidence is not well aligned with public policy or practice, and a set of questions to guide the next wave of research in this rapidly growing field. Overall features of the preschool landscape, including those tightly regulated by policy (such as entry age or eligibility) and those more directly related to child outcomes (such as quality of classroom interactions), are stunningly variable across settings and across time. Reasonable evidence suggests that these features also vary as a function of family background factors. The resulting picture is one of too many children and families falling through too many cracks and seams at too many levels. Thus, even in a policy and program development environment in which early education is valued and prominent and recognition of the need to close gaps and seal seams is growing, the realities point to a fragile and vulnerable nonsystem through which many of our most fragile and vulnerable citizens pass. Demographic shifts will place tremendous pressure on early education and child care in the United States in the coming decades—a trend that is well under way in many states. The consequences for preschool program eligibility and enrollment, available slots, preparation and support of staff, and program resources such as curricula are enormous. It is abundantly evident that the features of the preschool landscape—connections among child care, preschool, and schools; links between families and the adults who teach their children; capacities of the ‘‘system’’ for fostering positive development in children who increasingly vary by race, culture, language, and economic background—will undergo tremendous strain. The pressures imposed on this context and these relationships by the sheer variability present in the children and families will itself be a considerable threat to the viability of the capacity of preschool to promote positive developmental change. Compelling evidence from well-controlled research shows that preschool programs have lasting positive effects on young children’s cognitive and social development. The evidence comes from studies of child care, Head Start, and public school programs using a wide range of research methods, including experiments. Lasting positive impacts have been found for large-scale public programs as well as for intensive programs implemented on a small scale, but even some of the intensive small-scale interventions were public school programs. Some evidence has shown negative effects on social behavior, but the negative effects have not been confirmed by experimental studies. Cost–benefit analyses have shown that"

One of the researcherswas the teacher of the two groups and taught the alphabet through pre-instruction presentation to the first experimental group, andthrough while-instruction to the second experimental group. By accomplishing the treatment, the post-test was given to both groups. The results of independet-samples t-test indicated that while-instruction method for teaching alphaebt was much more beneficial than pre-instruciton. Language teachers can benefit from this finding in their elementary classes."

An increased focus on emergent literacy skills—particularly print knowledge—might improve later reading outcomes. We analyzed longitudinal measures of print knowledge (i.e., alphabet knowledge and print-concept knowledge) for 35 preschoolers with ASD relative to a sample of 35 typically developing peers. Through multilevel growth curve analysis, we found that relative to their peers, children with ASD had comparable alphabet knowledge, lower print-concept knowledge, and acquired both skills at a similar rate. These findings suggest that children with ASD are unlikely to acquire print-concept knowledge commensurate to their peers without an increased emphasis on high-quality instruction that targets this skill."

PGMs were applied to interrupted time-series (ITS) data that arose within the context of a response-to-intervention (RtI) instructional framework. During the kindergarten year, multiple literacy assessments were conducted and supplemental instruction was initiated with struggling readers to promote the attainment of literacy benchmark goals. The use of PGMs provided analytic flexibility to specify a discontinuous learning function and test a number of within- and between-group model parameters related to the evaluation of program efficacy. Results revealed a statistically significant linear increment in student learning following the onset of the intervention. However, absolute and relative gains in literacy performance were more modest during the second half of the academic year. Key issues in applying PGMs wi..."

To investigate this issue three interventions were compared in 58 dyslexics in second grade (7 years on average), two targeting the temporal dynamics (timing) of either the auditory or visual pathways with a third reading intervention (control group) using linguistic word building. Visual pathway training in dyslexics to improve direction-discrimination of moving test patterns relative to a stationary background (figure/ground discrimination) significantly improved attention, reading fluency, both speed and comprehension, phonological processing, and both auditory and visual working memory relative to controls, whereas auditory training to improve phonological processing did not improve these academic skills significantly more than found for controls. This study supports the hypothesis that faulty timing in synchronizing the activity of magnocellular with parvocellular visual pathways is a fundamental cause of dyslexia, and argues against the assumption that reading deficiencies in dyslexia are caused by phonological deficits. This study demonstrates that visual movement direction-discrimination can be used to not only detect dyslexia early, but also for its successful treatment, so that reading problems do not prevent children from readily learning."

We identify several turning points in children’s learning to read and write isolated words and to produce written texts in Hebrew, taking into account linguistic and contextual factors that may play a role in individual differences in rate and level of children’s attainments in these domains. We suggest that children’s growing command of the notational and rhetorical characteristics of written language occur in parallel, as forerunners of the lengthy path that lies ahead of children before they master overall organization of texts."

This study describes a protocol for identifying students at risk for reading difficulty during the kindergarten year. 
Methods: The authors piloted a protocol that included two reading screening instruments, a teacher questionnaire, a parent questionnaire and an oral language screening tool. Kindergarten children in two divergent elementary schools were screened. 
Results: Fifty-nine percent of the children screened demonstrated at least one warning sign warranting follow-up. The authors also found agreement among the results obtained through the various screening tools. Results were provided to first grade teachers the following year so that skill deficits could be addressed. Repeat screening of the children showed gains in skill development for 64% of the children in the follow-up phase.
Conclusion: Children at risk for early reading difficulties can be identified as early as during the kindergarten year. Early identification allows teachers to employ instructional techniques and strategies in an effort to remediate deficits before children demonstrate greater lags in skill development. While early identification is important for all children, it may be an even greater advantage for children entering school with the additional risk factors of social and economic disadvantage."

However, little is known about the age at which such reading should start. The linguistic skills of 104 children were assessed shortly before school entry. Their parents were asked how old their children were when they first read to them and how often they had read to their children. Almost half of the study children were read to before they were 6 months old. The age at which children were first read to was closely associated with family characteristics such as socioeconomic status, the frequency with which children were read to as preschoolers, and with children’s linguistic and cognitive competencies.

Even when children with dyslexia have learned the letters and their corresponding speech sounds, letter-speech sound associations might still be less automatized compared to children with age-adequate literacy skills. In order to examine automaticity in letter-speech sound associations and to overcome some of the disadvantages associated with the frequently used visual-auditory oddball paradigm, we developed a novel electrophysiological letter-speech sound interference paradigm. This letter-speech sound interference paradigm was applied in a group of nine-year-old children with dyslexia (n=36) and a group of typically developing (TD) children of similar age (n=37). Participants had to indicate whether two letters look visually the same. In the incongruent condition (e.g. the letter pair A-a) there was a conflict between the visual information and the automatically activated phonological information; although the visual appearance of the two letters is different, they are both associated with the same speech sound. This conflict resulted in slower response times (RTs) in the incongruent than in the congruent (e.g. the letter pair A-e) condition. Furthermore, in the TD control group, the conflict resulted in fast and strong event-related potential (ERP) effects reflected in less negative N1 amplitudes and more positive conflict slow potentials (cSP) in the incongruent than in the congruent condition. However, the dyslexic group did not show any conflict-related ERP effects, implying that letter-speech sound associations are less automatized in this group. Furthermore, we examined general visual conflict processing in a control visual interference task, using false fonts. The conflict in this experiment was based purely on the visual similarity of the presented objects. Visual conflict resulted in slower RTs, less negative N2 amplitudes and more positive cSP in both groups. Thus, on a general, basic level, visual conflict processing does not seem to be affected in children with dyslexia."

NA NA NA Method NA We analyzed the degree to which three emergent-literacy skills (i.e., alphabet knowledge, print-concept knowledge, and phonological awareness) of 35 children ages three- to five-years-old with ASD predicted decoding and the degree to which associations differed from a comparison group of 73 TD children. We hypothesized that all emergent-literacy skills would predict later decoding for both groups of children and that autism status would moderate the association between print-concept knowledge and decoding. NA NA NA Results NA We found that phonological awareness was a statistically significant predictor of later decoding for children with ASD, but we did not find any evidence that ASD status moderated the relationships between emergent-literacy skills and decoding.

Expressive vocabulary was measured by using a standardized test; grapheme awareness was measured by asking children to identify one grapheme per trial presented amongst non-letter distractors. Two methods of shared book reading were investigated, literacy enrichment (additional books) and teacher training in shared book reading strategies, both without explicit letter instruction. Whereas positive effects of shared book reading on expressive vocabulary were evident in numerous previous studies, the impact of shared book reading on grapheme awareness has not yet been investigated. Both methods resulted in positive effects on children’s expressive vocabulary and grapheme awareness over a period of six months. Thus, early shared book reading may not only be considered to be a tool for promoting the development of expressive vocabulary, but also for implicit acquisition of grapheme awareness. The latter is considered an important precondition required for the explicit learning of grapheme-phoneme-conversion rules (letter knowledge)."

We predict that improving the speed and sensitivity of figure-ground movement discrimination (PATH to Reading neurotraining) remediating visual timing deficits in the dorsal stream, improves processing speed and reading fluency, and the executive control functions of attention and working memory in both dyslexic and normal students who had PATH neurotraining more than in those students who had no neurotraining. This prediction was evaluated by measuring whether dyslexic and normal students improved on standardized tests of cognitive skills following neurotraining exercises, more than following computer-based guided reading (Raz-Kids). The neurotraining used in this study, visually-based training designed to improve magnocellular function at both low and high levels in the dorsal stream, the input to the executive control networks coding working memory and attention, represents a paradigm shift from the phonologically-based treatment for dyslexia, which concentrates on high-level speech and reading areas. This randomized controlled-validation study was conducted by training the entire 2nd and 3rd grade classrooms (42 students) for 30 minutes twice a week before guided reading. Standardized tests were administered at the beginning and end of 12-weeks of intervention training to evaluate improvements in academic skills. Only movement-discrimination training remediated both low-level visual timing deficits and high-level cognitive functioning, including selective and sustained attention, reading fluency, and working memory for both dyslexic and normal students. Remediating visual timing deficits in the dorsal stream revealed the causal role of visual movement discrimination training in improving high-level cognitive functions such as attention, reading acquisition, and working memory. This study supports the hypothesis that faulty timing in synchronizing the activity of magnocellular with parvocellular visual pathways in the dorsal stream is a fundamental cause of dyslexia and being at-risk for reading problems in normal students, and argues against the assumption that reading deficiencies in dyslexia are caused by phonological or language deficits, requiring a paradigm shift from phonologically-based treatment of dyslexia to a visually-based treatment."

These cases demonstrate that providing a thorough evaluation of performance validity is an essential component of determining eligibility for academic accommodations in both clinical and higher education settings. At the same time, discounting failure on certain performance validity tests may be necessary to protect against false positive errors. In addition, empirically based test selection and interpretation has the potential to enhance the clinical confidence during differential diagnosis. Examining the internal consistency of a given neurocognitive profile provides valuable clinical information to determine both the credibility of the overall presentation and applying established diagnostic criteria. Although clinical research has yet to identify definitive markers of non-credible neurocognitive profiles, a multivariate approach to performance validity assessment that combines empirically validated indicators and sound clinical judgment can improve detection rates while simultaneously protecting against false positive errors."

The program modifies the lesson content and encourages teachers to adapt instruction to student needs by dividing the class according to initial achievement. While assessing impact is usually difficult due to the presence of ability bias and teacher selection, I show that in this context, a value-added model that controls for school and teacher characteristics constitutes a legitimate strategy to estimate the treatment effect. Results show that all students benefiting from the program progressed in reading skills at the end of the year. Besides, weaker students progressed faster on less-advanced competences (such as letter recognition), while stronger students improved their reading skills. This suggests that teachers adjusted content to students’ needs.

1,2734433312,distinguishing cause from effect many deficits associated with developmental dyslexia may be a consequence of reduced and suboptimal reading experience,2018,"falk huettig, thomas lachmann, alexandra reis, karl magnus petersson, karl magnus petersson",language cognition and neuroscience,1,15,201,"ABSTRACTThe cause of developmental dyslexia is still unknown despite decades of intense research. Many causal explanations have been proposed, based on the range of impairments displayed by affected individuals. Here we draw attention to the fact that many of these impairments are also shown by illiterate individuals who have not received any or very little reading instruction. We suggest that this fact may not be coincidental and that the performance differences of both illiterates and individuals with dyslexia compared to literate controls are, to a substantial extent, secondary consequences of either reduced or suboptimal reading experience or a combination of both. The search for the primary causes of reading impairments will make progress if the consequences of quantitative and qualitative differences in reading experience are better taken into account and not mistaken for the causes of reading disorders. We close by providing four recommendations for future research."

In the present study, we examined the relationship between word decoding ability and three different phonological skills; phonemic awareness, verbal short-term memory (V-STM), and rapid automatic naming (RAN) in 1007 Scandinavian third- and fifth-graders. In the first part of the study, we sought to investigate the influence of the three phonological skills on word decoding ability. Using multiple regression analysis, our result clearly demonstrated that phonemic awareness was the most powerful phonological skill explaining variance in word decoding ability among average decoders. Among children with poor decoding skills, however, RAN was the most important factor in Grade 3, whereas V-STM was the main contributor to decoding ability among children in Grade 5. In the second part of the research, we examined the relationship between poor phonological skills and word decoding ability. Interestingly, our result revealed that approximately one half of the children with phonological difficulties, still performed within the average range with regard to word decoding ability. However, our analyses confirmed earlier research concerning the severe word decoding difficulties children with both poor phonemic awareness and restricted V-STM, experience."

MI is commonly evaluated using multi-group structural equation modeling through a sequence of chi-square and chi-square-difference tests. However, under the conventional null hypothesis testing (NHT) one can never be confident enough to claim MI even when all test statistics are not significant. Equivalence testing (ET) has been recently proposed to replace NHT for studying MI. ET informs researchers a size of possible misspecification and allows them to claim that measurements are practically equivalent across groups if the size of misspecification is smaller than a tolerable value. Another recent advancement in studying MI is a projection-based method under which testing the cross-group equality of means of latent traits does not require the intercepts equal across groups. The purpose of this article is to introduce the key ideas of the two advancements in MI and present a newly developed R package equaltestMI for researchers to easily apply the two methods. A real data example is provided to illustrate the use of the package. It is advocated that researchers should always consider using the two methods whenever MI needs to be examined."

This study investigated the interrelations of growth in LNF and LSF across the kindergarten year and their unique roles in predicting later reading fluency. Piecewise parallel-process growth models indicated that although LNF and LSF were highly correlated at kindergarten entry, fall LNF status was positively predictive of LSF growth across the fall. Bidirectional effects were present, as initial LSF was also a positive predictor of LNF growth across the fall; however, its effects were not as strong as those of initial LNF on LSF growth. More importantly, both initial status and growth in LNF and LSF were uniquely predictive of first-grade reading fluency, indicat..."

Rapid automatized naming (RAN) and rapid alternating stimulus (RAS) are reliable predictors of reading outcome and involve the integration of different neural and cognitive processes required in a mature reading brain. Most studies examining the genetic basis of RAN and RAS have focused on pedigree-based analyses in samples of European descent, with limited representation of groups with Hispanic or African ancestry. In the present study, we conducted a multivariate genome-wide association analysis to identify shared genetic factors that contribute to performance across RAN Objects, RAN Letters, and RAS Letters/Numbers in a sample of Hispanic and African American youth. We then tested whether they also contribute to variance in reading fluency and word reading. Genome-wide significant, pleiotropic, effects across RAN Objects, RAN Letters, and RAS Letters/Numbers were observed for SNPs located on chromosome 10q23.31, which also showed significant association with reading fluency and word reading performance. Bioinformatic analysis of this region using extant epigenetic data from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium indicates functionality in the brain. Neuroimaging genetic analysis showed that rs1555839, the top associated SNP, was also associated with cortical volume in the right inferior parietal cortex, a region of the brain that processes numerical information and that is activated in reading disabled individuals performing reading tasks. This study provides support for a novel locus on chromosome 10q23.31 associated with RAN, RAS, and reading-related performance."

1,2767601436,multivariate summer school effects,2017,"keith zvoch, mark c robertson",studies in educational evaluation,1,0,67,Abstract NA NA The effect of assignment to and participation in summer school for a moderately at-risk sample of kindergarten students was examined with multivariate analytic methods. A multivariate analysis of variance applied to difference scores capturing the change in summer literacy outcomes revealed that kindergarten students randomly assigned to summer school outperformed their control group peers on a linear composite of early literacy indicators. The estimated group difference was greater when participation in summer school was distinguished from receipt of the summer program offer in analyses that explicitly adjusted for the proportion of students who failed to comply with their assignment. These results demonstrate that the nature and generalizability of the inference regarding program performance varies in relation to the intended and achieved design and the analytic model applied to data. Implications for the evaluation of summer school programs are discussed.

Children were tested before and after the intervention with different measures of letter knowledge. We showed a greater improvement in letter recognition following the visuomotor intervention, compared with the visual intervention. Results were mixed for letter handwriting for which we found higher scores on stroke direction and overall quality, but lower scores on fluency following whole body visuomotor teaching.

The dimensionality of decoding measures (i.e., phonological awareness and decoding fluency) and language measures (i.e., listening comprehension, vocabulary, and syntax) was examined with confirmatory factor analysis and related to a reading comprehension factor comprised of national and state tests. The resulting R2 was compared to the sum of the R2 of decoding-only and language-only models to obtain the unique and common variances explained by language and decoding. Across grades 1–10, most of the variance was explained by either the common variance between the decoding and language factors or the unique effect of the language factor.

1,2790453929,commentary brain behavior relations in reading and dyslexia implications of chinese results,2006,"charles a perfetti, li hai tan, wai ting siok",NA,0,0,24,"It is ironic that our recent report on the neural correlatesof Chinese dyslexia (Siok, Perfetti, Jin, & Tan, 2004) raisesa concern by Ziegler (2006) that this report could under-mine an agreed-upon conclusion favoring a phonologicaldeﬁcit as the cause of reading disability. Our past researchover 20 years in English (Perfetti, 1985) and Chinese (Per-fetti, Liu, & Tan, 2005; Pollatsek, Tan, & Rayner, 2000;Tan & Perfetti, 1998) has argued that phonological pro-cesses are intrinsic to word reading and universal acrosswriting systems, and we certainly have no reason to mini-mize the importance of these processes for understandingreading disability. We address Ziegler’s concern by makingtwo observations. (1) The Siok et al. evidence supporting arole for the left middle frontal gyrus (LMFG) instead ofthe left posterior temporoparietal regions found in alpha-betic research does not undermine the consensus on theuniversality of phonology. Instead this evidence shows thatthe implementation of phonology depends on language andwriting systems, a conclusion also reached through behav-ioral evidence (Perfetti et al., 2005). (2) The detailed neuralbasis of dyslexia remains an open question, rather thanaccepted wisdom.On the ﬁrst point, Siok et al. did not conclude that pho-nology plays no role in Chinese reading disability and Zie-gler’s critique recognizes this. Indeed, the evidence in favorof a phonological basis for dyslexia in alphabetic writinghas accumulated impressively over 20 years, from a timeat which the prevailing views emphasized visual problemsas the cause of dyslexia. This evidence comes from neuro-biological (Brunswick, McCrory, Price, Frith, & Frith,1999; Eden et al., 2004; Price & Mechelli, 2005; Richards,Aylward, & Berninger, 2006; Shaywitz et al., 1998; Templeet al., 2003), cognitive (Bruck, 1992; Schatschneider,Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, & Foorman, 2004; Stanovich& Siegel, 1994; Vellutino, Fletcher, Snowling, & Scanlon,2004), and genetic perspectives (Taipale et al., 2003). Themore biologically speciﬁc form of the phonological hypoth-esis is that dyslexia is universally associated with functionaldisruption of the left temporoparietal brain regions(Paulesu et al., 2001). It is this hypothesis that is falsiﬁedby Siok et al. (2004).To summarize brieﬂy, using homophone and lexicaldecision tasks, we found that reading diﬃculty in Chi-nese is associated not only with a weakness in mappingof a character’s orthography to pronunciation (as mea-sured by the homophone decision task), but also witha substandard connection between orthography andmeaning (as indexed by the lexical decision paradigm).Importantly, these two deﬁcits were characterized by dys-function of the left middle frontal gyrus. The left tempo-roparietal brain regions associated with disabled readingin English and other alphabets were not involved in thereading of Chinese children. Thus, either Chinese readingdisability does not have a phonological component orthe phonological component in Chinese does not involvethe left temporoparietal regions. Because the Siok et al.behavioral data showed weakness in phonological pro-cessing, the conclusion is that this weakness is associatedwith some other neural substrate. The left middle frontalgyrus, which was under activated in Chinese dyslexics, isa likely candidate.However, this is not the end of the story, but the begin-ning. The research goal becomes to understand the func-tion of the LMFG in reading. It is not obvious that theLMFG, whatever its more general role in cognitive func-"

It involves 134 items grouped into nine different tasks. We administered a pilot version of the measure to 677 students in 2014 and a final version to 968 students in 2015. We did not find evidence that code-related skills and oral language are distinct but correlated dimensions among preschoolers. Rather, a single general dimension of early literacy with task-related specific dimensions fit best. A benefit of our modeling approach is that we can examine the internal structure while also evaluating the difficulty and discrimination of individual items. Results suggest a stable ordering of items within tasks and that some Spanish letters are learned more easily..."

While behavioral literature has identified core cognitive characteristics of response, the distinction of reading versus executive cognitive contributions to response profiles remains unclear, due in part to the difficulty of segregating these constructs using behavioral outputs. In the current study we used functional neuroimaging to piece apart the mechanisms of how/whether executive and reading network relationships are predictive of intervention response. We found that readers who are responsive to intervention have more typical pre-intervention functional interactions between executive and reading systems compared to nonresponsive readers. These findings suggest that intervention response in dyslexia is influenced not only by domain-specific reading regions, but also by contributions from intervening domain-general networks. Our results make a significant gain in identifying predictive bio-markers of outcomes in dyslexia, and have important implications for the development of personalized clinical interventions."

However, despite evidence suggesting a protracted development of the dorsal visual stream, and a role of this pathway in neurodevelopmental disorders, V5/MT has not been characterized developmentally. Further, experiential factors such as reading acquisition may play a modulating role in any age-dependent changes. Here we used a coherent visual motion detection task to examine V5/MT activity and connectivity in typical participants in two studies: a Cross- Sectional Study comparing adults and children; and a Longitudinal Study of 2nd graders followed into 3rd grade. In the Cross-Sectional Study, a whole-brain analysis revealed no differences between the two groups, whereas a region of interest (ROI) approach identified greater activation in left (right trending) V5/MT in adults compared to children. However, when we measured V5/MT activation individually for each participant, children and adults showed no difference in the location or intensity of activation, although children did exhibit relatively larger extent of V5/MT activation bilaterally. There was also relatively greater functional connectivity in the children between left and right occipitotemporal cortex, including V5/MT. The Longitudinal Study revealed no changes in V5/MT activation for any measures of activation or functional connectivity from 2nd to 3rd grade. Finally, there was no evidence of an association between reading and V5/MT over time, nor predictive power of V5/MT activity for later reading.

Some children exhibit primary deficits in phonological processing, while others can exhibit deficits in oral language and executive functions that affect comprehension. This behavioral heterogeneity is problematic when missing data prevent the characterization of different reading profiles, which often occurs in retrospective data sharing initiatives without coordinated data collection. Here we show that reading profiles can be reliably identified based on Random Forest classification of incomplete behavioral datasets, after the missForest method is used to multiply impute missing values. Results from simulation analyses showed that reading profiles could be accurately classified across degrees of missingness (e.g., ~5% classification error for 30% missingness across the sample). The application of missForest to a real multi-site dataset (n = 924) showed that reading disability profiles significantly and consistently differed in reading and cognitive abilities for cases with and without missing data. The results of validation analyses indicated that the reading profiles (cases with and without missing data) exhibited significant differences for an independent set of behavioral variables that were not used to classify reading profiles. Together, the results show how multiple imputation can be applied to the classification of cases with missing data and can increase the integrity of results from multi-site open access datasets."

One treatment was designed to enhance motivation and learning by utilizing letters with letter sound characters integrated into the letter shapes (integrated mnemonics) and short narratives about the letter sound characters. In the treated control, plain letters and alphabet books were the foundation of instruction. There were no significant treatment effects on children’s perceptions of ability or desire/interest for school tasks (cross-domain) or letters (domain-specific). Children’s motivation increased significantly from pretest to posttest on three of four motivation measures including interest/desire for letters (domain-specific), and interest/desire and ability perceptions for school tasks (cross-domain). Effect sizes were dz = 0.50, dz = 0.34, and dz = 0.40, respectively. There were significant treatment effects in favor of integrated mnemonics on identifying letter sounds, identifying initial consonants, and blending. Treatment effect sizes were d = 1.31 for letter sounds, d = 0.61 for initial phoneme identification (ID), and d = 0.62 for blending phonemes. Self-reports of ability and desire/interest for school tasks and letters were correlated with learning. Results are interpreted as suggesting that (a) identifying features of instruction that enhance motivation may require stronger instructional elements, increased alignment between features of instruction and measures, and improved measures, (b) small differences in the nature of letter sound instruction matter for learning with superiority for instruction including letter characters integrated into letter forms and imaginary narratives, and (c) relationships among motivation, learning, and instruction are discernible in preschool children."

Each of these three phenomena is assessed using a longitudinal design spanning 15 years, from when children were 19 months old until they were 16 years old. Alongside measures for maternal vocabulary, a host of language and (early) reading measures, including vocabulary, early literacy development, oral narrative skill, and reading comprehension, were administered across eight time points to a sample of 58 children. Specific early language and reading skills were generally strongly correlated over time. Reading comprehension at age 12 was predicted by vocabulary at 19 months and emergent literacy at school entry. Vocabulary at 19 months of age predicted early literacy skills prior to school entry and reading comprehension at age 12 years, as did school entry literacy skills.

The participants were 1,016 children from Grades 2 to 5. They completed the five tasks of Tinfolec designed to assess the efficiency of the two procedures used to identify written words (the nonlexical route and the lexical orthographic route). We tested the reliability and validity of the new tool in a subsection of this sample. Correlational analyses provided evidence of the reliability and validity of Tinfolec. The results are consistent with the conventionally observed effect of lexical factors (length, consistency, and frequency) on written word processing. The results confirm the relevance of the proposed tasks. The study produced promising results and would allow practitioners to perform online assessments of reading skills."

Positive teacher-child relationships may be a link between transition practices and children’s school success. Here we examine whether teacher-child closeness mediates between kindergarten teachers’ use of transition practices and children’s academic and social growth during kindergarten. Data for this study came from the National Center for Early Development and Learning’s (NCEDL) Multi-State Study of Pre-Kindergarten. Children from 240 pre-K classrooms from six states were followed from pre-K to kindergarten. For this study, 730 children were included and were ethnically diverse: 40% White, 24% Black/African-American, and 26% Latinx. Three main findings emerged: (1) teacher-child closeness was predictive of children’s growth in multiple academic and behavioral outcomes in kindergarten; (2) transition practices were positively related to teachers’ perceptions of closeness with children in kindergarten; and (3) teacher-child closeness mediated the association between transition practices and children’s academic and behavioral outcomes.

I use a broad definition of school readiness that includes not only academic skills such as reading and math knowledge but also social and emotional skills and physical health. The most striking changes over time are large increases in children’s math and literacy proficiency. These gains were even larger among low-income and black children, suggesting that early income and race-based achievement gaps have narrowed over time. However, this chapter also documents some concerning trends over time. Children’s self-control and their approaches toward learning got worse across this period. Children were also more likely to be obese or overweight in 2010 than in 1998. These increases were largest among low-income and minority children, so racial/ethnic and income-based gaps in obesity have gotten larger. Taken together, the evidence suggests that children’s school readiness has improved in some ways and declined in others across the years considered. Implications for policy and practice are discussed."

Further research is required to examine which factors underpin the relationships between physical activity and academic performance. This systematic review aimed to identify, critically appraise, and synthesize findings of studies examining relationships between motor proficiency and academic performance in mathematics and reading in typically developing school-aged children and adolescents. A systematic search of electronic databases was performed to identify relevant studies. Fifty-five eligible articles were critically appraised and key data was extracted and synthesized. Findings support associations between several components of motor proficiency and academic performance in mathematics and reading. There was evidence that fine motor proficiency was significantly and positively associated with academic performance in mathematics and reading, particularly during the early years of school. Significant positive associations were also evident between academic performance and components of gross motor proficiency, specifically speed and agility, upper-limb coordination, and total gross motor scores. Preliminary evidence from a small number of experimental studies suggests motor skill interventions in primary school settings may have a positive impact on academic performance in mathematics and/or reading. Future research should include more robust study designs to explore more extensively the impact of motor skill interventions on academic performance."

Previous studies have examined this hypothesis with focus on a unidirectional relation from L1 to L2. In the present study, we examined bidirectional influences of literacy skills in multilingual contexts, and whether the nature of relations varied as a function of literacy instruction environment. To do so, we used longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial of a literacy intervention for children in Grades 1 and 2, learning to read in Kiswahili and English, two official languages in Kenya. Children in the treatment condition received explicit and systematic instruction on literacy (e.g., phonological awareness, phoneme–grapheme correspondences) in Kiswahili and English, whereas children in the control condition did not. Overall results supported bidirectionality of relations, such that children’s literacy skills in the two languages were reciprocally related over time. However, directionality of relations differed as a function of language and literacy instruction condition, such that the relation from English to Kiswahili was found across intervention conditions, but the relation from Kiswahili to English was found only among children who had received explicit instruction in Kiswahili reading. These results are discussed in light of theory and practice for language and literacy acquisition in multilingual contexts."

LS integration is related to left superior temporal cortex (STC) activity and its disruption was previously observed in dyslexia. Whether disruption in LS association is a cause of reading impairment or a consequence of decreased exposure to print remains unclear. Using fMRI we compared activation for letters, speech sounds and LS association in emerging readers with (FHD+, N=50) and without (FHD-, N=35) familial history of dyslexia, out of whom 17 developed dyslexia two years later. Despite having similar reading skills, FHD+ and FHD- groups showed opposite pattern of activation in left STC: In FHD- children activation was higher for incongruent compared to congruent, whereas in FHD+ it was higher for congruent LS pairs. Higher activation to congruent LS pairs was also characteristic of future dyslexia. The magnitude of incongruency effect in left STC was positively related to early reading skills, but only in FHD- children and (retrospectively) in typical readers. We show that alterations in brain activity during LS association can be detected at very early stages of reading acquisition, suggesting their causal involvement in later reading impairments. Increased response of left STC to incongruent LS pairs in FHD- group might reflect an early stage of automatizing LS associations, where the brain responds actively to conflicting pairs. The absence of such response in FHD+ children could lead to failures in suppressing incongruent information during reading acquisition, which could result in future reading problems."

In this longitudinal study with 65 German speaking children, the effects of literacy predictors on reading and spelling abilities were compared before and after school entry. Phonological awareness, letter sound knowledge, and rapid naming were assessed before and after school entry. In addition, reading and spelling abilities were assessed at the end of first grade. Path model analyses showed that letter sound knowledge before school entry predicted reading and spelling at the end of first grade, while rapid naming after school entry predicted reading but not spelling abilities. This study shows that the onset of schooling influences the predictability of early literacy predictors and indicates that with the onset of formal literacy education, predictors representing automaticity in serial processing increase in significance for reading abilities."

This study consists of two levels of literacy skills. Micro skills include phonological, orthographic processing skills, and word recognition. Macro skills comprise vocabulary knowledge and listening-/reading comprehension. Phonological and orthographic processing skills in L2 played important roles in L2 word recognition. L2 word recognition made a mediated contribution to L2 reading comprehension, while L2 vocabulary knowledge had a direct relationship with L2 listening comprehension and L2 reading comprehension. These findings suggest that sufficient phonological awareness and orthographic processing skill are important for successful English word recognition. Additionally improvement in L2 vocabulary knowledge along with L2 word recognition is significant for effective L2 listening-/reading comprehension."

A report that typewriting may hinder Chinese children’s reading development has sparked substantial concern about whether typing on electronic devices would increase the rate of reading disorders, wherein children used a pronunciation-based input system that associates alphabet letters with phonemes in standard Chinese (Putonghua) and may conflict with the traditional visuomotor-based learning processes for written Chinese. If orthographic-based input methods that require good awareness of the orthographic structure of characters are used, different outcomes might be observed. This study examined the impact of participants’ experience in different typewriting methods on the literacy abilities of fluent Chinese-English bilingual readers. We found that orthographic-based typewriting measures correlated positively with Chinese reading measures, whereas pronunciation-based typewriting measures did not correlate with Chinese reading measures but correlated positively with English reading and spelling performance. Orthographic-based typewriters also performed better than pronunciation-based typewriters in Chinese reading and dictation when their age, typewriting skills and pre-University language ability were statistically controlled. Our findings based on two contrastive writing systems suggest that typewriting methods that tally with the learning principles of a writing system should be used to promote and preserve literacy skills in the digital era."

In this longitudinal study, we asked whether properties of white matter pathways at the onset of learning to read would be associated with reading abilities at older ages. Children (N = 37) with a wide range of reading abilities completed standardized measures of language and phonological awareness and diffusion MRI at age 6 years. Mean tract-fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted from reading-related pathways. At age 8, the same children were re-assessed using a standardized reading measure. Using linear regressions, we examined the contribution of tract-FA at age 6 to reading outcome at age 8, beyond known demographic and pre-literacy predictors of reading. Tract-FA of the left arcuate, left and right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and left inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP) made unique contributions to reading outcome after consideration of sex and family history of reading delays. Tract-FA of the left and right SLF and left ICP made unique contributions to reading outcome after the addition of pre-literacy skills. Thus, cerebellar and bilateral cortical pathways represented a network associated with subsequent reading abilities. Early white matter properties may be associated with other neuropsychological functions that predict reading or may influence reading development, independent of reading-related abilities. Tract FA at early stages of learning to read may serve as a biomarker of later reading abilities."

To calculate the potential effects of such interventions, treatment-effects estimators with nearest neighbor matching were used. In Study 1 with policy intervention (N = 1095), children in experimental group (Exp) were assigned to small classes (12 pupils) and others in control group (Cont) to normal-sized classes (20–25 pupils). At the end of Grade 1, the effect sizes in favor of Exp were .14 and .22 in word reading and spelling. In Study 2 with educational interventions (N = 2803), children in Exp benefit from an evidence-based practice, i.e. a code-focused intervention (phonology, letter knowledge, decoding and fluency) developed by the Association Agir pour l'Ecole (Act for School) and conducted by teachers in small groups for children with low performance at the beginning of Grade 1. The effect sizes of interventions in various literacy skills were from .12 to .32. This set of results obtained in France is in accordance with those described in other countries. To conclude, a double intervention with small classes and targeted educational approaches could be one of the best ways of reducing inequalities during learning to read."

To fill this gap, we investigated 368 first graders’ oral and silent reading using eye-tracking technology at the beginning and end of the school year. Oral reading took a longer time (greater rereading times and refixations) than silent reading, but showed greater development (greater reduction in rereading times and fixations) from the beginning to the end of the year. The relation of eye-movement behaviors to reading proficiency was such that, for example, less rereading time was positively related to reading proficiency, and the relation was stronger in oral reading than in silent reading. Moreover, the nature of relations between eye movements and reading skill varied as a function of the child’s reading proficiency such that the relations were weaker for poor readers, particularly at the beginning of the year. The relations between eye movements and reading proficiency stabilized in the spring for children whose reading skill was 0.30 quantile and above, but weaker relations remained for readers below 0.30 quantile. These findings suggest the importance of examining eye-movement behaviors in both oral and silent reading modes and their developmental relations to reading proficiency."

Unfortunately, while low sensitivity leads to under-identification of at-risk children, low specificity can lead to over-identification, resulting in inaccurate allocation of limited educational resources. The present study focused on children identified as at-risk in kindergarten who do not subsequently develop dyslexia to specify factors associated with better reading outcomes among at-risk children. Early screening was conducted in kindergarten and a subset of children was tracked longitudinally until second grade. Potential protective factors were evaluated at cognitive-linguistic, environmental, and neural levels. Relative to at-risk kindergarteners who subsequently developed dyslexia, those who did not were characterized by significantly higher socioeconomic status (SES), speech production accuracy, and microstructure of the posterior right-hemispheric superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). A positive association between microstructure of the right SLF and subsequent decoding skills was found to be specific to at-risk children and not observed among typical controls. Among at-risk children, several kindergarten-age factors were found to significantly contribute to the prediction of subsequent decoding skills: microstructure of the posterior right SLF, age, gender, SES, and phonological awareness. These findings suggest that putative compensatory mechanisms are already present by the start of kindergarten. The right SLF, in conjunction with the cognitive-linguistic and socioeconomic factors identified, may play an important role in facilitating reading development among at-risk children. This study has important implications for approaches to early screening, and assessment strategies for at-risk children."

Some children exhibit primary deficits in phonological processing, while others can exhibit deficits in oral language and executive functions that affect comprehension. This behavioral heterogeneity is problematic when missing data prevent the characterization of different reading profiles, which often occurs in retrospective data sharing initiatives without coordinated data collection. Here we show that reading profiles can be reliably identified based on Random Forest classification of incomplete behavioral datasets, after the missForest method is used to multiply impute missing values. Results from simulation analyses showed that reading profiles could be accurately classified across degrees of missingness (e.g., ~5% classification error for 30% missingness across the sample). The application of missForest to a real multi-site dataset (n = 924) showed that reading disability profiles significantly and consistently differed in reading and cognitive abilities for cases with and without missing data. The results of validation analyses indicated that the reading profiles (cases with and without missing data) exhibited significant differences for an independent set of behavioral variables that were not used to classify reading profiles. Together, the results show how multiple imputation can be applied to the classification of cases with missing data and can increase the integrity of results from multi-site open access datasets."

This lack of research creates challenges for practitioners who are working with ELLs in schools. These professionals must make decisions about placements, interventions, and accommodations without having a clear indication of whether ELLs struggle with reading because of lack of English language exposure or a neurological condition, such as dyslexia. The present study explored several known correlates of reading in native English speakers, including Phonological Awareness, Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN), and Processing Speed as predictors of basic reading skills in Spanish-speaking ELLs. The findings suggested that most tasks of Phonological Awareness and RAN were highly correlated to basic reading skills in Spanish-speaking ELLs and that these measures should be part of a dyslexia assessment with this population. When Phonological Awareness and RAN tasks as well as other demographic factors were controlled for, performance on Processing Speed tasks was inconsistently correlated to basic reading skills and was not a significant predictor of reading."

Our results highlight a transversal and longitudinal relation between rhythm sensitivity and letter name knowledge in pre-reading children. Moreover, they show that children’s rhythm sensitivity predicts a significant part of the variance of their N170 response one year later, highlighting the potential of rhythm tasks to predict future orthographic sensitivity in pre-reading stages. Interestingly, the relation between rhythmic skills and print sensitivity was not mediated by the children’s phonological short-term memory.

The current study examined how visual perception and attention networks influence naming speed, and analyzed the relationship between visual perception and attention networks. The total number of participants was 163 Thai preschool children between the ages of five and seven years selected through multistage random sampling. Visual perception, attention networks, and naming speed were assessed using the Developmental Test of Visual Perception 3 (DTVP-3), Attention Network Task (ANT), and Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN), respectively. Structural equation modeling was used to test naming speed hypotheses. The hypothesis of a causal model was supported by the evidence generated by this study. A direct positive association between both visual perception and attention networks to naming speed was observed. Compared with attention networks, visual perception had a higher significant effect on naming speed performance. Consequently, children who have higher visual perception are more likely to demonstrate a better naming speed performance. These results indicate that visual perception is strongly urged to naming speed, as doing so can help predict children's reading readiness before they start learning to read."

However, few have simultaneously examined development of skills in both languages for children in preschool. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the language and literacy skills among Spanish–English DLL preschoolers and to directly compare change over time in language and literacy skills in both Spanish and English in secondary data analyses of three studies of DLL children. Hierarchical linear model analyses compared acquisition of language skills in English and Spanish in three studies. Using language and time as nesting factors, these models allow for direct contrast of level and rate of acquisition across languages. Results showed that Spanish-English DLL children made gains in their English abilities while being exposed to Spanish at home. Also, gains in English vocabulary skills were observed when children’s Spanish skills were higher than the English skills. Gains in children’s Spanish language abilities were not realized and children’s English language abilities did not appear to support children’s Spanish skills. Cross-language relations were observed in literacy."

1,2987211171,neural representations of phonology in temporal cortex scaffold longitudinal reading gains in 5 to 7 year old children,2019,"jin wang, marc f joanisse, james r booth",neuroimage,1,0,65,"Abstract NA NA The objective of this study was to investigate whether phonological processes measured through brain activation are crucial for the development of reading skill (i.e. scaffolding hypothesis) and/or whether learning to read words fine-tunes phonology in the brain (i.e. refinement hypothesis). We specifically looked at how different grain sizes in two brain regions implicated in phonological processing played a role in this bidirectional relation. According to the dual-stream model of speech processing and previous empirical studies, the posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) appears to be a perceptual region associated with phonological representations, whereas the dorsal inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) appears to be an articulatory region that accesses phonological representations in STG during more difficult tasks. 36 children completed a reading test outside the scanner and an auditory phonological task which included both small (i.e. onset) and large (i.e. rhyme) grain size conditions inside the scanner when they were 5.5–6.5 years old (Time 1) and once again approximately 1.5 years later (Time 2). To study the scaffolding hypothesis, a regression analysis was carried out by entering brain activation in either STG or IFG for either small (onset > perceptual) or large (rhyme > perceptual) grain size phonological processing at T1 as the predictors and reading skill at T2 as the dependent measure, with several covariates of no interest included. To study the refinement hypothesis, the regression analysis included reading skill at T1 as the predictor and brain activation in either STG or IFG for either small or large grain size phonological processing at T2 as the dependent measures, with several covariates of no interest included. We found that only posterior STG, regardless of grain size, was predictive of reading gains. Parallel models with only behavioral accuracy were not significant. Taken together, our results suggest that the representational quality of phonology in temporal cortex is crucial for reading development. Moreover, our study provides neural evidence supporting the scaffolding hypothesis, suggesting that brain measures of phonology could be helpful in early identification of reading difficulties."

(Jyvaskyla Studies in Education, Psychology and Social Research ISSN 0075-4625; 523) ISBN 978-951-39-6187-9 (nid.) ISBN 978-951-39-6188-6 (PDF) This research evaluated the ability to retrieve and fluently name serially presented familiar items, known as rapid automatized naming (RAN), as an underlying skill in reading disability and its role in a reading fluency intervention. The specificity of RAN on reading was examined in two studies among children with learning difficulties. These two studies showed that RAN was most strongly related to reading disabilities (RD), and less clearly related to math or attention deficits. This was especially true when RD was defined as reading speed or fluency. The association between RAN and RD was also examined within the framework of the double-deficit hypothesis (DDH), in which RAN is assumed to contribute independently to RD along with phonological awareness. The results among children with learning difficulties supported the DDH in that RAN was not related to phonological awareness but had a unique connection with reading fluency and speed. Children with double-deficit performed poorer in reading and spelling skills compared to the groups with a single deficit or controls. The reading fluency intervention, conducted among children with poor reading skill, showed significant effects on the repeated recognition of sublexical units (syllables). Moreover, a wordlevel transfer effect, which was also the strongest syllable-level intervention effect, was found for infrequent syllables. Reading fluency gains were greatest for the children with the lowest pre-intervention reading skills. The results showed that although RAN was associated with initial reading speed, it did not have an effect on the intervention gains. These studies strengthen the role of RAN as an independent skill underlying reading disabilities in a transparent language (Finnish) where reading disabilities are most strongly manifested as dysfluent reading. While comorbid learning problems were common and should be acknowledged in the assessment and intervention of reading, the slow naming speed found here indicated deficits specific to reading fluency. Despite the persistent nature of naming and reading fluency deficits, reading fluency does not seem to be resistant to intervention even when accompanied with naming speed deficits."

Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the neural overlap across different RAN tasks. Fifteen university students were assessed on RAN digits, letters, and objects using functional mag- netic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results showed a common neural pattern that included regions related to motor planning (e.g., cerebellum), semantic access (middle temporal gyrus), articulation (supplementary motor association, motor/pre-motor, anterior cingulate cortex), and grapheme-phoneme mapping (ven- tral supramarginal gyrus). However, RAN digits and letters showed many unique regions of activation over and above RAN objects particularly in semantic and articulatory regions, including precuneus, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, nucleus accumbens and thalamus. The only region unique to RAN objects included bilateral fusiform, a region commonly implicated in object processing. Overall, our results provide the first neural evidence for a stronger relationship between RAN letters and digits than when either task is compared to RAN objects."

1,1600705343,early literacy development in mandarin speaking children the role of phonological awareness rapid naming and spoken language skills,2012,lili yeh,NA,0,0,50,"In Taiwan, many children grow up in a bilingual environment, namely Mandarin and Taiwanese. They learn Zhuyin Fuhao – a semi-syllabic transparent orthography – at the beginning of the first grade before learning traditional Chinese characters. However little is known about the acquisition of literacy in this complex context, especially about the role of phonological awareness (PA), rapid automatized naming (RAN) and other spoken language skills. This longitudinal study is the first systematic attempt to investigate the trajectory of literacy acquisition in Mandarin-speaking children and the impact of instruction in both Zhuyin Fuhao and character. 

The study was carried out in Taipei. A sample of 92 children were tested in their first grade (mean age of 6;7), and then followed up a year later in their second grade. A comprehensive PA battery was designed to measure implicit and explicit PA of syllables, onset-rime, phonemes and tones. RAN, spoken language skills and literacy skills, including reading accuracy and comprehension in Zhuyin Fuhao and character were also measured, alongside non-verbal intelligence and children’s home languages.

It was found that the role of PA in early literacy development of Mandarin-speaking children in Taiwan varies as a function of the orthography system. PA was closely linked to ZF-related tasks and reading comprehension, but not character reading where it had no predictive role. On the other hand, graphological RAN was found to be a good predictor of reading performance in both scripts, both concurrently and longitudinally. Additionally, non-graphological RAN had a role in predicting lexical-related literacy skills. Lastly, all spoken language skills, except semantic fluency, were significantly associated with reading comprehension indicating that oral language competence contributes major variances in reading comprehension. Moreover, vocabulary and auditory memory were associated longitudinally with many CH-related tasks. However, the variance of ZF word reading or spelling could not be explained by any spoken language skills. Investigation of children with atypical development revealed that children with reading difficulties performed less well on RAN and PA tasks while children with speech difficulty performed less well on sub-syllabic PA, Zhuyin Fuhao literacy tasks and character recognition, but no differently to their peers on RAN and character reading accuracy and character knowledge in radical form or position. The theoretical, methodological and practical implications of these findings are discussed."

Functional imaging studies have shown that pause and articulation times in continuous speech are normally associated with different brain regions, but knowledge about such association in dementia is lacking. We therefore tested the hypothesis that perfusion deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not only associated with slower processing, but also with these speech measures. Using regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements during the performance of a continuous colour and form-naming task, we found that naming speed was substantially slower in AD patients than in controls. This slower naming was exclusively determined by an increase in mean pause time, and only to a limited extent by articulation time. The increased pause time was uniquely associated with temporo-parietal rCBF reductions of the patients, while articulation was not. By contrast, the rCBF of healthy elderly control subjects was consistently accompanied by substantially shorter articulation and pause times, although the naming measures were not statistically associated with rCBF. These findings suggest that pause time (in contrast to articulation time) may serve as a sensitive measure in the assessment of information processing speed deficits in dementia, by virtue of its close association with brain pathology."

Abstract
THE RAPID AUTOMATIZED NAMING TEST: ITS HISTORY AND RELEVANCY IN THE READING PROCESS The importance of the reading process and which are the components that involve has generated numerous developments and research worldwide. The aim of this theoretical research is to examine the origins and history of Rapid Automatized Naming Test, along with its consequent developments. The speed of access to the lexical label makes an unique contribution to reading beyond the other components that are involved. And it is of importance to note that this tool has proven to be useful not only as a potential predictor of reading difficulties, but also as discriminating between good and poor readers. The research results refer mostly opaque languages, but there are also few studies about transparent language and how it works there the speed of access to the lexical label in reading. Consequently, this test would be essential at the moment if intervening at an early stage of what could be potential reading difficulties in children, for which it would be necessary to do an adaptation of the same one along with the development of local standards.

Thirty university students with dyslexia and 32 chronological-age controls were assessed on RAN Digits and Colors as well as on two versions of RAN Letters and Objects (one with five items repeated 16 times and one with 20 items repeated four times). In addition, participants were tested on discrete letter and object naming, phonological awareness, orthographic knowledge, and speed of processing, and the RAN Letters and Objects total times were partitioned into pause times and articulation times. Results showed first that the dyslexia group was slower than the control group on all RAN tasks and the differences remained significant after controlling for discrete naming time. Second, both groups were slower in the large item set condition (20 × 4) than in the small set condition (5 × 16). Third, the dyslexia group was slower than the control group in both the pause and the articulation times. Although none of the processing skills was sufficient on its own to eliminate group differences in RAN Letters components, phonological awareness, and orthographic processing were sufficient on their own to eliminate group differences in the RAN Objects pause time. Taken together, our findings suggest that the deficits in RAN are not due to impaired anchoring, but rather due to subtle impairments in lexical access (specific to alphanumeric RAN), serial processing, and articulation."

The results demonstrated that both T1 morphological awareness and RAN directly and significantly explained a similar amount of variance in T3 reading comprehension and reading fluency. T1 Morphological awareness predicted T3 reading comprehension via T2 word-reading accuracy but not word-reading fluency, whereas the indirect influence of T1 RAN on T3 reading comprehension was not significant. In contrast, morphological awareness predicted reading fluency via word-reading accuracy and fluency, while RAN predicted it only via word-reading fluency not accuracy. The findings add to the growing literature by providing evidence of the similarities and differences in the cognitive underpinnings of reading comprehension versus reading fluency in Chinese children."

1,1536806285,clinical markers in italian speaking children with and without specific language impairment a study of non word and real word repetition as predictors of grammatical ability,2013,"marco dispaldro, laurence b leonard, patricia deevy",international journal of language & communication disorders,1,9,30,"Background

In many languages a weakness in non-word repetition serves as a useful clinical marker of specific language impairment (SLI) in children. However, recent work in Italian has shown that the repetition of real words may also have clinical utility. For young typically developing Italian children, real word repetition is more predictive of particular grammatical abilities than is non-word repetition. This finding is important because these particular grammatical abilities—the production of present-tense third-person plural inflections and direct-object clitic pronouns—are precisely those that are problematic for Italian-speaking children with SLI. Along with their grammatical requirements, these two morpheme types present a significant phonological/prosodic challenge for these children.



Aims

To replicate the findings with young typically developing Italian children and to determine whether real word repetition is also more predictive of the use of these two morpheme types than is non-word repetition in a group of Italian-speaking children with SLI.



Methods & Procedures

Seventeen Italian-speaking children with SLI and 17 younger typically developing children matched for mean length of utterance participated in tasks of real word and non-word repetition as well as tasks requiring the production of direct-object clitic pronouns and present-tense third-person plural inflections.



Outcomes & Results

Children with SLI were less accurate than their younger peers on all measures. Importantly, for the younger typically developing children, real word repetition explained a significant amount of variance in the use of third-person plural inflections and direct-object clitic pronouns. For the children with SLI, in contrast, non-word repetition was a significant predictor, whereas real word repetition was not a contributing factor.



Conclusions & Implications

It is argued that in Italian SLI, the grammatical details showing the greatest weakness present phonological/prosodic obstacles as well as grammatical challenges to these children. Consequently, non-word repetition emerges as a predictor of these grammatical weaknesses in SLI, unlike the profile observed in typically developing Italian children."

In recent studies, researchers have found that deficits in phonological processes could be an indicator for predicting reading outcomes for children with speech sound disorders. It has been theorized that children who exhibit articulatory errors are the result of the inadequacy of the speech perceptual acoustic characteristics of speech phoneme errors. Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact, if any, speech sound disorders have on school-age children and literacy and to determine if a relationship exists between children identified with a speech sound disorder and literacy achievement. Methods: A causal- comparative model was employed to investigate what possible effects speech sound disorders of school-age children have on reading achievement, and how it compares to children who are speech and language impaired and the norm group of students. Subjects for the study were collected using a stratified random sampling process from a local school district. Students were randomly chosen from each grade level (Kindergarten through 3rd grade) and then randomly selected again from each subgroup studied: 1) students identified as speech and language impairment, articulation (SLI-A), 2) students identified as speech and language impairment, language and articulation (SLI-LA however, in comparisons using the overall scores there were not any significant differences noted.

Learning to speak is one of life’s most important accomplishments. Language, usually acquired so effortlessly, underpins every child’s learning and ability to interact with others and to establish relationships. Poor communication has profound implications for employment, health, literacy, parenting the next generation, and social inequalities. It is therefore of great societal concern that language, speech, and fluency disorders are among the most common developmental disorders.

The aim of this clinical review is to summarise the current information on language and speech impairments to help general practitioners, universal well child services, and paediatricians to identify the most common problems, understand their clinical course, decide when to refer and for what services, and understand what improvements can be expected.

Understanding children's relationships within context is important for supporting children's development. Using child-friendly methodologies, the purpose of this research was to understand the lives of children with speech sound disorder (SSD) in context. Thirty-four interviews were undertaken with six school-aged children identified with SSD, and their siblings, friends, parents, grandparents, and teachers. Interview transcripts, questionnaires, and children's drawings were analyzed to reveal that these children experienced the world in context dependent ways (private vs. public worlds). Family and close friends typically provided a safe, supportive environment where children could be themselves and participate in typical childhoods. In contrast, when out of these familiar contexts, the children often were frustrated, embarrassed, and withdrawn, their relationships changed, and they were unable to get their message across in public contexts.

In each group, children's performances in early literacy skills (phonological awareness, letter knowledge, and word decoding) were assessed, as well as their achievement in linguistic and cognitive measures associated to these skills. The results showed that, notwithstanding the fact that there were no differences in word decoding, children with ID lagged behind on all predictor measures relevant to early literacy skills compared to children with NLA. Moreover, whereas children with NLA showed a regular predictive pathway of early literacy skills, children with ID showed a deviant pattern, in which nonverbal intelligence and rhythmic skills proved to be of major importance. Also letter knowledge appeared to be involved in their early literacy processing. It can be tentatively concluded that in the ID group, children's level of nonverbal intellectual abilities in combination with rhythmic ability proves pivotal in the development of their early literacy skills."

Genetic approaches including the identification of genes linked to speech and language phenotypes and the characterization of normal and aberrant functions of these genes have, in recent years, unraveled complex details of molecular and cognitive mechanisms and provided valuable insight into the biological foundations of language. Consistent with this approach, we have reviewed the functional aspects of allelic variants of genes which are currently known to be either causally associated with disorders of speech and language or impact upon the spectrum of normal language ability. We have also reviewed candidate genes associated with heritable speech and language disorders. In addition, we have evaluated language phenotypes and associated genetic components in developmental syndromes that, together with a spectrum of altered language abilities, manifest various phenotypes and offer details of multifactorial determinants of language function. Data from this review have revealed a predominance of regulatory networks involved in the control of differentiation and functioning of neurons, neuronal tracks and connections among brain structures associated with both cognitive and language faculties. Our findings, furthermore, have highlighted several multifactorial determinants in overlapping speech and language phenotypes. Collectively this analysis has revealed an interconnected developmental network and a close association of the language faculty with cognitive functions, a finding that has the potential to provide insight into linguistic hypotheses defining in particular, the contribution of genetic elements to and the modular nature of the language faculty."

The epidemiology of preschool speech sound disorder is poorly understood. Our aims were to determine: the prevalence of idiopathic speech sound disorder; the comorbidity of speech sound disorder with language and pre-literacy difficulties; and the factors contributing to speech outcome at 4 years.

Method
One thousand four hundred and ninety-four participants from an Australian longitudinal cohort completed speech, language, and pre-literacy assessments at 4 years. Prevalence of speech sound disorder (SSD) was defined by standard score performance of ≤79 on a speech assessment. Logistic regression examined predictors of SSD within four domains: child and family; parent-reported speech; cognitive-linguistic; and parent-reported motor skills.

Results
At 4 years the prevalence of speech disorder in an Australian cohort was 3.4%. Comorbidity with SSD was 40.8% for language disorder and 20.8% for poor pre-literacy skills. Sex, maternal vocabulary, socio-economic status, and family history of speech and language difficulties predicted SSD, as did 2-year speech, language, and motor skills. Together these variables provided good discrimination of SSD (area under the curve=0.78).

Interpretation
This is the first epidemiological study to demonstrate prevalence of SSD at 4 years of age that was consistent with previous clinical studies. Early detection of SSD at 4 years should focus on family variables and speech, language, and motor skills measured at 2 years."

Communication disorders, including speech sound disorder (SSD), can impair a child's academic, social and behavioral development. Speech sound disorder is a complex, polygenic trait with a substantial genetic component. However, specific genes that contribute to SSD remain largely unknown. To identify associated genes, we assessed the association of the DYX2 dyslexia risk locus and markers in neurochemical signaling genes (e.g., nicotinic and dopaminergic) with SSD and related endophenotypes. We first performed separate primary associations in two independent samples – Cleveland SSD (210 affected and 257 unaffected individuals in 127 families) and Denver SSD (113 affected individuals and 106 unaffected individuals in 85 families) – and then combined results by meta-analysis. DYX2 markers, specifically those in the 3′ untranslated region of DCDC2 (P = 1.43 × 10−4), showed the strongest associations with phonological awareness. We also observed suggestive associations of dopaminergic-related genes ANKK1 (P = 1.02 × 10−2) and DRD2 (P = 9.22 × 10−3) and nicotinic-related genes CHRNA3 (P = 2.51 × 10−3) and BDNF (P = 8.14 × 10−3) with case–control status and articulation. Our results further implicate variation in putative regulatory regions in the DYX2 locus, particularly in DCDC2, influencing language and cognitive traits. The results also support previous studies implicating variation in dopaminergic and nicotinic neural signaling influencing human communication and cognitive development. Our findings expand the literature showing genetic factors (e.g., DYX2) contributing to multiple related, yet distinct neurocognitive domains (e.g., dyslexia, language impairment, and SSD). How these factors interactively yield different neurocognitive and language-related outcomes remains to be elucidated."

This study considers the role of early speech difficulties in literacy development, in the context of additional risk factors.

Method
Children were identified with speech sound disorder (SSD) at the age of 3½ years, on the basis of performance on the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology. Their literacy skills were assessed at the start of formal reading instruction (age 5½), using measures of phoneme awareness, word-level reading and spelling; and 3 years later (age 8), using measures of word-level reading, spelling and reading comprehension.

Results
The presence of early SSD conferred a small but significant risk of poor phonemic skills and spelling at the age of 5½ and of poor word reading at the age of 8. Furthermore, within the group with SSD, the persistence of speech difficulties to the point of school entry was associated with poorer emergent literacy skills, and children with ‘disordered’ speech errors had poorer word reading skills than children whose speech errors indicated ‘delay’. In contrast, the initial severity of SSD was not a significant predictor of reading development. Beyond the domain of speech, the presence of a co-occurring language impairment was strongly predictive of literacy skills and having a family risk of dyslexia predicted additional variance in literacy at both time-points.

Conclusions
Early SSD alone has only modest effects on literacy development but when additional risk factors are present, these can have serious negative consequences, consistent with the view that multiple risks accumulate to predict reading disorders."

Recent studies indicate atypical structural and functional anomalies either in one hemisphere or both hemispheres, which might be accompanied by alterations in inter-hemispheric connectivity. Indeed, abnormalities of the corpus callosum – the main fiber tract connecting the two hemispheres – have been linked to speech and language deficits in associated disorders, such as stuttering, dyslexia, aphasia, etc. However, there is a dearth of studies examining the corpus callosum in SSD. Here, we investigated whether a sample of 18 children with SSD differed in callosal morphology from 18 typically developing children carefully matched for age. Significantly reduced dimensions of the corpus callosum, particularly in the callosal anterior third, were observed in children with SSD. These findings indicating pronounced callosal aberrations in SSD make an important contribution to an understudied field of research and may suggest that SSD is accompanied by atypical lateralization of speech and language function."

But children with dyslexia typically exhibit other problems, as well, including poor speech recognition in noise. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the speech-in-noise problems of children with dyslexia are related to their reading problems, and if so, if a common underlying factor might explain both. The specific hypothesis examined was that a spectral processing disorder results in these children receiving smeared signals, which could explain both the diminished sensitivity to phonological structure – leading to reading problems – and the speech recognition in noise difficulties. The alternative hypothesis tested in this study was that children with dyslexia simply have broadly based language deficits. NA NA NA Participants NA Ninety-seven children between the ages of 7 years; 10 months and 12 years; 9 months participated: 46 with dyslexia and 51 without dyslexia. NA NA NA Methods NA Children were tested on two dependent measures: word reading and recognition in noise with two types of sentence materials: as unprocessed (UP) signals, and as spectrally smeared (SM) signals. Data were collected for four predictor variables: phonological awareness, vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, and digit span. NA NA NA Results NA Children with dyslexia showed deficits on both dependent and all predictor variables. Their scores for speech recognition in noise were poorer than those of children without dyslexia for both the UP and SM signals, but by equivalent amounts across signal conditions indicating that they were not disproportionately hindered by spectral distortion. Correlation analyses on scores from children with dyslexia showed that reading ability and speech-in-noise recognition were only mildly correlated, and each skill was related to different underlying abilities. NA NA NA Conclusions NA No substantial evidence was found to support the suggestion that the reading and speech recognition in noise problems of children with dyslexia arise from a single factor that could be defined as a spectral processing disorder. The reading and speech recognition in noise deficits of these children appeared to be largely independent."

The purpose of this investigation was to examine the efficacy of the Teaching Early Literacy and Language (TELL) curriculum and associated evidence-based teaching practices. Participants included 91 preschool classroom teachers and 202 male and 87 female preschoolers with DSLI who were enrolled in their classes. Children ranged in age from 43 to 63 months. In this cluster RCT, classroom teachers were randomly assigned to implement the TELL curriculum or to continue with their business-as-usual (BAU) curriculum. Proximal outcomes were assessed with investigator developed curriculum-based measures (CBMs) administered six times over the school year. Distal tests (pre-post) of oral language and early literacy skills included an investigator-developed pre-post expressive and receptive vocabulary test, two additional standardized measures (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Preschool 2nd Edition, the Test of Preschool Early Literacy). A benchmarked early literacy assessment, the Phonological Awareness and Literacy Screening PreK, was also administered. Results indicated a significant TELL effect for all CBMs at later measurement points with Cohen's ds in the medium (0.43) to very large (1.25) range. TELL effects were also noted for the distal vocabulary measure with small to medium between-group effect sizes (Cohen’s f^2 range from 0.02 to 0.44). There were no significant TELL effects for the standardized distal measures. Based on progress measures, the TELL curriculum was effective for improving the oral language and early literacy skills of young children with DSLI."

Fourteen additional participants in a non-equivalent condition received a subset of tests. The interventions were delivered in 15-minute sessions, four times per week for nine weeks, in groups of three to four children. Group results were compared with pre/post and slope analyses. Children in the experimental groups performed reliably better on phonemic segmentation fluency, onset recognition fluency, and blending at posttest than children in control groups. No reliable differences between groups were found on phonological awareness measures that required generalization or on rapid retrieval on alphabetic understanding measures. Instruction at the phoneme and onset-rime levels were equally effective and efficient. (Contains 92 references.)

1,74988415,short term and working memory in children with specific language impairment,2006,lisa m d archibald,NA,0,13,447,"Investigations of the cognitive processes underlying Specific Language Impairment (SLI) have implicated deficits in the storage and processing of phonological or verbal information. This thesis reports five studies that investigated the role of short-term and working memory in children with SLI. Study 1 demonstrated SLI deficits on measures of verbal working memory, and short-term memory for verbal but not visuospatial information. Study 2 provided evidence that children with SLI perform at age-level on visuospatial working memory measures. Study 3 demonstrated slower processing in the SLI group across domains, as well as verbal storage decrements, with the greatest deficits found for tasks tapping both of these. Study 4 found SLI deficits on measures of nonword repetition in common use, with greater impairments on the task that relied to a lesser extent on short-term memory. Study 5 established more accurate recall for multisyllabic nonwords than matched single syllable lists for all groups, although the SLI group showed different patterns of phoneme retention. It is suggested that the combination of deficits in generalized processing speed and verbal storage in SLI may be expected to have a drastic and detrimental impact on learning, and provides an account of the disorder that could encompass the range of impairments observed in SLI. The findings also suggest that factors additional to short-term memory contribute to poor nonword repetition in SLI."

Several studies have indicated the importance of genetic factors in SLI; a positive family history confers an increased risk of development, and concordance in monozygotic twins consistently exceeds that in dizygotic twins. However, like many behavioral traits, SLI is assumed to be genetically complex, with several loci contributing to the overall risk. We have compiled 98 families drawn from epidemiological and clinical populations, all with probands whose standard language scores fall > or =1.5 SD below the mean for their age. Systematic genomewide quantitative-trait-locus analysis of three language-related measures (i.e., the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Revised [CELF-R] receptive and expressive scales and the nonword repetition [NWR] test) yielded two regions, one on chromosome 16 and one on 19, that both had maximum LOD scores of 3.55. Simulations suggest that, of these two multipoint results, the NWR linkage to chromosome 16q is the most significant, with empirical P values reaching 10(-5), under both Haseman-Elston (HE) analysis (LOD score 3.55; P=.00003) and variance-components (VC) analysis (LOD score 2.57; P=.00008). Single-point analyses provided further support for involvement of this locus, with three markers, under the peak of linkage, yielding LOD scores >1.9. The 19q locus was linked to the CELF-R expressive-language score and exceeds the threshold for suggestive linkage under all types of analysis performed-multipoint HE analysis (LOD score 3.55; empirical P=.00004) and VC (LOD score 2.84; empirical P=.00027) and single-point HE analysis (LOD score 2.49) and VC (LOD score 2.22).

This chapter examines phonological awareness, first by considering how it has been measured, and then, by studying factors related to performance on a frequently used measure of phonological awareness. A review of the literature showed that numerous tasks have been used to measure children’s awareness of phonemes. These can be divided into phoneme segmentation, phoneme blending, and sound comparison tasks. It is proposed that performance on phoneme segmentation and phoneme blending tasks is heavily influenced by experience with an alphabetic writing system. An investigation of a commonly used sound comparison task, the oddity task, suggested that performance on this task was dependent in part on chidren’s perceptual and memory abilities."

Realistic theories were developed in the form of Contexts (possible explanations for Outcomes), Mechanisms (the structures of the First Schools Project e.g. regular school visits) and Outcomes. There were two parts to the inquiry. Part 1 was concerned with identifying regularities (i.e., which Mechanisms of the First Schools Project were occurring with which Outcomes) and a questionnaire with school staff was used. The purpose of Part 2 was to explain those regularities by collecting data that would support, modify or challenge the realistic theories.

Daniel Research has shown phonological awareness to be a strong predictor of literacy. To support literacy development, a phonological awareness project was piloted in several West Virginia schools in 2001. This study compared WV educators based on employment setting (schools participating and those not participating in the phonological awareness project) and professional category (classroom teacher, reading specialist, speech-language pathologist) on answers to survey questions related to phonological awareness. Results showed no significant relationships between employment setting and responses. However, reading specialists reported spending more minutes per week providing phonological awareness instruction to children at risk for reading difficulty than did speech-language pathologists. Of concern was that over half of the responding speech-language pathologists reported no involvement in phonological awareness instruction in the regular curriculum, and over one-quarter reported that they did not provide phonological awareness instruction to children on their caseloads, who may be at risk for reading failure.

To have linguistic competence in a language, children are required to know about the component rule systems that govern language form and content. To have communicative competence, children must also know how to make language function or work for them during social interaction. While linguists agree that meaningful language is bound by a system of structural rules, there is no consensus among investigators on how children acquire knowledge of the regulatory system. A common feature of both continuity and maturation theories is that switch-setting occurs during critical periods of brain development and after a specific point in time, acquiring a first language becomes more difficult, if not impossible. Learning to read an alphabetic language draws on children's knowledge of language form, content, and use within the cultural context in which they live."

I investigated the relationship of access to the sound signal provided by the CI on a constellation of skills related to word-reading. In a preliminary study, I examined the relationship between the early speech production and perception skills of 72 CI users on later reading skills. Using regression analysis, I found I could explain 59% of the variance of later reading skills by early speech perception and production performance. Secondly, I examined the phonological processing skills of 29 children with prelingual, profound hearing loss with at least 4 years of CI experience. I compared this performance with 29 children with normal hearing, matched with regard to word-reading ability and Socio-Economic-Status. I also compared speech production and perception skills with phonological processing and reading skills. Results revealed that children with CIs were able to complete tasks measuring phonological processing, but there were performance differences between the two groups. Although the children with CIs had mean standard reading achievement standard scores that were about 12 points lower than the children with normal hearing, the mean standard scores for both groups was within the normal range. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that the Phonological Processing skills accounted for 50%, and 75% of the variance in word and paragraph reading scores for all the children.

research, however there has been limited research attention given to how children’s
relationships in late childhood may influence academic outcomes. While it is recognised
that parents and teachers play important roles in children’s lives, and that teachers play a

1,197661741,the development of a community based survey methodology for use with children with oral communication impairment,2002,diane patrice keating,NA,0,0,272,"BACKGROUND: Oral communication impairments (OCIs) are a common childhood problem with often long-term negative outcomes for both the child and society. NA Despite the growing body of knowledge about the epidemiology of this problem, the shift from traditional treatment approaches to population based approaches to management has been slow. NA One suggested reason for this is a lack of community based population data on such problems with which to plan services more broadly. AIM: The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the population knowledge of children with OCIs by developing and trialing a data collection method at a community level. LITERATURE REVIEW: One of the major issues in understanding OCIs from a population perspective is the disparate and often incongruent nature of epidemiological data reported in the literature. NA Five areas of epidemiological research were reviewed in order to critically evaluate the existing evidence base and identify gaps for further research. NA The five areas reviewed were: Prevalence (Regardless of the methodology used to collect prevalence data, OCIs have been described as a common childhood problem), Life Course (Children with OCIs often have ongoing communication problems and are at risk for poorer life outcomes in social, educational and occupational domains), Comorbidities (OCIs rarely occur in isolation and most children will have other developmental or health issues), Risk factors (There is no one easily definable cause of OCIs, however, genetic and environmental factors appear to increase the risk of OCI in the general population), and Service use (Only around half of children with recognised OCIs will access specialist intervention services).The review concluded that local community data measuring the 'burden', or impact, of the problem, comorbidities and service use in children with and without OCIs would assist in service planning. NA Therefore a methodology would need to be developed which addressed these issues.A further review of the literature considered this methodology development with specific reference to the issues of study design, sampling and identification of OCIs. NA The review concluded that a cross-sectional survey design of a community sample could provide the necessary data. NA Parent and teacher report was suggested as a method for identifying OCIs in surveys, however, a tool needed to be developed and trialed to ensure this method was effective, valid and reliable. PILOT STUDY: A survey tool for parents was designed which included the Child Health Questionnaire (PF - 28), questions relating to socio-demographic features, health and development conditions, service use and specifically developed questions regarding OCIs. NA The survey methodology was trialed in one school and one childcare centre. NA The results of the study were reviewed and suggestions made for methodological changes before a community trial was carried out. NA The reliability and validity of the questions designed to identify OCIs was assessed in a number of ways. NA Test-retest reliability of parent completed questionnaires proved to be good. NA Interrater reliability was examined by comparing parent and teacher responses. NA Parents and teachers agreed on identification of OCI in over 75% of cases for each of the OCIs studied. NA Criterion validity was assessed by comparing parent report to speech pathologist evaluation in a clinical sample and by comparing parent and teacher report to screening assessments of communication skills in a school sample. NA Both parents and teachers tended to over-identify children, however, when parent and teacher reports were considered together the validity approached that of the 'gold standard'. NA Construct validity was assessed by comparing reported OCIs with reports of other developmental conditions known to be commonly comorbid with OCIs. NA Once again using both parent and teacher report proved to be the most valid method of identifying OCIs using the developed tool. COMMUNITY STUDY: A targeted community survey of 3 to 7 year old children was conducted in a regional centre in Queensland, Australia. NA Children were sampled through schools and childcare centres. NA Information letters were distributed to the parents of 898 eligible children. NA Completed questionnaires were received for 397 children. NA Teachers completed questionnaires on 375 children which was 42% of the population sampled. NA Parents and teachers identified OCIs in 16% of the children. NA However, only 3% of the population were rated by parents or teachers as having severe problems. NA Over 70% of parents and teachers of children with a reported OCI rated the problem as having an impact on the child's life. NA Ratings of impact were not related to parent/teacher ratings of severity. NA Children with OCIs were reported to have significantly more health, developmental and behaviour problems than their peers. NA Children with OCIs were rated lower by their parents on most aspects of the Child Health Questionnaire (PF-28). NA In particular, parents reported impacts on their own time and family activities due to the child's problems. NA No significant differences were found between children with and without reported OCIs on any of the socio-demographic variables studied. NA Children with reported OCIs used more health and educational services than their peers. NA Around 60% of children with reported OCIs had seen a speech pathologist, but many parents had also sought advice from a range of other health and educational professionals. NA Those with two or more OCI conditions were more likely to have seen a professional, however socio-demographic variables did not generally predict service use. NA Parents reported that the type of service they chose was most commonly influenced by advice from a doctor or teacher. NA The limitations of this methodology for collecting this type of data are discussed. NA However despite these limitations data were collected which has major implications for the provision of population based services for children with OCI. CONCLUSION: This thesis has contributed to the understanding of children with OCIs by researching the development of a methodology to study this problem in a defined community sample. NA The information gained from the literature review and the community study were considered within two models of service provision. NA The models encompass service delivery from individualised to more population based approaches to the management of OCIs in children. NA From these models, specific suggestions for the community involved in the study were discussed. NA This thesis, therefore, provided a survey methodology that is resource efficient in the collection of community data useful in suggesting improved services for children with oral communication impairments."

Individuals with dyslexia usually have a disturbance in the phonological system, and this disturbance is manifested by: 


problems in segmenting words into phonemes


problems in keeping linguistic material (strings of sounds or letters) in the short-term memory


problems in repeating back long nonwords


problems in reading and writing even short nonwords


problems in naming colours, numbers, and things in pictures quickly a slower rate of speech, sometimes with an indistinct pronunciation


problems in playing word-games where the point is to manipulate phonemes (games like Pig-Latin: Ankay ooya eekspay lgpay Atinlay? Or spoonerisms, such as Inspector Clouseau’s A writ of fellous jadge for A fit of jealous rage)."

The term SDD refers to impairments in three domains of development, namely language and speech (communication), scholastic skills, and motor coordination, that cannot be explained in terms of intellectual retardation, physical handicap, or adverse environmental conditions. The categories all share the same pattern of diagnostic criteria: 

A:

The disturbance interferes significantly with academic achievement or activities of daily living that require language, speech, scholastic or motor ability.




B:

Performance in the developmental domain is substantially below what could be expected, given the person’s chronological age, measured intelligence, and (in case of learning disorders) age-appropriate education. In other words, there is a discrepancy between the observed and the expected performance.




C:

In the case of language difficulties, the disorder does not meet criteria for a pervasive developmental disorder. In the case of motor coordination problems, criteria for a pervasive developmental disorder are also not met, and the problems are not due to a general medical condition.




D:

In the case of learning difficulties: if a sensory deficit is present, the difficulties in learning are in excess of those usually associated with a sensory deficit.

In the case of language disorders: if mental retardation, a speech-motor or sensory deficit, or environmentally deprivation is present, the language difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with these problems.

In the case of motor disorders: if mental retardation is present, the motor difficulties are in excess of those usually associated with mental retardation. Furthermore, the disturbance is not due to a general medical condition and does not meet the criteria for a pervasive developmental disorder."

Since then, specific developmental reading disorder has been gradually recognized as a separate clinical entity. Various terms, such as word blindness (Orton, 1937), dyslexia (Money, 1962), specific reading retardation (Rutter & Yule, 1975), learning disability (Kirk, 1962), have been used to denote this disorder, that has been included in successive versions of DSM and ICD. In DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994) the disorder is called Reading Disorder and it is part of the section of ‘Learning Disorders’, while in ICD-10 (World Health Organization [WHO], 1992) Specific reading disorder is one of the subcategories of the section ‘Specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills’. Throughout this chapter I will use the term Specific reading disorder (SRD), and we treat this term as synonymous with concepts such as dyslexia or learning disabilities."

Writing disabilities, in particular, are under-diagnosed and under-treated and may be an unrecognized contributor to academic failure and school drop-out rates. The International Dyslexia Association (IDA) defines dyslexia as a specific learning disability characterized by unexpected difficulty in accuracy and rate of decoding, word reading and text reading, and spelling. Exclusionary criteria prevent confusion of dyslexia with reading problems having other biological causes. The University of Washington (UW) research team conducted confirmatory factor analyses to evaluate the measurement model based on latent traits underlying multiple indicators or measures of the same process. Current school assessment practices focus on making educational decisions about whether children qualify for special education services rather than on making differential diagnoses. Insufficient attention is given to etiology of reading problems, linking assessment to research-supported effective instruction, and prognosis for long-range outcomes."

The review also notes that there is a wide range in the methods used to identify children and it goes on to recommend that there needs to be a more systematic approach. One such approach would be to screen children before, or shortly after, school entry. The GAPS test has been designed as a screening tool to identify young children with language impairment and is reported to be of value in identifying children with language difficulties. However, the test has previously only been evaluated by its authors and the sensitivity of the test for identifying children from an unselected sample has not been evaluated.

Aims: This study evaluated the ability of the GAPS test to identify language-impaired children in an unselected sample. In addition, the effect of tester status (a trained researcher and a teaching assistant) was investigated.

Methods & Procedures: A total of 106 children aged 3–6 years completed the GAPS test, the Early Repetition Battery (ERB) and the core language scales from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals—Preschool 2 with a trained researcher. Half the children completed the GAPS test a second time with a teaching assistant.

Outcomes & Results: There was a significant effect of tester only for the non-word repetition subtest of the GAPS test in the nursery age group; the teaching assistants awarded higher scores than trained researchers. Of the 106 children, ten were language impaired according to the CELF-Preschool 2 core language score. The GAPS test identified two of these children at the 10th percentile cut-off, resulting in a low sensitivity estimate of 20%. However, the GAPS test only identified four of the 96 remaining unimpaired children resulting in a high specificity value of 96%. These values were similar when the 15th percentile cut-off was used and when parental concern or a family history of reading difficulties were used as the criterion measure.

Conclusions & Implications: These data show that although the GAPS test can be used by a range of people who work with young children, it is not a sensitive screener for language impairment when used by trained researchers."

The studies carried out utilised a combination of standardised assessments and experimental measures to investigate low-level perceptual to higher-order musical competencies. The theoretical framework motivating the studies comes from three broad theoretical accounts that differentially accentuate the auditory processing, cognitive and linguistic deficits in children with SLI, as well as from neuroimaging and behavioural studies showing that aspects of music and language processing rely on the same cognitive and neural mechanisms. Whilst a number of studies have investigated music perception in SLI, this thesis reports the first systematic and theoretically motivated study of this topic. The results from the studies revealed deficits in auditory short-term memory and procedural processing in SLI, supporting a domain general model of deficits in SLI. On the experiments that tested musical competencies, the children with SLI showed relatively preserved processing of melodic contour, implicit processing of musical harmony and appreciation of the emotional connotations of music. Whilst music perception was strongly associated with auditory short-term memory in typical controls, this was not the case for the children with SLI, and an alternative musical information processing strategy was proposed. The findings from this thesis indicate that although children with SLI demonstrate a range of impairments in language and cognitive functions, there are aspects of musical cognition that are relatively spared, and this has important implications for the development of therapeutic interventions."

Results revealed that children with preschool speech sound and language problems became poorer spellers at school age than did children with preschool speech sound disorders only. However, even children with isolated speech sound disorders demonstrated a weakness in spelling skills relative to their reading and language abilities and Weschler Performance IQ. Measures of phonological awareness were highly correlated with spelling skills, suggesting that phonological processing abilities are related to the ability to spell phonetically predictable words. Analysis of spelling errors based on level of phonological awareness skill revealed that children with preschool speech sound disorders utilize phonetic strategies in spelling phonetically predictable words. Familial aggregation of spelling disorders suggests a possible genetic component that is modified by gender."

The first group consisted of pupils with expressive/receptive language difficulties (E/RLD) and the second group included pupils with normally developing language skills (Non‐E/RLD).

The widely-used Accelerated Reader (AR) was the tool examined in the promotion of recreational reading. The major research questions determined if recreational reading, using Accelerated Reader, influenced reading vocabulary, comprehension, and attitude when socioeconomic status was low. Using the pre experimental design, seven Title I schools in urban Southeastern Virginia participated in pre-testing in September/October 1998 and post-testing in May/June 1999. Two independent variables, each with three levels, were manipulated: Type of AR Usage i.e. low (0-20 points), average (21-74 points), high (75 and above points) and Grade Level i.e. three, four, and five. Dependent variables reading vocabulary and comprehension were measured using the Gates-MacGinitie Tests of Reading, Form L on 755 students. The dependent variable attitude was measured on 515 students who completed The Elementary Reading Attitude Scale (ERAS). Results indicated: (1) the percentage of students testing below grade level for reading vocabulary and comprehension significantly decreased; (2) significant differences existed for type of AR usage and grade level effect; (3) as participation in the AR program increased, the mean score differences also increased; (4) attitude data revealed that only ""type of AR usage"" was significant; and (5) 51.8% of the sample earned low AR usage status, and below-grade-level readers comprised 33% of this group. Findings suggest that recreational reading, using AR, increases reading vocabulary, comprehension, and attitude, providing it is utilized as intended. (Contains 94 references and 8 tables of data.

Thesis supervised by Dr. Marygrace Yale-Kaiser. No. of pages in text. (80) The current study examined the link between early language ability and literacy and behavioral outcomes in children prenatally exposed to cocaine. Prenatal exposure to cocaine places children at risk for language delays and early language problems are linked to both literacy and behavior problems in elementary school. ((Bandstra, 2002; Beitchman et al., 2001; Cantwell & Baker, 1977). Participants included 141 primarily African-American children from low SES backgrounds who were enrolled in a birth through three intervention program. Children were followed through first and second grade to evaluate the impact early language ability had on literacy and behavior in elementary school. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that after controlling for gender, treatment group, cognitive ability, and behavior at age three, receptive language at age three was a significant predictor of picture vocabulary in elementary school (F(4, 125)=6.76, p<.01, bReceptive= .42, p<.01). Receptive language was also a significant predictor of Parent-reported prosocial behavior (F(7, 72) = 2.24, p<.05, bReceptive =-.03 , p<.05). Contrary to previous findings, early language did not significantly predict parent reported problem behavior in elementary school in this high risk sample. Future studies should explore risk and resiliency in this sample, along with increasing sample size to allow for more advanced statistical analyses. Findings support the importance of early language experiences on both later literacy and behavioral outcomes for children."

The aim of this paper is to synthesize the current scientific knowledge on the effectiveness of preventive metaphonological training for preschool children with language-based risks for reading disability. A comprehensive literature search yielded six controlled intervention studies that were included in a meta-analysis. The results provide evidence that an early training of phonological awareness has positive short and long term effects on the phonemic awareness of children with speech-language disorders. In contrast, the effect size for the literacy outcome in grade 1 was not significant, which argues against a substantial transfer effect of early metaphonological training on literacy skills. Following the discussion of these findings, implications for research and practice are outlined. (DIPF/Orig.)"

De symptomen in gesproken en geschreven taal overlappen elkaar en er worden dezelfde onderliggende oorzaken verondersteld. Een van de hypothesen is dat dyslexie en taalontwikkelingsstoornissen verschillende verschijningsvormen zijn van dezelfde onderliggende stoornis in de spraakperceptie. Deze hypothese werd getoetst middels een onderzoek naar de klankwaarneming van jonge kinderen met een genetisch risico voor dyslexie en jonge kinderen met een specifieke taalontwikkelingsstoornis. De resultaten bevestigen de hypothese: beide groepen kinderen zijn minder consistent in het classificeren van spraakklanken dan de controlegroep. Het effect is foneemspecifiek en geldt alleen voor klanken die perceptueel moeilijk van elkaar te onderscheiden zijn, zoals plofklanken. Er wordt beargumenteerd dat een spraakperceptiestoornis een van de componenten is van een Multiple-Risk Model dat ten grondslag ligt aan dyslexie en specifieke NA taalontwikkelingsstoornissen."

The quantitative objective of this review is to determine the best available evidence on the relationship between parents' responsiveness to children's prelinguistic and early communication and their subsequent communication development.
More specifically, the questions are:
1. What are the attributes of parental responsiveness? That is: To delimit the attributes of parents’ verbal and behavioural responsiveness and directiveness that influences children's preverbal and early communicative development.
2. Do some attributes of parent responsiveness have more consequence to children’s early communication development than others?
3. Is the amount or frequency of parent responsiveness important? That is: Do varying levels of parent responsiveness impact differently on children’s communication development?
4. Are there parental factors (e.g. education level) within the well population that predict or influence responsiveness quality and quantity? If so, what are they?
The textual objective is to identify the current social context within Australia, regarding the topic of parental responsiveness and children’s communication development. More specifically, the questions are:
1. Does current government policy on child development reflect the research evidence identified in the quantitative component of this systematic review?
2. What is society’s current awareness and standing (perception) on this topic, as identified through policy, expert and public opinion?
3. Are there preventative universal or selective health promotion measures in place relating to the review question?
4. If the answer to question 3 is ‘yes’, then what are they?

Inclusion criteria
Types of participants

What is the importance of phonological skills and underlying processes to reading achievement? Results show differences in degree of problems between dyslexic and SLI children. Patterns of results of performance between groups differ. This could imply that both groups differ in (other) underlying skills which explain poor performance on tasks of this study but are not necessarily related to reading achievement."

Gevonden verschillen zouden als indicatoren kunnen worden gebruikt voor de vroegtijdige signalering van dyslexie.

Vervolgens werden de geproduceerde fonemen en syllabestructuren geteld (onafhankelijke analyse) en vergeleken met de doeluitingen (relationele analyse). Samenvattend waren in beide groepen dezelfde ontwikkelingstendensen zichtbaar. Er werden geen significante verschillen gevonden in de fonologische en spraakmotorische vaardigheden tussen de risico en controle kinderen. Bij de Nazegtaak was wel een tendens te zien, dat controle kinderen meer profijt ondervonden van de lexicale status van een woord dan risico kinderen. Mogelijke verklaringen hiervoor zijn minder efficiente woordrepresentaties in het mentale lexicon en/of problemen bij het samenstellen van spraakmotorische programma’s vanuit nieuwe fonologische codes bij kinderen met een genetisch risico op dyslexie."

In this paper, we use a combination of family fixed effects and genetic marker instruments to estimate the causal effects of poor adolescent mental and physical health status on years of completed schooling. By exploiting the genetic variation in inheritance within families, this empirical strategy presents a unique opportunity to isolate the variation in genetic factors from other dynastic and family characteristics. We present evidence that inattentive symptoms in early childhood have large lasting effects in reducing completed schooling. We also find little consistent evidence that adolescent overweight status influences years of schooling completed."

The children's performance on these tests was used to predict language, reading, and spelling abilities at school age (age 8–11 years). Language impairment at school age was related to poor performance on preschool tests of syntax and nonsense word repetition, while reading impairment was predicted by poor performance in all preschool test domains (phonology, semantics, and syntax). In contrast, spelling impairment was predicted by deficits in preschool tests of phonological processing as measured by the Word Discrimination subtest of the Test of Language Development - Primary 2.

Such information could be crucial for policy purposes because the relation between health and academic achievement may be different for students at the bottom and top of the test score distribution. We find that several health conditions are highly negatively correlated with math and reading test scores, both on average and at different points of the achievement distribution.

In contrast, the literacy development of children with isolated speech problems was not significantly different from that of controls. A path analysis relating early speech, language, and literacy skills indicated that preschool language ability was a unique predictor of phoneme awareness at 5;8 (years; months), which, together with early reading skill, predicted literacy outcome at 6;9. Once the effects of phoneme awareness were controlled, neither speech perception nor speech production processes predicted variation in literacy skills.

The present study examined this question in a sample of RD and non-RD twins. Subjects with a history of PD were identified and the etiological relation between the two disorders was examined. Results indicated that in the present sample, RD and PD are each heritable on their own. Further, even when correcting for RD, the two disorders were found to be coheritable, indicating that the finding of cofamiliality of RD and PD is at least partially driven by genetic influences.

The results showed that the SLI and the (at‐risk of) dyslexia groups performed more poorly than the control children. Furthermore, with the exception of one child, all preschool SLI children scored significantly below the mean of the preschool control group, suggesting that non‐word repetition performance is a marker of SLI.

A single-subject research design was used to examine treatment effects among children with varying levels of communicative competence, to permit flexibility while piloting the intervention program, and to provide experimental control. The PASS rhyming module was implemented with eight children with speech and/or language impairments, following the establishment of a stable pretreatment baseline on a series of phonological awareness probes. After instruction, all of the children demonstrated substantial improvement in their rhyming ability, which generally appeared to be attributable to the intervention rather than environmental or maturational factors. These findings suggest that PASS rhyming training was an effective approach to phonological awareness instruction for the preschoolers with disabilities who comprised our sample. Thus, it appears that explicit instruction in phonological awareness skills is beneficial for children at a point earlier than is typically judged to be therapeutically appropriate."
1,1976698649,speech production deficits in early readers predictors of risk,2012,"judith g foy, virginia mann",reading and writing,1,16,77,"Speech problems and reading disorders are linked, suggesting that speech problems may potentially be an early marker of later difficulty in associating graphemes with phonemes. Current norms suggest that complete mastery of the production of the consonant phonemes in English occurs in most children at around 6–7 years. Many children enter formal schooling (kindergarten) around 5 years of age with near-adult levels of speech production. Given that previous research has shown that speech production abilities and phonological awareness skills are linked in preschool children, we set out to examine whether this pattern also holds for children just beginning to learn to read, as suggested by the critical age hypothesis. In the present study, using a diverse sample, we explored whether expressive phonological skills in 92 5-year-old children at the beginning and end of kindergarten were associated with early reading skills. Speech errors were coded according to whether they were developmentally appropriate, position within the syllable, manner of production of the target sounds, and whether the error involved a substitution, omission, or addition of a speech sound. At the beginning of the school year, children with significant early reading deficits on a predictively normed test (DIBELS) made more speech errors than children who were at grade level. Most of these errors were typical of kindergarten children (e.g., substitutions involving fricatives), but reading-delayed children made more of these errors than children who entered kindergarten with grade level skills. The reading-delayed children also made more atypical errors, consistent with our previous findings about preschoolers. Children who made no speech errors at the beginning of kindergarten had superior early reading abilities, and improvements in speech errors over the course of the year were significantly correlated with year-end reading skills. The role of expressive vocabulary and working memory were also explored, and appear to account for some of these findings."

Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine whether a group of children with SLI had abnormal changes in the auditory middle latency response (AMLR). AMLR was obtained for 19 SLI children and they were studied and compared to normal. Audiological assessment and speech language tests were done for the study group. The results revealed no significant statistical differences between SLI children and the normal with regard to AMLR (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that children with SLI do not have abnormal auditory system response at the level measured by AMLR casting doubt on affection of the hypnotized origin of AMLR, mainly primary auditory cortex, as a cause for delayed language development in those children."

The current treatment paradigm for neonatal brachial plexus palsy focuses on upper extremity motor recovery with little formal assessment of other aspects of development, such as language. We performed a cross-sectional pilot study to investigate early language delay prevalence in toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy and potential neonatal brachial plexus palsy–related factors involved. NA Method NA Twenty toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy were consecutively recruited (12 males and eight females; mean age, 30 months). Preschool Language Scale Score (4th edition), demographics, and socioeconomic status were collected. Neonatal brachial plexus palsy–related factors such as palsy side, treatment type, Narakas grade, muscle Medical Research Council score, and Raimondi hand score were reported. Student NA t NA test, chi-square test, or Fisher exact test were applied. Statistical significance level was established at NA P NA NA Results NA Of study participants, 30% had language delay, whereas the prevalence of language delay in the population with normal development in this age range was approximately 5-15%. NA Interpretation NA We observed high language delay prevalence among toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy. Although our subject sample is small, our findings warrant further study of this phenomenon. Early identification and timely intervention based on type of language impairment may be critical for improving communication outcome in this population."

Few studies, however, have examined the long‐term academic and literacy outcomes for this population, in particular as the students leave the final stages of primary school.Aims: The reported study forms the final stage of a longitudinal research project that tracked the phonological processing and literacy skills of a group of children with specific speech impairment from their first year at school (aged 5–6 years). The earlier data provided evidence of a relationship between speech impairment characterized by the presence of non‐developmental error processes and weaker phonological awareness and literacy skills in the first 2–3 years at school. It was hypothesized that the effect of this relationship would continue to be apparent as the students completed the final stages of primary school.Me..."

However, as behavioral performance represents the summed activity of multiple stages of processing, the temporal locus of the filtering deficit remains unclear. Here, we used an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to compare the earliest mechanisms of selective auditory attention in 12 children with specific language impairment (SLI) and 12 matched control children. Participants were cued to attend selectively to one of two simultaneously presented narrative stories. The stories differed in location (left/right speaker), narration voice (male/female), and content. ERPs were recorded to linguistic and nonlinguistic probe stimuli embedded in the attended and unattended story. By 100 ms, typically developing children showed an amplification of the sensorineural response to attended as compared to unattended stimuli. In contrast, children with SLI showed no evidence of sensorineural modulation with attention, despite behavioral performance indicating that they were performing the task as directed. These data are the first to show that SLI children have marked and specific deficits in the neural mechanisms of attention and, further, localize the timing of the attentional deficit to the earliest stages of sensory processing. Deficits in the effects of selective attention on early sensorineural processing may give rise to the diverse set of sensory and linguistic impairments in SLI children."

Two groups of first grade children participated: 39 children with a typical language development between the age of 73 and 88 months, and 59 children with SLI between the age of 71 and 97 months. The results indicated that children with SLI do have a quantitative delay in both grapheme knowledge and spelling during first grade. However, there was no qualitative difference between the early spelling of children with SLI and typically developing children. This indicated that children with SLI have the same spelling processes as typically developing children, although they develop slower. For clinical practice, this means that teachers of children with SLI can practice the same skills as with typically developing children, but they have to practice substantially more than typically developing children."

The nature of this relationship is unclear, despite the availability of a large number of studies, mostly on English speaking children. Phonological processing deficits have been considered the prominent cause of both difficulties. However recent findings in both children with SLI and in children with reading difficulties are not easily accommodated within a single dimensional model explaining the relationship between oral and written language deficits. NA Our study focuses on the long-term reading and spelling outcome in relation to preschool oral language skills in a group of Italian adolescents with a documented history of SLI. NA Sixteen Italian adolescents diagnosed as SLI at our Hospital in the pre-school years and 32 normal controls were submitted to an extensive assessment of oral and written language skills. At a group level SLI adolescents had weak oral and written language skills in almost all tests. NA Results show that reading difficulties have some features in common with those of Italian developmental dyslexics but also have distinct characteristics, since reading accuracy and written comprehension, usually relatively spared in Italian developmental dyslexics, were impaired in adolescents with SLI. NA Longitudinal analyses showed that expressive morpho-syntactic and lexical abilities at pre-school age were the oral language skills that best predicted reading and spelling outcomes in adolescents with SLI. NA However, also children with severe phonological impairment in the absence of other oral language deficits showed later literacy difficulties, although less severe and mainly limited to reading accuracy. NA Our study supports the notion that there is a complex relationship between oral and written language difficulties which may change at different developmental time points, not captured by a single deficit model, but best conceptualized considering multiple interactions between language skills and literacy abilities."

Twelve individuals with Down syndrome, whose data were originally reported in Roch and Jarrold (2008), were seen four years later, and were given the same tasks as in the previous study evaluating phonological awareness, non-word reading and irregular word reading. After four years, an improvement was observed in all the skills of interest. Furthermore, the pattern of relationships among the three skills was observed to change considerably across the four year period. At the first time point, a weak association between non-word and irregular word reading was found, but there was a strong association between these two measures at the second time point. In contrast, a strong relationship was found at Time 1 between non-word reading and phonological awareness, which became weaker at Time 2. Longitudinal associations between the three skills were also examined in order to explain this changing pattern of associations. The results indicated that the ability to decode non-words plays a marginal role on later irregular word reading. In contrast, irregular word reading is a longitudinal predictor of later non-word reading. Phonological awareness was not longitudinally related to nonword reading.

1,1992012603,training in phonological awareness generalizes to phonological working memory a preliminary investigation preliminary investigation,2009,"anne van kleeck, ronald b gillam, lavae m hoffman",NA,0,0,46,"Introduction Scholars and practitioners alike are by now well aware that children with language impairments are at increased risk for difficulties in learning to read (e.g., Aram, Ekelman, & Nation, 1984; Aram & Nation, 1980; Bishop & Adams, 1990; Gillam & Carlile, 1997; Korngold, Menyuk, Libergott, & Chesnick, 1988; Menyuk & Chesnick, 1997). The relationship between phonological awareness (PA) and early reading achievement has been clearly established for the general population (e.g., see reviews by Adams, 1990; Blachman, 1994; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987). It is also been well-documented that children with language impairments have delays in phonological awareness abilities (e.g., Bird, Bishop, & Freeman, 1995; Bishop & Adams, 1990; Catts, 1993; Kamhi & Catts, 1986; Kamhi, Lee, & Nelson, 1985; Menyuk & Chesnick, 1997), and intervention studies have shown that we can successfully foster PA skills in preschoolers and kindergartners with both speech and language impairments (e.g., Gillon, 2000, 2002; Laing & Espeland, 2005; Segers & Verhoeven, 2004; van Kleeck, Gillam, & McFadden, 1998). Phonological awareness, however, is only one of the phonological processing skills known to be important to early decoding. In addition to PA, the contributions of phonological working memory (WM) to early decoding (word attack skill in early reading) have been well established for children who are typically developing, children with reading disorders, and children with language impairments (see Catts & Kamhi, 1999; Goswami & Bryant, 1990; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987 for reviews). Phonological WM has been measured by both word and nonword repetition and span tasks. Of these two kinds of measures, nonword recall tasks are believed to more ""purely"" reflect phonological working memory, since they must be carried out independent of semantic lexical knowledge (Gathercole, in press; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990; Henry & Millar, 1991). Studies outside of the area of reading corroborate that children with language impairment perform more poorly than age- and language-matched peers on nonword repetition and nonword span tasks, suggesting that these children have a diminished phonological WM capacity (e.g., Bishop, North, & Donlan, 1996; Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998; Edwards & Lahey, 1998; Ellis Weismer, Tomblin, Zhang, Buckwalter, Chynoweth, & Jones, 2000; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990; Gillam, Cowan, & Day, 1995; Gray, 2003, 2004; Marton & Schwartz, 2003; Montgomery, 1995, 2000a, 2000b). As we continue to work to develop interventions that take empirical findings regarding the basic cognitive underpinnings of early decoding into account, these findings might lead us to ask if we should be targeting phonological WM in addition to PA in order to provide the best possible foundation for later early decoding skills in children with language impairments. First, however, we might ask if it is feasible to directly improve phonological WM skills. We know that nonword recall is highly heritable (Bishop et al., 1996) and that it is not readily affected by environmental influences (Alloway, Gathercole, Willis, & Adams, 2004; Campbell, Dollaghan, Needleman, & Janosky, 1997). One possible consequence of these facts is that the phonological memory skills underlying nonword recall may be resistant to treatment (Gathercole, in press). We are aware of only one study that has trained children in nonword repetition in order to improve phonological WM, and hence early reading ability. The study involved 120 Greek-speaking kindergartners who were assigned randomly to a control or treatment group (Maridaki-Kassotaki, 2002).

1,1992898741,auditory perceptual processing in people with reading and oral language impairments current issues and recommendations,2001,"genevieve mcarthur, dorothy v m bishop",dyslexia,1,167,63,"A popular hypothesis holds that specific reading disability (SRD) and specific language impairment (SLI) result from an impaired ability to process rapid and brief sounds. However, the results of experiments that have tested this hypothesis are incongruous. A number of factors could explain these contradictory findings, including the questionable reliability and validity of rapid auditory processing tasks, individual differences in the auditory processing abilities of SRD and SLI populations, the age of listeners, the quality of control groups, and the relationship between verbal and non-verbal auditory processing abilities. These issues highlight the need for future studies to (1) establish the reliability and validity of psychophysical tasks used to assess rapid auditory processing; (2) report the rapid auditory processing scores of individuals rather than just group means; (3) include a wide range of reading and spoken language tests to determine the literacy and oral language profile of people who demonstrate an auditory processing deficit; (4) include clinical comparison groups to determine whether a rapid auditory processing deficit is related specifically to written and spoken language impairments; and (5) examine the relationship between low-level non-verbal, verbal, and phonological processing abilities.

However, to bridge the gap between neurobiology and behavior, we must understand higher cortical functions at the behavioral level at least as well as we have come to understand neurobiological processes at the cellular and molecular levels. This is certainly the case in the study of speech processing, where critical studies of behavioral dysfunction have provided key insights into the basic neurobiological mechanisms relevant to speech perception and production. Much of this progress derives from a detailed analysis of the sensory, perceptual, cognitive, and motor abilities of children who fail to acquire speech, language, and reading skills normally within the context of otherwise normal development. Current research now shows that a dysfunction in normal phonological processing, which is critical to the development of oral and written language, may derive, at least in part, from difficulties in perceiving and producing basic sensory-motor information in rapid succession – within tens of ms (see Tallal et al. 1993a for a review)."

Therefore, there is little information about the sensitivity and specificity measures of these tests. Item difficulty and item discrimination scores were derived for 199 words that were varied for phonotactic shape, syllable numbers and stress. Fifty-nine normally speaking children and 40 children with speech impairments in the age range of 2-9 years named pictures depicting the above words. Most words had satisfactory item difficulty scores indicating ease of naming. The words that best differentiated between children with and without speech impairment were monosyllabic words containing word-initial and/or word-final clusters and polysyllabic words, that is, words of three or more syllables. Disyllabic and polysyllabic words beginning with a weak syllable also seemed to be highly discriminating.

At age 5;6 the SU group was subdivided into those whose language problems had resolved, and those with persistent SU. The General Delay group was also followed up. At age 15-16 years, these children were compared with age-matched normal-language controls on a battery of tests of spoken language and literacy skills. Children whose language problems had resolved did not differ from controls on tests of vocabulary and language comprehension skills. However, they performed significantly less well on tests of phonological processing and literacy skill. Children who still had significant language difficulties at 5;6 had significant impairments in all aspects of spoken and written language functioning, as did children classified as having a general delay.

One at-risk group, late talkers, appeared normal in all respects except for their delayed language. These 20 children scored at or below the fifteenth percentile for expressive vocabulary on the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory ( Fenson et al., 1993 ) when originally identified at 20–27 months of age and within the normal range on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development ( Bayley, 1969 ). The other group, 21 children with unilateral focal brain injury, suffered localized damage to their brain prenatally, perinatally, or within the first 6 months of life. Results indicated that both of the at-risk groups were still significantly lower in vocabulary diversity and grammar at 3 years of age. There was also significantly greater variability in the at-risk groups than in the control groups, and in the children with focal brain injury than in the late talkers in both areas. The importance of language comprehension to development in this period was supported by two findings. First, children with focal brain injury had significantly lower scores than late talkers on the Index of Productive Syntax, a test of emerging grammar, and had been lower in comprehension on a standardized test of language comprehension a year earlier. Second, late talkers with delay in comprehension as well as production had significantly lower scores on IPSyn than those with normal comprehension, suggesting that they are at greater risk for continued delay. Qualitative analyses indicated that the at-risk groups produced the same kinds of errors, but that late talkers produced a substantially greater proportion of errors in obligatory contexts than did children with focal brain injury."

Children with speech and language impairment appear to be at increased risk for phonological processing problems and hence literary difficulties. However, not all children with speech and language impairment experience difficulties: the literature is not clear as to which groups of speech and language impaired children are most severely affected nor which aspects of phonological processing are most likely to be impaired. Rigorous subject selection was employed to compare the performance of four groups of 20 children, aged approximately 6 years: speech-impaired (Speech); language-impaired (Language); speech and language impaired (Mixed); and children with normally developing language (Normal), by use of a battery of phonological processing tasks. The results supported the research that has shown speech and language impaired children to have weaker phonological processing skills than the general population. All the subjects in this sample appeared to be at risk: the Mixed children demonstrated the most difficulty, followed by the Language group, with the Normal group performing the best. Whilst the Speech group as a whole performed significantly more poorly than the Normal group, it consisted of two levels of performance which, on post hoc analysis were shown to relate to the pattern of speech impairment exhibited by the child."

The present study aimed to (1) determine whether these children with a history of LD had deficits in basic reading skills, i.e. decoding and comprehension, compared to the age norms of standardized tests, (2) analyze if there was a relationship between reading outcome and neuropsychiatric diagnosis by comparing three subgroups of children, LD pure, LD + ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and LD + ADHD, and, (3) determine what language measures at age 6 years were associated with the 7–8-year reading outcome. Both decoding and comprehension of single word reading were significantly below the norm for the whole LD group, where children with LD + ASD scored lowest, and children with LD highest. However, the differences between the three groups did not reach significance. Two reader groups were identified according to the results of word decoding and comprehension, respectively, resulting in the same 7 children. ANOVA revealed that the only differences on the 6-year language tests between the two groups were found on color naming and word memory. This study has shown that children with LD and subsequently identified neurodevelopmental problems such as ASD and ADHD experience continued deficits, demonstrated also in reading skills and that the picture of the reading problems seemed to resemble those of typically developing children."

For instance, children with these diagnoses often show learning, social adjustment or behaviour disorders in adolescence. On the other hand, many professionals claim that early intervention has a significant effect on these disorders. The question which arises is whether early intervention can forestall the development of these more serious consequences in adolescence. The aim of this study is to examine adolescents who had been diagnosed with SDLD in childhood and who had attended during their preschool years an Early Intervention Programme (EIP) within a Community Mental Health Centre. These adolescents' outcomes are compared with those of adolescents who had also been diagnosed with SDLD, but who had not complied with therapy. The experimental group (N = 44), now have a mean age of 13 years, whereas the control group (N = 52), who had not accepted therapy, have a mean age of 14 years. The parameters which were investigated were school achievement, social and emotional adjustment, behaviour, language skills, and their parents' attitudes. Statistical analysis shows that although some of the treated adolescents now exhibit learning difficulties, those who began their therapy before the age of 5 are presently showing significantly better concentration and behaviour than all the other groups. In conclusion, early intervention seems to be effective for children with SDLD and may restrict the appearance of more serious social adjustment and behavioural problems in adolescence."

Physical assault by the partner toward the mother was not significantly correlated with reading skills. Higher incidence of risk factors was significantly associated with risk for reading disabilities.

Relationships among reading skills, autistic symptomatology, and language-related abilities were also investigated. The results indicate that both reading accuracy and comprehension are deficient but that the development of these skills progresses in a consistently parallel fashion to what would be expected from a normative sample of same age peers. Language-related abilities were strongly associated with reading skills. Unlike individuals with SLI only, those with SLI and additional autistic symptomatology had adequate reading accuracy but did not differ from the individuals with SLI only in reading comprehension. They exhibited a significant gap between what they could read and what they could understand when reading. These findings provide strong evidence that individuals with SLI experience continued, long-term deficits in reading skills from childhood to adolescence."

Children who participated in the study (N= 147) demonstrated profound sensorineural hearing loss and had used cochlear implants for between 6 months and 10 years. Educational programs that used an oral communication (OC) approach focused on the development of spoken language, whereas educational programs that used a total communication (TC) approach focused on the development of language using both signed and spoken language. Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) we compared the consonant-production accuracy, receptive spoken vocabulary, and expressive spoken and/or signed vocabulary skills, over time, of children who were enrolled in schools that used either OC or TC approaches, while controlling for a number of variables. These variables included age at implantation, preoperative aided speech detection thresholds, type of cochlear implant device used, and whether a complete or incomplete active electrode array was implanted. The results of this study indicated that as they used their implants the children demonstrated improved consonant-production accuracy and expressive and receptive vocabulary over time, regardless of whether their school employed a TC or OC teaching method. Furthermore, there appeared to be a complex relationship among children's performance with the cochlear implant, age at implantation, and communication/teaching strategy employed by the school. Controlling for all variables, children in OC programs demonstrated, on average, superior consonant-production accuracy, with significantly greater rates of improvement in consonant-production accuracy scores over time compared to children in TC programs. However, there was no significant difference between OC and TC groups in performance or rate of growth in consonant-production accuracy when children received their implants before the age of 5 years. There was no significant difference between the OC and TC groups in receptive spoken vocabulary scores or in rate of improvement over time. However, children in the TC group achieved significantly higher receptive spoken vocabulary scores than children in the OC group if they received their implant before the age of 5 years. The TC group demonstrated superior scores and rates of growth on the expressive vocabulary measure (spoken and/or signed) when compared to the OC group if they received their implants during their preschool or early elementary school years. There was no significant difference if the children received their implants during middle elementary school. Regardless of whether children were in the OC or TC group, children who received their implants during preschool demonstrated stronger performance, on average, on all measures over time than children who received their implants during their elementary school years. The results of this study suggest that children may benefit from using cochlear implants regardless of the communication strategy/teaching approach employed by their school program and that other considerations, such as the age at which children receive implants, are more important. Implications and future research needs are discussed."

These results suggest impairment in executive functions, phonological working memory and semantic memory among dyslexic children, rather than impairment of just phonological abilities, as suggested in previous studies."

They were compared to a control group of 14 typically developing 6- and 7-year-olds of comparable word reading abilities. Results showed that, although individuals with Down syndrome had impaired nonword reading and phonological awareness skills, the same relationship held between these two abilities as was observed in the group of typically developing children. Moreover, individuals with Down syndrome read at least as well as the typically developing children when the task required a visual reading strategy (reading irregular words). Learning outcomes: (a) understanding of the main issues related to the development of reading skills in Down syndrome; (b) understanding of the role played by phonological awareness in learning to read; (c) understanding of the importance for education of the strong relationship between phonological awareness and reading skills in Down syndrome."

The language development profile of children at-risk for dyslexia is compared to that of age-matched controls as well as of children who have been diagnosed with specific language impairment (SLI). The experiments described concern the perception and production of grammatical morphology, categorical perception of speech sounds, phonological processing (non-word repetition), mispronunciation detection, and rhyme detection. The results of each of these indicate that the at-risk children as a group underperform in comparison to the controls, and that, in most cases, they approach the SLI group. It can be concluded that dyslexia most likely has precursors in language development, also in domains other than those traditionally considered conditional for the acquisition of literacy skills.

A range of cognitive and linguistic skills were assessed in a sample of 137 eight-year-old children with SLI at the beginning of the school year, and 6 months later on word decoding and reading comprehension. The cognitive and linguistic measures revealed four factors that were called language, speech, short-term memory, and phonological awareness. Structural equation modeling showed word decoding to be predicted by speech, short-term memory, and phonological awareness, whereas reading comprehension was predicted by word decoding skills and short-term memory. It can be concluded that in children with SLI variations in early word decoding are mostly determined by speech abilities and short-term memory, and to a lesser extent by phonological awareness. Moreover, reading comprehension turns out to be highly dependent on word decoding and short-term memory."

The condition is frequent amoung tow-and three-year-olds, causes concern among parents, and generates differences of opinion as to significance among informed professionals. Poorer long-term outcomes are much more likely if language delay persists until the later preschool year, and if the dealy is not specific to language and/or includes problems in understanding. Specific language delay in the preschool period is better characterized as a risk factor than disorder, most children with specific language delay recover to the normal range by five years of age."

The two groups of readers were indistinguishable in their production of the two-syllable words dippy, deepy, tippy, and teepy and in their perception of the stop consonants /d/ versus /t/. Less skilled readers were significantly less accurate than the skilled readers in a vowel identification task involving the lax and tense high vowels /i/ and /i/. The error pattern for vowel identification was similar across groups, with both groups making fewer errors when short and longer segments were alternated. The results imply that vowel phonemes are less securely represented in the perceptual system of less skilled readers than are consonant phonemes. In addition, the results raise the possibility that a selective perceptual impairment underlies at least some of the phonemic awareness problems that have been associated with poor reading."

Results show that Italian children with SLI aged 6 to 9;11 years fail to produce DO clitics and tend to produce a lexical noun introduced by a determiner (full DP) in the argument postverbal position instead of the pronoun; the production of reflexive clitics is preserved in the same population. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses and computation of likelihood ratios show that the failure to produce DO clitics is a persistent good clinical marker of SLI in Italian. We argue that DO clitic production requires complex morphosyntactic operations that are hardly achieved by children with SLI; our findings are compatible with theories considering...

Written narratives were elicited from children using a sequence of five photographs depicting a simple story, and were analysed for grammatical complexity and accuracy, intelligibility, and semantic content. Only 42 of the twins could spell well enough to attempt the narrative task. Some co-twins of affected children had deficits in written language, despite normal performance on oral language tests. Most children with language impairments were poor at writing, with particularly marked deficits on a measure of spelling and punctuation. Children with language impairments made a relatively high proportion of phonologically inaccurate spelling errors when compared with younger children at a similar vocabulary level. Those who did poorly on a nonword repetition test were especially likely to have poor written language. However, four children with pure speech difficulties produced age-appropriate written narratives."

Production of fricatives in words may be one marker because they are later developing sounds and contribute to syntactic production. We examined whether children who produced fricatives in words by 18 months had better vocabulary and grammar scores at 18, 24, and 30 months than children who did not. NA NA NA Method NA The expressive language skills of 37 toddlers who did and did not produce fricatives in words by 18 months of age were compared at 18, 24 and 30 months of age. NA NA NA Results NA Expressive vocabulary scores and the use of grammatical markers were significantly better for children who produced fricatives by 18 months than for those who did not. This effect was consistent across scores at 18, 24, and 30 months. The total number of consonants and total number of fricatives produced at 18 months did not significantly predict expressive vocabulary scores. NA NA NA Conclusions NA Because the children who produced fricatives by 18 months demonstrated better expressive language skills than their peers who did not produce fricatives by 18 months, the early production of fricatives by toddlers may be a marker of a faster expressive language developmental trajectory. NA NA Learning outcomes: NA Readers will: (1) describe the relationship between early phonological development and early expressive lexical development, (2) describe the role of perceptual and motor development in speech sound the acquisition, and (3) describe the potential relationship between the production of fricatives and expressive language development."

It evaluated associations among oral and hand motor speeds and measures of speech (articulation and phonology) and language (receptive vocabulary, sentence comprehension, sentence imitation), in 11 children with moderate to severe SSD and 11 controls. Syllable durations from a syllable repetition task served as an estimate of maximal oral movement speed. In two imitation tasks, nonwords and clapped rhythms, unstressed vowel durations and quarter-note clap intervals served as estimates of oral and hand movement speed, respectively. Syllable durations were significantly correlated with vowel durations and hand clap intervals. Sentence imitation was correlated with all three timed movement measures. Clustering on syllable repetition durations produced three clusters that also differed in sentence imitation scores. Results are consistent with limited movement speeds across motor systems and SSD subtypes defined by motor speeds as a corollary of expressive language abilities."

Parents provided narrative responses to open-ended questions about how they would handle common discipline challenges with children and rated their likelihood of using physical punishment. Parents also reported the number of books they read with their children each week and completed a checklist assessing their familiarity with the titles and authors of children’s books. Children’s emergent literacy skills were assessed with individually administered tests. Analyses of covariance indicated that shared book reading was reliably associated with children’s language comprehension skills only among parents whose responses to discipline scenarios included relatively high levels of nondirective reasoning. Parents who expressed a willingness to consider physical punishment had children with lower language comprehension skills regardless of the quantity of shared book reading. These effects were reliable after taking into account the effects of parental education and children’s nonverbal reasoning skills."

The pattern of ABRM and ID scores suggests that a subset of children with concomitant oral language and reading impairments has poor ABRM thresholds, and that a subgroup of children with an SLI or SRD has poorer ID thresholds than controls. The latter result warns against using rapid auditory processing tasks that do not actively control for auditory discrimination ability. Further, some unusually poor ABRM scores and ID scores question the validity of extreme scores produced by children on psychophysical tasks. Finally, the poor oral language scores of many of the children who had impaired reading highlight the need to test the oral language skills of SRD samples to ascertain how homogeneous and specifically disabled they really are."

This paper examined the ‘Distinct’ hypothesis—that SLI and dyslexia have different cognitive deficits and behavioural manifestations (e.g., Catts, Adolf, Hogan, & Weismer in J Speech Lang Hear Res 48:1378–1396, 2005) in Chinese children in Primary 1. Ninety-four six- to seven-year-old Chinese children completed a norm-referenced test for oral language and for literacy, as well as cognitive tasks related to reading development. Based on results from the norm-referenced tests, 40 children fell in the typically-developing Control group, 10 children in the dyslexia-only (D) group, 19 in the SLI-only group and 25 children in the SLI-D group. Orthographic skills and lexical access and retrieval skills were found to be associated with dyslexia. Phonological memory and morphological awareness were associated with SLI. Phonological awareness was associated with both SLI and dyslexia. SLI and dyslexia in Chinese did not seem to be distinct disorders as they were both characterized by a deficit in phonological awareness. Implications for clinical practice were discussed."

NA NA NA Material-methods: NA Thirty-three children with functional articulation disorder were enrolled in this study. They ranged in age from 6 to 10 years. A control group without articulation disorders was composed of 160 children with similar properties. In the first stage of this study, both groups were administered the Ross Information Processing Assessment Test-Primary. In this test, the scores obtained from eight subtests; namely immediate memory, recent memory, recall of general information, spatial orientation, temporal orientation, organization, problem solving and abstract reasoning, was calculated for both groups. The scores of the eight subtests are combined to form the four composites. These composites are memory quotient, orientation quotient, thinking and reasoning quotient and information processing quotient. Information processing quotient is the best and the most comprehensive estimate of a child's overall information processing ability. In the second stage of the study the articulation-disordered group was divided into two subgroups according the number of the mistakes, which was done at the level of the phoneme. The scores obtained from both subgroups were compared with the scores of the control group. NA NA NA Results: NA The overall statistical analysis of the scores revealed that; the study group had significantly lower scores than the control group from memory quotient, thinking and reasoning quotient and information processing quotient. When compared to control group, the subgroup who cannot pronounce one phoneme had similar scores from all four composites. Moreover, the children who cannot pronounce multiple phonemes had significantly lower scores from memory quotient, thinking and reasoning quotient and information processing quotient. The results obtained from this study seem to be suggesting that information processing skills of children with functional articulation disorder are significantly low as compared to normal children. NA NA NA Conclusions: NA These results are revealing that the information processing skills of children with functional articulation disorder should be investigated in a detailed manner. According to the results obtained from this investigation these children should be put on deficit oriented education programs in addition to articulation therapy."

However, this past research has examined older children, and it is unclear whether such deficits emerge earlier in development. It is also unclear whether atypical refractory effects differ for linguistic versus non-linguistic stimuli or can be explained by deficits in selective auditory attention reported among children with SLI. In the present study, auditory refractory periods were compared in a group of 24 young children with SLI (age 3–8 years) and 24 matched control children. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded and compared to 100 ms linguistic and non-linguistic probe stimuli presented at inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 200, 500, or 1000 ms. These probes were superimposed on story narratives when attended and ignored, permitting an experimental manipulation of selective attention within the same paradigm. Across participants, clear refractory effects were observed with this paradigm, evidenced as a reduced amplitude response from 100 to 200 ms at shorter ISIs. Children with SLI showed reduced amplitude ERPs relative to the typically-developing group at only the shortest, 200 ms, ISI and this difference was over the left-hemisphere for linguistic probes and over the right-hemisphere for non-linguistic probes. None of these effects was influenced by the direction of selective attention. Taken together, these findings suggest that deficits in the neural representation of rapidly presented auditory stimuli may be one risk factor for atypical language development."

This article raises issues about the appropriateness of intervention targeting phonological awareness abilities and cautions against the wide scale adoption of new interventions for children with differing symptoms of disorder. Relatively little is known about the phonological awareness development of children with speech impairment. A review of the literature on normal acquisition of phonological awareness abilities reveals wide variation in children's development. It is affected by educational exposure and socioeconomic class. Many 4year-old children with typically developing speech and language skills exhibit limited phonological awareness knowledge and subskills and do not necessarily show a steady improvement with maturation. Recent research indicates that phonological awareness intervention holds promise for children with speech impairment (e.g., Gillon, 2000). However,..."

A group of 293 preschool children were administered an assessment battery that included measures to examine oral language, nonverbal cognition, emergent reading, and writing. Children were divided into four groups based on their language and cognitive performance. The findings from this study show that as early as preschool, children with weaker oral language skills lag behind their peers with stronger oral language skills in terms of their writing-related skills. Children with oral language and cognitive deficits performed more poorly than children whose deficits were confined to oral language.

Here, we demonstrate two novel genotype-phenotype models implemented in a flexible genetic modeling platform. The examples come from analysis of families with specific language impairment (SLI), a failure to develop normal language without explanatory factors such as low IQ or inadequate environment. In previous genome-wide studies, we observed strong evidence for linkage to 13q21 with a reading phenotype in language-impaired families. First, we elucidate the genetic architecture of reading impairment and quantitative language variation in our samples using a bivariate analysis of reading impairment in affected individuals jointly with language quantitative phenotypes in unaffected individuals. This analysis largely recapitulates the baseline analysis using the categorical trait data (posterior probability of linkage (PPL) = 80%), indicating that our reading impairment phenotype captured poor readers who also have low language ability. Second, we performed epistasis analysis using a functional coding variant in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene previously associated with reduced performance on working memory tasks. Modeling epistasis doubled the evidence on 13q21 and raised the PPL to 99.9%, indicating that BDNF and 13q21 susceptibility alleles are jointly part of the genetic architecture of SLI. These analyses provide possible mechanistic insights for further cognitive neuroscience studies based on the models developed herein."

We examined the relationship between FM direction and rate selectivity and the precise temporal interactions of excitatory and inhibitory sideband inputs. Extracellular single-unit recordings were made in the auditory midbrains of eight mustached bats. Up- and down-sweeping linear FM stimuli were presented at different modulation rates in order to determine FM selectivity. Brief tone pairs with varying interstimulus delays were presented in a forward masking paradigm to examine the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. In the 33 units for which tone pair data were collected, a correspondence existed between FM rate selectivity and the time delays between paired tones. Moreover, FM directional selectivity was strongly linked to rate selectivity, because directional preferences were expressed only at certain rates and not others. We discuss how abnormalities in the relative timing of inputs could alter or abolish the selectivity of such neurons, and how such a mechanism could account for the perceptual deficits for formant transitions seen in certain children with phonological deficits."

Print referencing is a strategy implemented within the context of adult–child shared storybook reading interactions, and specifically refers to the use of verbal and nonverbal cues to encourage children’s attention to and interactions with print. Print referencing increases the metalinguistic focus of storybook reading interactions. When print referencing is delivered within the children’s zone of proximal development, clinicians can foster children’s movement from dependent to independent mastery of key emergent literacy concepts. This clinical exchange provides suggestions for using print referencing as a clinical tool, including a theoretical overview of this approach and descriptions of clinical targets."

Autopsy studies have reported unusual symmetry of the planum temporale (PT) in patients with dyslexia. Methodological limitations characterize much of this literature, however. NA Objective: NA To examine the size and asymmetry of the PT and its extension into the parietal lobe (planum parietale [PP]) in men with well-characterized, persistent dyslexia by using magnetic resonance imaging and 3-dimensional surface rendering techniques. NA Methods: NA The brains of 16 right-handed dyslexic men aged 18 to 40 years and 14 matched control subjects were studied with magnetic resonance imaging. Most of these subjects were previously studied with positron emission tomography, which demonstrated functional abnormalities in temporal and parietal brain regions in the dyslexic group. The area of the PT was determined with the aid of 3-dimensional surface-rendering techniques. The size of the PP was estimated by measuring the length of the posterior ascending ramus on 3 parasagittal slices. NA Results: NA Approximately 70% to 80% of both groups showed equivalent leftward (left>right) asymmetries of the PT; approximately 50% to 60% showed equivalent rightward (right>left) asymmetries of the PP. These asymmetries showed equivalent moderate inverse correlations with each other in both groups. NA Conclusions: NA These results challenge the notion that anomalous asymmetry of the PT is strongly associated with developmental dyslexia. Given the heterogeneity of the dyslexic population, some subgroup of dyslexic individuals (ie, those with developmental language disorders) may show unusual symmetry or reversed asymmetry in this region. However, anomalous asymmetry of the planum did not contribute to functional abnormalities demonstrated in these patients by positron emission tomography."

Yet roughly 7% to 8% of children who are otherwise healthy and of normal intelligence exhibit unexplained delays and impairments in acquiring these skills. Ongoing research has revealed several key features of language disability that may pro-vide more direct insight into underlying anomalous neural functioning. For example, evidence supports a strong association between basic defects in processing rapidly changing acoustic information and emergent disruptions in speech perception, as well as cascading effects on other forms of language development (including reading). Considerable neurobiological research has thus focused on developmental factors that might deleteriously influence rapid sensory processing. Additional research focuses on mechanisms of neural plasticity, including how such brains might be “retrained” for improved processing of language. These and related findings f..."

NA NA NA Participants NA Children exposed to cocaine in utero (PCE; NA n  = 175) and non-exposed children (NCE; NA n  = 175) were followed prospectively to 10 years of age and were compared on language subscales of the Test of Language Development-Intermediate 3rd Edition (TOLD-I:3) and phonological processing as measured by the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP). NA NA NA Methods NA Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), linear regression, and logistic regressions were used to evaluate the relationship of prenatal cocaine exposure to language development, while controlling for confounders. NA NA NA Results NA After controlling for confounding variables, prenatal cocaine effects were observed for specific aspects of language including syntax (Sentence Combining subtest of the TOLD-I:3, NA p  = 0.001), semantics (Malopropism subtest of the TOLD-I:3, NA p  = 0.05) and phonological processing (Phonological Awareness subscale, NA p  = 0.01). The caregiver factors of vocabulary, HOME, and psychological symptoms also had consistent effects on language subtests and phonological processing scores.

Cocaine exposed girls had lower scores on the phonological awareness subscale of the CTOPP than non-exposed girls. NA NA NA Conclusions NA PCE has subtle effects on specific aspects of language development and phonological processing at age 10, even after controlling for confounding variables. Environmental factors (i.e., postnatal lead exposure, home environment, and caregiver vocabulary and psychological symptoms) also impact language skills at 10 years. Adoptive or foster care appears to enrich PCE children's linguistic environment and protects children against language delay in the PCE sample."

Por otro lado, pretendiamos comprobar si las puntuaciones obtenidas en el CEG podrian ser un indicador del rendimiento escolar de los alumnos, esta vez tambien segun los criterios de los tutores. Con respecto al primer objetivo, la correlacion obtenida entre la puntuacion total del CEG y cada uno de los apartados de la EVLO es significativa en todos ellos, oscilando los valores entre -0,477 (escucha) y -0,621 (escribe). Dado que las preguntas formuladas en la EVLO son todas referidas a aspectos linguisticos en sus dominios orales y escritos, podemos afirmar que el CEG es un instrumento valido a efectos de la determinacion del rendimiento escolar de los ninos en el ambito linguistico. En lo referente al segundo objetivo nuestros resultados indican que el rendimiento academico de los ninos que puntuan por encima del centil 67 en el CEG es valorado por sus tutores de forma muy positiva, a la inversa de lo que sucede con los ninos cuyas puntuaciones en el CEG se situan por debajo del centil 33.

1,2060602472,dyslexia reading difficulty reassessing the evidence for a developmental model,1998,barbara kelly,educational research,1,1,47,"Summary The exploration of the nature of reading difficulty, particularly dyslexia, began with working hypotheses which rested on two assumptions, neither of which were supported by empirical evidence. These assumptions were that cognition and reading are related (and interdependent) processes and that a specific type of reading difficulty ‐‐ dyslexia ‐‐ characterized a distinct group of poor readers ‐ i.e. those with average and better intellectual ability. In this context, the word ‘dyslexia’ refers (more precisely) to specific developmental dyslexia (SDD), as opposed to ‘acquired’ dyslexia, reading difficulty, which arises as a result of illness or injury. A study by Rutter and Yule challenged both (by then long‐standing) assumptions and proposed that reading difficulty might be seen as a developmental outcome of early language related deficit or delay and environmental factors. This notion has not been adequately explored, mainly because of a continued theoretical bias towards reading/IQ discrepancy m..."

Fifty eight toddlers with Bayley Mental Development Indices from 35-85 participated. All children had fewer than 3 words in their expressive vocabularies and showed at least one instance of intentional prelinguistic communication prior to testing. At the beginning of the study, children's prelinguistic behavior regulation, social interaction, and joint attention were measured. One year later, children's expressive vocabulary was measured. Results indicated that rate of joint attention and rate of communication were statistically significant predictors of later expressive vocabulary. Rate of behavior regulation was not a predictor. There were too few instances of social interaction to test its predictive validity."

In this article, we discuss the commonalities between reading and language disorders within the context of a model of reading development that posits phonological skills are a critical foundation for learning to read. Children with dyslexia and specific language impairment typically share a continuity of risk for decoding deficits in reading that can be traced to phonological problems, whereas children who have wider language problems are at risk of reading comprehension deficits.

NA NA NA Method NA Participants were 151 kindergarten and first-grade children and 40 SLPs. Video-recorded therapy sessions were coded to determine the amount of time that addressed literacy. Assessments of children's literacy skills were administered as well as questionnaires regarding characteristics of SLPs (e.g., service delivery, professional development). NA NA NA Results NA Results showed that time spent addressing code-related literacy across therapy sessions was variable. Significant predictors included SLP years of experience, therapy location, and therapy session duration, such that children receiving services from SLPs with more years of experience, and/or who utilized the classroom for therapy, received more literacy-focused time. Additionally, children in longer therapy sessions received more therapy time on literacy skills. NA NA NA Conclusions NA There is considerable variability in the extent to which children received literacy-focused time in therapy; however, SLP-level factors predict time spent in literacy more than child-level factors. Further research is needed to understand the nature of literacy-focused therapy in the public schools. NA Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to: (a) define code-based literacy skills, (b) discuss the role that speech-language pathologists have in fostering children's literacy development, and (c) identify key factors that may currently influence the inclusion of literacy targets in school-based speech-language therapy."

The acquisition of literacy in an alphabetic script such as English makes heavy demands on linguistic skills. The relation between spoken and written language however, is far from straightforward. This article reviews the research that suggests that phonological processing skills are crucial in the translation of symbols to sounds, and the development of rapid and automatic decoding skills. It examines research that indicates that children whose phonological processing skills are compromised in some way, are at-risk of experiencing difficulties in the acquisition of literacy; it supports the suggestion that dyslexia can be viewed as lying on the continuum of developmental language disorders. It goes on to relate theory to practice and discusses the responsibilities of health care professionals in relation to the early identification of dyslexia, and makes suggestions regarding intervention. In particular, it looks at the responsibilities of speech and language therapy services in the care and management of children with dyslexia."

NA Speed , NA nature , and NA knowledge transfer NA of spelling acquisition were taken into account. Four orthographic characteristics that influence early spelling, namely, ‘Type of Grapheme’, ‘Grapheme Position’, ‘Number of Graphemes’, and ‘Word Structure’ were examined at the middle and at the end of first grade. At the beginning of first grade when children were between 71 and 97 months, they performed well below national norms on assessment of active grapheme knowledge. The delay in word spelling persisted, but decreased between the middle and the end of first grade. Despite this delay, the findings suggest that characteristics of early spelling for children with SLI are rather similar to those of children with typical language development. For example, children with SLI represented more graphemes at the end of first grade than at the middle of first grade, found it easier to represent the initial grapheme in words than the final or medial grapheme (Grapheme Position), were more successful spelling shorter than longer words (Number of Graphemes), and spelled words with simple structures (CVC) more accurately than those with complex structures (CVCC and CCVC; Word Structure). Finally, participants demonstrated that they can use known graphemes to spell words, but the transfer between active grapheme knowledge and word spelling was not always stable. NA NA Learning outcomes: NA As a result of this activity, readers will be able to explain the NA speed NA and the NA nature NA of spelling acquisition of children with SLI.

Speech and language development should be consistent with a child's overall development and can be tracked using typical milestone markers. Differential diagnosis is critical to designing appropriate intervention, which should be tailored to the parents' goals along with the child's clinical and educational needs.

However, recent evidence has been equivocal with data suggesting problems in the spectral domain. The present study examined event-related potential (ERP) measures of auditory sensory temporal and spectral processing, and their interaction, in typical children and those with LI (7–17 years; n=25 per group). The stimuli were 3 CV syllables and 3 consonant-to-vowel transitions (spectral sweeps) isolated from the syllables. Each of these 6 stimuli appeared in 3 durations (transitions: 20, 50, and 80 ms; syllables: 120, 150, and 180 ms). Behaviorally, the group with LIs showed inferior syllable discrimination both with long and short stimuli. In ERPs, trends were observed in the group with LI for diminished long-latency negativities (the N2-N4 peaks) and a developmentally transient enhancement of the P2 peak. Some, but not all, ERP indices of spectral processing also showed trends to be diminished in the group with LI specifically in responses to syllables. Importantly, measures of the transition N2-N4 peaks correlated with expressive language abilities in the LI children. None of the group differences depended on stimulus duration. Therefore, sound brevity did not account for the diminished spectral resolution in these LI children. Rather, the results suggest a deficit in acoustic feature integration at higher levels of auditory sensory processing. The observed maturational trajectory suggests a non-linear developmental deviance rather than simple delay."

1,2077843157,potential advantages of introducing specific language impairment to families,1999,"c melanie schuele, pamela ann hadley",american journal of speech language pathology,1,10,67,"Children with language delays 1 can be divided broadly into two groups, those with secondary and those with primary language difficulties. Children with secondary language difficulties have language difficulties that are associated with or predicted by sensory, biological, neurological, cognitive, or socioemotional deficits (e.g., hearing impairment, Down syndrome, autism). In contrast, children with primary language difficulties present with typical development with the exception of language (and in some cases concomitant speech problems). Over the years, children with primary language difficulties have been referred to in the literature and in clinical practice by a number of terms, including speech/language delay, speech/language disorder, speech/language impairment, childhood aphasia, developmental dysphasia, developmental language disorder, language learning disability, and specific language impairment (SLI). Some of these terms have been used for children with secondary language difficulties as well. There has been much discussion from a professional perspective as to the usefulness of these terms and how these terms should be applied in clinical as well as research practices (e.g., Kamhi, 1991, 1998; Lahey, 1990; Plante, 1998). There has been less discussion as to how these terms influence families’ understanding of their children’s difficulties. The purpose of this article is to advocate for the usefulness, primarily from the perspective of families, of SLI as a diagnostic category. Specific language impairment or SLI is the most prevalent term used in the research literature over the past decade to describe children with primary language difficulties (cf. Leonard, 1998), yet there does not appear to be widespread clinical use of SLI, as a label or as a diagnostic category (cf. Kamhi, 1998). Our clinical interactions led us to question why there was this disparity between research and clinical practice (cf. Wilcox & Ingram, 1998). In the course of evaluating preschool and earlyschool-age children with primary language difficulties and developing ongoing clinical relationships with families, we found that most families showed little interest in our efforts to describe their children’s language difficulties (cf. Aram, 1991). Consistent with Tomblin’s (1991) observations, families were far more interested in knowing why their children were having difficulty learning to talk, what they could do about it (beyond simply taking the child to treatment), and what to expect with regard to long-term outcomes. Time and again, families were perplexed that their children seemed quite normal or typical in many respects, yet had such pronounced language difficulties. For families who had accessed services through local school districts, the IDEA eligibility categories of “developmental delay” and “speech/language impaired” often were confusing. The parents reported that these terms did not help them understand what was wrong with their child. To adequately address families’ concerns, we found it necessary to differentiate clearly between groups of children who might have language disorders. That is, we had to clarify that their children’s language difficulties were not attributable to autism, hearing impairment, mental retardation, and so on and to establish that there exists a group of children who are typical in all respects with the exception of language. One parent in particular made us realize how important it was to have a label for her child’s condition. This mother returned to the clinic with a child development trade book in hand, opened it to the chapter on special needs, and asked “Which one of these does he have?” She wanted a label because she wanted independently to find out more about her child’s difficulties. Further, she needed to share this label with family and friends to help them understand her child. Interestingly, broad-based terms such as language delay or language disorder did not suffice, perhaps because these terms can be (and frequently are) applied to all children with language difficulties. As a result In this article, the terms “language delay” and “language difficulty” are employed as generic terms to describe all children who evidence language deficits as compared to their same-age peers, regardless of the etiology."

Results revealed a significant difference between children who were typical and children who were SLI on the sound-segmentation tasks. The children who were typical were more effective at segmenting than were children who were SLI. Significant differences were also noted between the types of phonological task completed among participants. The combined data from this study revealed developmental trends in phonological awareness for the typical population. The developmental trend was not observed in the SLI population, however.

Using a developmental typology inspired by some of the literature on speech development (Kahn and Lewis, The Kahn-Lewis phonological analysis, 1986; Shriberg, Journal of Speech and Hearing Research 36(1):105–140, 1993a), we found that failure to master the early-8 consonants and a greater prevalence of certain types of production errors were associated with deficient phonological awareness. We also found that children who made no consonant errors had advanced phonological awareness relative to other children in the sample. In all cases, both productive speech patterns and speech errors were more closely linked with rhyme awareness than with phoneme awareness. The association between speech production and rhyme awareness may provide some new directions for the early preschool assessment of risk for reading problems."

Forty children, ages 6 to 9 years, were divided into control or domestic violence groups based on their mothers' responses on the revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2). The groups were matched on age, gender, nonverbal IQ, and socioeconomic status. The domestic violence group performed worse than the control group on all measures of reading and phonological awareness. Significantly more children in the domestic violence group were identified as having reading difficulties compared to the control group. The results suggest that domestic violence may negatively impact children's reading skills, and appropriate intervention techniques should be developed."

Some of the key issues explored are procedures to enhance children's language development, decoding and word recognition skills, along with some relevant assessment and programming strategies that can facilitate children's early reading development. In particular, the paper supports the suggestion that deficits in phonological awareness are often a consequence of slow vocabulary development (a classic marker of language delay) and that teachers need to be able to adapt their language and dialogue interactions for children with language delays."

A key function of the auditory system is to integrate sensory inputs that belong together and segregate those that come from different sources. We hypothesized that this skill is impaired in individuals with phonological processing difficulties. There is considerable disagreement about whether phonological impairments observed in children with developmental language disorders can be attributed to specific linguistic deficits or to more general acoustic processing deficits. However, most tests of general auditory abilities have been conducted with a single set of sounds. We assessed the ability of school-aged children (7–15 years) to parse complex auditory non-speech input, and determined whether the presence of phonological processing impairments was associated with stream perception performance. A key finding was that children with language impairments did not show the same developmental trajectory for stream perception as typically developing children. In addition, children with language impairments required larger frequency separations between sounds to hear distinct streams compared to age-matched peers. Furthermore, phonological processing ability was a significant predictor of stream perception measures, but only in the older age groups. No such association was found in the youngest children. These results indicate that children with language impairments have difficulty parsing speech streams, or identifying individual sound events when there are competing sound sources. We conclude that language group differences may in part reflect fundamental maturational disparities in the analysis of complex auditory scenes."

Consonant deletion seems to be more frequent in long words (words of three or more syllables) than in short words (words of one or two syllables). However, it may be missed in long words because they are not routinely assessed and, even if they are, there is little normative data about them. The study aims were (1) to determine if a relationship exists between consonant deletion and the number of syllables in words, (2) delimit variation in the numbers of children using it, its frequency of occurrence and the words it affects and (3) to discuss the application of these data to clinical practice. The participants were 283 typically developing children, aged 3;0 to 7;11 years, speaking Australian English with proven normal language, cognition and hearing. They named pictures, yielding 166 selected words that were varied for syllable number, stress and shape and repeatedly sampled all consonants and vowels of Australian English. Almost all participants (95%) used consonant deletion. Whilst a relationship existed between consonant deletion frequency and the number of syllables in words, the syllable effect was interpreted as a proxy of an interaction of segmental and prosodic features that included two or more syllables, sonorant sounds, non-final weak syllables, within-word consonant sequences and/or anterior-posterior articulatory movements. Clinically, two or three deletions of consonants across the affected words may indicate typical behaviour for children up to the age of 7;11 years but variations outside these tolerances may mark impairment. These results are further evidence to include long words in routine speech assessment."

Although most of these children learn to read with relative ease, approximately 10% have signifi cant difficulty acquiring proficient reading skills (Shaywitz & Shaywitz, 1994). As a result of their reading problems, these children often go on to struggle in school and beyond (Lyon, 1998).

Method: The current study used a 2 · 2 MANOVA design (with follow-up MANCOVAs) to examine how a comorbid language impairment (LI) and the persistence of SSD relate to pre-literacy skills in a sample of 5- to 6-year-old children with SSD. Results: Significant main effects for persistent SSD and LI were obtained, such that each factor was associated with worse performance on pre-literacy tasks, particularly those assessing phonological awareness (even with nonverbal IQ covaried).

No differences between group means were observed in SNH and CA control groups on vocabulary, digit and sentence recall, sentence comprehension, and literacy scores. However, there was considerable individual variation within the SNH group. Nearly 50% of the SNH group showed phonological impairment associated with poorer expressive and receptive vocabulary and higher hearing thresholds than remaining children without phonological impairment. Nonword repetition deficits were observed in SNH subgroups with and without phonological impairment and were of a similar magnitude to those observed in children with SLI. Indeed, poorer repetition in children with SLI could only be differentiated from children with SNH on phonologically complex nonwords. Overall, findings suggested major problems in nonword repetition and phonological impairment occurred without clinically significant deficits in wider language and literacy abilities in children with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss. Implications for theories of SLI are discussed."

The role and outcomes of focus groups conducted with participants in a World Wide Web Project in literacy assessment and intervention are reported. Thirteen individuals with severe communication impairments participated in one of three focus groups. The groups were held after an assessment of reading skills and a trial period of intervention as part of the Web Project. The aim of the focus groups was to obtain feedback from participants about their involvement in the project and to discuss strategies for the next stage of the intervention. The focus groups offered a forum for participants to talk about what they did and did not like about the assessment and trial intervention. The discussions provided information about issues of both a practical and emotional nature that might have otherwise been unavailable to the researchers. Brainstorming of strategie...

Multivariate analysis of covariance was performed to compare 16 language and literacy outcomes between children with large expressive vocabulary size at 24 months (N = 1,073) and those with smaller expressive vocabulary size. Comparisons between large and small verb size groups as a measure of lexical composition were also conducted. Our findings indicate that, after controlling for gender, birth order, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, total vocabulary size at age 2 can significantly predict subsequent language and literacy achievement up to fifth grade. Moreover, vocabulary size is a better predictor of later language ability than lexical composition."

In normally developing children, learning to read is strongly related to early language skills, and in particular to phonological processing abilities. In dyslexic children, reading abilities seem to show a correlation with phonological awareness.



Methods  A group of 65 children (aged 5–6 years) were recruited and submitted to an in-depth neuropsychological assessment [i.e. metaphonological skills, intelligence, verbal short-term memory (VSTM) and other aspects of receptive and expressive language]. We were able to identify 14 children with significant metaphonological difficulties (MD): 11 children with exclusively MD, and the other three children with specific language impairment. This study compares the neuropsychological profile obtained from children with MD with that of a peer group without any language impairment (N).



Results  The performances of the MD were within the normal ability range in almost all the administered tests but significantly lower compared with those of their peers without language impairment (N) in some items of the intelligence scale (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence) and in the tests of VSTM and of receptive/expressive language. Nevertheless, there were not statistically significant differences between MD and N in output phonology.



Conclusions  In pre-school age, in a group of non-clinical children, with a range of abilities, those with MD appear to be at the lower end of the normal range in many other verbal skills. These children could be considered at-risk for possible subsequent difficulties learning to read and thus need to be identified and to warrant prompt treatment."

In the first study, 10 low income kindergarteners with specific language impairment (SLI) were compared with age- and income-matched classmates on reciting common nursery rhymes, reciting the alphabet, and rote counting. Children with SLI displayed lower performance on most of the rote linguistic sequence tasks, especially on (heir knowledge of Mother Goose nursery rhymes. The second study examined the learning and retention of nursery rhymes in 8 young children with SLI after 6 weeks of classroom instruction. Low-income, 4- and 5-year-old children with SLI and their age- and income-matched classmates were taught five novel Mother Goose rhymes during a large-group classroom activity. Children were tested before and after the intervention on their ability to recite nursery rhymes and to detect rhyme. When compared with their peers, children with SLI had difficulty repeating the nursery rhymes, despite daily classroom exposure. Although the performance of children with SLI on rhyme recitation and detection tasks was poor, their relative performance was better on a cloze task based on the set of nursery rhymes. The results of this study suggest that children with SLI have difficulty storing and/or retrieving lines of memorized text. Traditional informal techniques for teaching rote linguistic sequences may need to be modified to give children with SLI more opportunities to practice rote sequences."

1,2113561777,genetic influences on language impairment and literacy problems in children same or different,2001,dorothy v m bishop,journal of child psychology and psychiatry,1,115,32,"Data from two twin studies are examined to assess genetic and environmental influences on literacy, and the etiological relationship between language and literacy. Study 1 used children from 86 families previously recruited for a study of the genetics of specific language impairment (see Bishop, North, & Donlam, 1995), who completed tests of single-word reading and spelling. Literacy problems in this sample were common, were strongly heritable, and showed a close genetic relationship with poor nonword repetition. Study 2 included two subsets of children: 37 twin pairs who had taken part in study 1, 3 to 4 years earlier, and 100 twin pairs recruited from the general population by Bishop et al. (1999). All children were given a standardised test of nonword reading. There was no genetic influence on nonword reading ability, either across the normal range, or at the lower extreme, though there were significant associations with some social variables. However, bivariate DeFries-Fulker analysis suggested that in this study, as in study 1, there was shared genetic variance between poor nonword repetition and literacy deficits. It is concluded that poor nonword repetition, which is known to be highly heritable, puts the child at risk for literacy problems. However, in a general population sample, such as that included in study 2, poor nonword repetition is a relatively rare correlate of literacy problems, which are more likely to have an environmental origin. Thus the different pattern of results in the two studies can be explained if one assumes that genetic influences are substantial only when literacy problems are severe and/or accompanied by oral language difficulties."

The Early Reading Screening Instrument (ERSI) was given to 149 end-of-the-year kindergarten children. Half of the sample was tested 1 year later with standardized reading measures. Total ERSI scores from the kindergarten children strongly correlated with reading skills in first grade. Reading comprehension in first grade was the skill most strongly predicted by the subjects' total ERSI scores. The word recognition and invented spelling subtests of the ERSI were the best variables to be selected as predictors of first grade word analysis, word identification, and passage comprehension skills. A split-half reliability study of the ERSI showed that a shortened form could be used with the same degree of predictive validity. The ERSI or similar tools can be used to assess reading readiness in kindergarten children so that we can promptly begin an intervention to prevent or, at the very least, to diminish risk for reading failure. For screening reading readiness across different languages or cultures, the content of the four ERSI subtests can easily be modified."

The present study considered the relative contribution analogy abilities make toward early reading ability. Two analogy tasks and measures of phonological awareness, orthographic knowledge, visual memory, general language ability, and non-verbal intelligence were administered to 20 second grade good readers and 20 third and fourth grade poor readers. The analogy tasks did make a significant contribution to early reading ability; however, the analogy tasks were not very different from the measures of reading they predicted. In other words, it seems difficult to isolate the use of analogies from basic phonological decoding abilities."

The main finding of this study was that a diagnosis of SI or LI can have a detrimental and persistent effect on early reading skills. Results indicated differences between subgroups in growth trajectories that were evident in first grade. A large proportion of students with SI or LI did not meet grade-level reading fluency benchmarks. Overall students with SI showed better performance than students with LI. Reading fluency performance was negatively related to the persistence of the SI or LI; the lowest performing students were those originally identified with SI or LI whose diagnosis changed to a learning disability. The results underscore the need to identify, monitor, and address reading fluency difficulties early among students with SI or LI."

In general, the results indicated that language abilities (both phonological processing and oral language) significantly contributed to achievement in the early stages of reading (2nd grade) and had an even stronger effect as children acquired greater reading proficiency (4th grade)."

The intervention included instruction in PA and sound-symbol correspondence. Sixty-four school-age children with LI (Grades 1-3) were assigned to either an experimental (n = 34) or a control group (n = 30). Eleven kindergarten-age children with LI were then included as a comparison grade group to investigate whether the magnitude of treatment effect changed across grade level in the experimental group (K-3). Participants in the experimental group (Grades 1-3) made significantly greater gains in PA and reading (e.g., decoding and text comprehension) than the control group. Similar gains were observed across the varying grade levels (K-3). These results suggest that, despite being at risk of reading failure, school-age children with LI in Grades 1 through 3 have the potential to make accelerated gains in their reading development and in the PA skills that are essential to successful literacy acquisition."

Data to support this assumption are most evident in studies that demonstrate a reciprocal relationship between the metalinguistic skill of phonemic awareness and word decoding. The purpose of this review was to examine the contribution of other oral language abilities to early reading performance. Specifically, we examined studies that assessed metasemantics, metasyntax/metamorphology, and narrative discourse in relation to word decoding or reading comprehension with children in kindergarten through third grade. We found that although phonemic awareness retained its prominence as a predictor of early reading skills, metasyntactic ability often accounted for significant variance.

The following tests were used as diagnostic criteria: reading and dyslexia test and Wechsler intelligence scale for children-revised. Moreover, a reading inventory consisting of 100 words was developed by researchers to assess the reading ability of the subjects. Data were collected in three phases: baseline, intervention, and follow-up. During the intervention phase, the intervention strategies were used while during baseline and follow-up, data were collected without any intervention. Comparing three phases of the study, we may conclude that intervention package consisting of direct instruction of phonological awareness was an effective strategy in reading achievement of all three students.

Communication skills are a necessity both in the academic and social atmosphere of the school environment. Unfortunately, there are a large number of children in the schools today identified with speech and language disorders. This special edition of Psychology in the Schools examined issues that impact the academic and social functioning of such children. Several articles are focused on potential early intervention strategies or services surrounding literacy and social skills that may enhance the success of children with communication disorders and/or at risk for communication disorders (e.g., Chapman, Denning, & Jamison, 2008; Thatcher & Fletcher, 2008; van Kleeck, 2008). Two other articles tackle promising strategies that may be used in academic settings with children who stutter (Logan, Mullins, & Jones, 2008) or with children with cognitive impairments (Gillette & DePompei, 2008). Despite promising avenues of intervention and practice, there are also barriers to providing instruction to children with communication disorders in a regular classroom (Pufpaff, 2008). Each article provides insight into the importance of communication skills for academic and social success in the schools. The key to the success of children with or at risk for communication is for all school personnel to be aware of and proactive with children with communication disorders.

Of these children, more than 21% received services for speech and language disorders; this percentage does not include children who have communication problems secondary to other conditions. Children with communication disorders may experience difficulty with academic and social experiences in the school environment. Traditional intervention has addressed the communication disorder as an isolated issue, not accounting for the far-reaching effects that children may experience. However, many practitioners and researchers now understand the role of communication and its relationship to success in school (Blachman, 1984; Catts, 1993; Fey, Catts, & Larrivee, 1995; Lewis & Freebairn, 1992). This special issue of Psychology in the Schools was designed with the goal of addressing the needs of children identified with communication disorders in the schools through a multidisciplinary approach.

It has been hypothesized that these deficits are associated with concurrent deficits in speech perception and, in turn, impaired language development. Additionally, postmortem analyses of human dyslexic brains have revealed the presence of focal neocortical malformations such as cerebrocortical microgyria. In an initial study bridging these research domains, we found that male rats with induced microgyria were impaired in discriminating rapidly presented auditory stimuli. In order to further assess this anatomical– behavioral association, we designed two experiments using auditory-reflex modification. These studies were intended to assess whether auditory processing deficits in microgyric male rats would be seen in threshold detection of a silent gap in white noise, and in oddball detection of a two-tone stimulus of variable duration. Results showed no differences between sham and microgyric subjects on gap detection, but did show that microgyric subjects were impaired in the discrimination of two-tone stimuli presented in an oddball paradigm. This impairment was evident for stimuli with total duration of 64 msec or less, while both groups were able to discriminate stimuli with duration of 89 msec or greater. The current results further support the relationship between malformations of the cerebral cortex and deficits in rapid auditory processing. They also suggest that the parameters characterizing rapid auditory processing deficits for a specific task may be influenced by stimulus features and/or cognitive demand of that particular task."

As such, this database will be referred to as the EpiSLI database. Children with SLI have unexpected and unexplained difficulties learning and using spoken language. Although there is no uniform standard for the diagnosis of SLI, the construct encompasses a language deficit occurring in the presence of grossly normal sensory and nonverbal cognitive abilities (H. Tager-Flusberg & J. Cooper, 1999). Although these language difficulties are most apparent during the preschool and early school years, evidence now exists that these problems are usually present well into adulthood and are probably present throughout a person’s life (see, for instance, C. J. Johnson et al., 1999; S. E. Stothard, M. J. Snowling, D. V. M. Bishop, B. B. Chipchase, & C. A. Kaplan, 1998; J. B. Tomblin, 2008).

Participants were 3–7-year olds enrolled in speech/language therapy (N = 185). Factor analysis of an extensive battery of speech and language measures provided support for two distinct factors, representing the skill dimensions of articulation/phonology and semantic/ syntactic skills. To validate these factors, 38 of the children were followed to school age to re-evaluate speech and language skills and assess reading/spelling achievement. The validity of the two factors was supported by their differential associations with school-age reading and spelling achievement, persistence of SSD, and affection status in family members. A closer relationship of the family member to the proband and male gender predicted higher odds of a disorder. The findings suggest that articulation/phonology and language abilities are at least partially independent in children with SSD and that these constructs have distinct clinical and biological correlates."

Being inspired by the format of standardized language tests, and based on language acquisition theories, we developed a tool named Batterie de tests de depistage approfondi (BATEDA) which combine eleven tests organized in three batteries assessing respectively modalities (BATEM), language components (BATEL) and memory (TMV). From a sample of 159 Cameroonian French-speaking four-to-fiveyears old children, the tool has been normalized using standard scores technique (the z score and the percentile). Tests have an inter-scorer reliability, an internal consistency of 96% (α de Cronbach=0,958) and a predictive validity of the primary school success of children (r=0,700). The application strategies of BATEDA aim at encouraging the screening of language delays in order to take charge of these difficulties in Cameroon by implicating teachers and parents as main participants. Among the implications of this study, we have the better knowledge of difficulties related to language delays, the better consideration of children affected, the establishment of early screening and language assessment on behalf of intervention, and a potential decrease of the rate of school abandon and expulsion of children with language delays.

Reading skills were examined descriptively and in relation to early language and literacy factors. Using stepwise regression analyses in which age and nonverbal IQ were controlled for, it was found that a single word reading measure taken at 7 years was unsurprisingly a strong predictor of the two different types of reading ability. However, even with this measure included, a receptive syntax task (TROG) entered when reading accuracy score was the DV. Furthermore, a test of expressive syntax/narrative and a receptive syntax task completed at 7 years entered into the model for word reading accuracy. When early reading accuracy was excluded from the analyses, early phonological skills also entered as a predictor of both reading accuracy and comprehension at 11 years. The group of children with a history of SLI were then divided into those with no literacy difficulties at 11 and those with some persisting literacy impairment. Using stepwise logistic regression, and again controlling for IQ and age, 7 years receptive syntax score (but not tests of phonology, expressive vocabulary or expressive syntax/narrative) entered as a positive predictor of membership of the ‘no literacy problems’ group regardless of whether early reading accuracy was controlled for in step one. The findings are discussed in relation to the overlap of SLI and dyslexia and the long term sequelae of language impairment."

Phoneme awareness represented by first sound and phoneme segmentation fluency and phonological decoding observed during nonsense word reading was poorer for the SLI group, albeit letter naming did not differ in both groups. No differences in letter naming might be explained due to intensive instruction the children with SLI are receiving in their institution of special education, while children from general population might not have this enhanced support."

We use a developmental psychopathology perspective to propose a model that integrates these explanations, and incorporates several potential moderating, mediating, and shared risk factors. We propose that temperamental negative emotionality and working memory deficits operate to initiate the pathway that may culminate in comorbid language and behaviour problems. We hypothesise that contextual factors (e.g. parent–child interactional processes) and child-specific factors (e.g. adaptive communication) may exacerbate or offset this risk and thus contribute to multiple developmental pathways.

Early deficits in RAP abilities may serve as a behavioral marker for language-based learning disabilities. The purpose of this study is to determine if performance on infant information processing measures designed to tap RAP and global processing skills differ as a function of family history of specific language impairment (SLI) and/or the particular demand characteristics of the paradigm used. Seventeen 6- to 9-month-old infants from families with a history of specific language impairment (FH+) and 29 control infants (FH ! ) participated in this study. Infants’ performance on two different RAP paradigms (head-turn procedure [HT] and auditory-visual habituation/recognition memory [AVH/RM]) and on a global processing task (visual habituation/recognition memory [VH/ RM]) was assessed at 6 and 9 months. Toddler language and cognitive skills were evaluated at 12 and 16 months. A number of significant group differences were seen: FH+ infants showed significantly poorer discrimination of fast rate stimuli on both RAP tasks, took longer to habituate on both habituation/recognition memory measures, and had lower novelty preference scores on the visual habituation/recognition memory task. Infants’ performance on the two RAP measures provided independent but converging contributions to outcome. Thus, different mechanisms appear to underlie performance on operantly conditioned tasks as compared to habituation/recognition memory paradigms. Further, infant RAP processing abilities predicted to 12- and 16month language scores above and beyond family history of SLI. The results of this study provide additional support for the validity of infant RAP abilities as a behavioral marker for later language outcome. Finally, this is the first study to use a battery of infant tasks to demonstrate multi-modal processing deficits in infants at risk for SLI."

This was followed by a replication of both regions in an additional 86 families. Both these studies applied linkage methods to one phenotypic trait at a time. However, investigations have suggested that simultaneous analysis of several traits may offer more power. The current study therefore applied a multivariate variance-components approach to the SLI Consortium dataset using additional phenotypic data. A multivariate genome scan was completed and supported the importance of the SLI1 and SLI2 loci, whilst highlighting a possible novel QTL on chromosome 10. Further investigation implied that the effect of SLI1 on non-word repetition was equally as strong on reading and spelling phenotypes. In contrast, SLI2 appeared to have influences on a selection of expressive and receptive language phenotypes in addition to non-word repetition, but did not show linkage to literacy phenotypes."

Evaluation of pre-and posttest PA performance showed differential group effects for rhyme but not alliteration. The magnitude of PA change during intervention was influenced by children's age and level of speech and language impairment. Parents provided favorable reports concerning their delivery of the intervention and demonstrated a high degree of fidelity to the task conditions. Future research directions are discussed.

The purpose was to investigate (1) whether results from the 2(1/2)-y screening were persistent at 6 y of age, and (2) what language domains at age 6 were difficult for (a) children with LD at age 2(1/2) y and (b) children with normal language (LN) at the same age. Significant differences between LD and LN at age 2(1/2) y were persistent at age 6. The vulnerability that was identified at 2(1/2) y of age, such as problems with going from single-word utterances to multi-word utterances, seems to persist as delayed development at different language levels and across language domains. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that children who failed the 2(1/2)-y screening are at high risk of having persistent language problems at age 6 y."

Fifteen 9–11-year-old children with LLD and 15 typically-developing peers read four passages containing 20 nonsense words. Word learning was assessed through oral definition and multiple-choice tasks. Variables were position of informative context, number of exposures, part of speech, and contextual clues. The LLD group scored lower than same-aged peers on oral definition (p < .001) and multiple-choice (p < .001) tasks. For both groups, there was no effect for position of informative context (p = .867) or number of exposures (p = .223). All children benefitted from contextual clues. The findings suggested difficulty inferring and recalling word meanings during reading and pointed to the need for vocabulary intervention in the upper elementary years for children with LLD."

Information collected by questionnaire showed that the GCSE grades of those whose language impairments had resolved by 5;06 were below those of age-matched controls. However, the number of GCSE examinations entered and passed was significantly more than those of the 'persistent S-LI' and 'general delay' groups. Overall, IQ was the strongest predictor of educational attainment. However, even when IQ was controlled, literacy skills accounted for independent variance in achievement, especially among those with a history of language difficulty. The survey also noted that the majority of students across all groups remained in full-time education; however, the adolescents with a background of S-LI were more likely to follow vocational and employment training courses rather than A-levels."
1,2153428858,development and disorders of neurocognitive systems for oral language and reading,2001,"james r booth, douglas d burman",learning disability quarterly,1,20,90,"Abstract. There are four goals of this article. First, a tentative neurocognitive model of oral language and reading is outlined. Second, our recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (fMRI) on the development of oral language and reading are briefly reviewed with reference to this neurocognitive model. Third, brain-imaging research on dyslexia is discussed in light of the neurocognitive model. Fourth, research on the plasticity of neural systems and the implication of this plasticity for studying normative development and disorders is presented. Reading disorder is the most common form of learning problem in the United States (estimates range from 5-15%) and, therefore, represents a biomedical issue of major importance (Shaywitz, Shaywitz, Fletcher, & Escobar, 1990). Before discussing the neural basis of reading disorders, we need to review the neural representation and development of oral language and reading. Neurocognitive Model of Oral Language and Reading Oral language and reading differ at the most basic level in terms of the nature of perceptual input (see Figure 1). In oral language, auditory input is transmitted from the medial geniculate nucleus in the thalamus to both primary auditory areas (PA) and auditory association areas (AA), the latter of which may contain phonologic representations of words (Binder et al., 1994). In written language, visual input is transmitted from the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus to primary visual areas (PV) in the striate cortex and to secondary visual areas in the extrastriate cortex (EX). From the primary visual area, information has a ventral ""what"" projection and a dorsal ""where"" projection (Mishkin, Ungerleider, & Macko, 1983). The ventral projection includes the unimodal visual area of the fusiform gyrus (FG), which may contain orthographic representations of words (Fujimaki et al., 1999; Herbster, Mintun, Nebes, & Becker, 1997; Nobre, Allison, & McCarthy, 1994). The dorsal projection includes the superior parietal lobule, which may be important in aspects of reading that involve spatial attention. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Wernicke's area (W) and surrounding areas, including angular gyrus (AG) and supramarginal gyrus (SG), are heteromodal areas that may be responsible for the integration of spoken and written word forms with arbitrary associations that give rise to meaning or semantics (Mesulam, 1998; Pugh et al., 1996). Consistent with this role, Wernicke's area is interconnected to category-specific areas in the inferior temporal lobe that appear to contain representations of faces, animals and tools (Damasio, Grabowski, Tranel, Hichwa, & Damasio, 1996; Di Virgilio & Clarke, 1997). Wernicke's area also has massive connections through the arcuate fasciculus with Broca's area (B), which tends to show later peaks of activation in language tasks (Thierry, Boulanouar, Kherif, Ranjeva, & Demonet, 1999). Broca's area includes brain regions for overt (Hagoort et al., 1999) and covert speech production of articulatory word forms involving segmented phonology (Friedman et al., 1998; Paulesu et al., 1996) as well as syntactic processing (Booth et al., 200lb; Caplan, Alpert, & Waters, 1998). The anterior temporal region (AT) is strongly interconnected with Broca's area through the uncinate fiber tract and is also implicated in syntactic processing (Mazoyer et al., 1993; Vorob'ev et al., 1998). Finally, the prefrontal cortex (PF) may be responsible for modulation of processing in posterior regions such as Wernicke's area (Frith, Friston, Liddle, & Frackowiak, 1991; Raichle et al., 1994) and/or for maintaining and manipulating verbal information in memory (Gabrieli, Desmond, Demb, Wagner et al., 1996; Jonides et al., 1997). For further details on the functional anatomy of language processing, we refer the reader to chapters in a recent edited book, which presents a critical evaluation of research that is largely consistent with the model outlined above (Hagoort, Brown, & Osterhout, 1999; Price, Indefrey, & van Turennout, 1999). …"

Previous studies have shown that children with such language impairments have moderate rates of improvement during this age range. Also, those with the most specific deficits have the greatest likelihood of improvement. Cole and colleagues have hypothesized that such results could be due to the effect of regression to the mean (K. Cole, I. Schwartz, A. Notari, P. Dale, & P. Mills, 1995). This study used a baseline measure of language that was independent of the measure used for diagnosis in order to control for factors leading to regression to the mean. Patterns of change using the kindergarten diagnostic measure were compared to those using the baseline measure. Rates of diagnostic change between kindergarten and subsequent observation intervals showed patterns of change similar to those of past research. Comparisons using the baseline measure revealed no significant change in relative language status across the 4-year time period. The results showed that when the conditions for regression to the mean were controlled, the poor language of children with language impairments was very likely to persist during the primary school years."

An unbiased appraisal of these outcomes, however, requires carefully designed, longitudinal research. Method: A group of children first identified as having speech and/or language impairment in a community-based, longitudinal study at 5 years of age and matched controls were re-examined during young adulthood (age 19). A comprehensive battery of speech and language, cognitive and achievement tests, psychiatric interviews, and questionnaires were completed by subjects, their parents and teachers. Results: While children with early speech problems showed only a few academic differences from controls in young adulthood, early language impaired (LI) young adults lagged significantly behind controls in all areas of academic achievement, even after controlling for intelligence. Further, rates of learning disabilities (LD) were significantly higher in the LI group than both the controls and community base rates. Concurrent individual difference variables, including phonological awareness, naming speed for digits, non-verbal IQ, verbal working memory, and executive function, all contributed unique variance to achievement in specific areas. Conclusion: Early LI rather than speech impairment is clearly associated with continued academic difficulties into adulthood. These results speak to the need for intensive, early intervention for LI youngsters.

In the current study, we explored one aspect of lexical storage, the hierarchical organization of the semantic system, in 13 preschoolers with word-finding deficits (WF) and 13 preschoolers with normal language abilities (ND), ranging in age from 3;3 to 6;7. The children named a series of objects at multiple levels of the noun hierarchy in response to contrast questions (e.g. for rose they were asked, ‘Is this an animal?’ to elicit plant [superordinate]; ‘Is this a tree?’ to elicit flower [basic]; ‘Is this a dandelion?’ to elicit rose [subordinate]). Both groups readily named at multiple levels, providing evidence of hierarchical organization of the lexicon. However, there were several dierences between WF and ND groups that suggested that WF children did not have enough stored information to discriminate between similar semantic neighbours. We conclude (1) that hierarchical organization of the semantic lexicon is a robust developmental phenomenon, apparent in both ND and WF preschoolers and (2) that the word-finding deficits of preschoolers appear to reflect insucient depth and breadth of storage elaboration rather than deficits in hierarchical semantic organization."
1,2157572142,persistent spatial working memory deficits in rats with bilateral cortical microgyria,2008,"r holly fitch, heather breslawski, glenn d rosen, james j chrobak",behavioral and brain functions,1,10,60,"Background: Anomalies of cortical neuronal migration (e.g., microgyria (MG) and/or ectopias) are associated with a variety of language and cognitive deficits in human populations. In rodents, postnatal focal freezing lesions lead to the formation of cortical microgyria similar to those seen in human dyslexic brains, and also cause subsequent deficits in rapid auditory processing similar to those reported in human language impaired populations. Thus convergent findings support the ongoing study of disruptions in neuronal migration in rats as a putative model to provide insight on human language disability. Since deficits in working memory using both verbal and non-verbal tasks also characterize dyslexic populations, the present study examined the effects of neonatally induced bilateral cortical microgyria (MG) on working memory in adult male rats. Methods: A delayed match-to-sample radial water maze task, in which the goal arm was altered among eight locations on a daily basis, was used to assess working memory performance in MG (n = 8) and sham (n = 10) littermates. Results: Over a period of 60 sessions of testing (each session comprising one pre-delay sample trial, and one post-delay test trial), all rats showed learning as evidenced by a significant decrease in overall test errors. However, MG rats made significantly more errors than shams during initial testing, and this memory deficit was still evident after 60 days (12 weeks) of testing. Analyses performed on daily error patterns showed that over the course of testing, MG rats utilized a strategy similar to shams (but with less effectiveness, as indicated by more errors). Conclusion: These results indicate persistent abnormalities in the spatial working memory system in rats with induced disruptions of neocortical neuronal migration."

However, it is unclear whether this result is causal in nature or whether it can be explained by difficult-to-measure heterogeneity at the community, family, or individual level. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and ordinary least squares, we show that stuttering is negatively associated with high school grades, the probability of high school graduation, and the probability of college attendance. However, empirical specifications with family fixed effects or controls for learning disabilities such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder suggest that these associations can, in large part, be explained by difficult-to-measure heterogeneity."

The two groups performed at-ceiling level on judging the sentences on their grammaticality but the ERP data revealed subtle differences between them. The P600 tended to peak later in the left posterior region in the dyslexic group compared with the control group. In addition, the group of dyslexic subjects did not show a P600 in response to sentences with a plural NP subject. These results suggest that brain activation involved in syntactic repair is more affected by linguistic complexity in developmental dyslexia compared with non-dyslexic individuals.

1,2160606436,reading disabilities among hebrew speaking children in upper elementary grades the role of phonological and nonphonological language skills,2006,r cohen mimran,reading and writing,1,8,67,"The purpose of the present study was to examine the contribution of phonological and nonphonological language skills to reading among Hebrew-speaking children with and without reading disabilities (RD) aged 10–13. We expected that the performance of children with RD would be significantly poorer in all of the language processes compared with those of chronological age-matched children with no RD. Also, we expected that nonphonological language skills would contribute unique variance to reading level. The results showed that the most marked predictor for all reading measures was the phonological awareness measure. However, nonphonological language skills also showed a significant contribution to variance in accuracy and rate of reading real words but not to variance in pseudoword reading. The discussion highlights how investigating different orthographic systems can deepen our understanding of the role of the different language processes at play in reading. Our results further stress the importance of using multi-componential reading measures (i.e., pseudowords, real words and reading rate) when analyzing the relationship between reading and language skills."

Relations of language to multiple parental report measures of functional communication, social skills, and attention problems were investigated. Difficulties in core language skills were observed, and more than 1/3 of the children struggled on at least one language index. Language abilities were significantly related to parental report of functional communication, social interaction and communication, and social skills, such that language difficulties may be a risk factor for communication and social interaction challenges and communication-related adaptive behavior in children with NF1. Though receptive language abilities were an area of particular difficulty for many children with NF1, they were not significantly related to parental ratings of social functioning and functional communication. Few significant relations were found between language and parent-reported attention problems, although some trends were noted. Hence attention difficulties in children with NF1 may contribute to, but do not appear to fully account for, language difficulties. In sum, there is an increased risk of language difficulties for young children with NF1, and lab-measured language difficulties appear to relate to everyday communication and social interaction functioning."

A broad battery of psychoacoustic measures and standard measures of reading and spelling were applied to 102 adults. The test group included individuals with a childhood history of reading difficulties and controls with no reported reading difficulties. Reading scores were variable in both groups. Poor auditory processing abilities were recorded in poor readers; particular difficulties were posed by tasks requiring spectral distinctions, the simplest of which was pure tone frequency discrimination. In absolute terms, the greatest deficits were recorded in tasks in which stimuli were presented in brief forms and in rapid succession. Auditory processing abilities accounted for more than 50% of the reading score variance in the control group, but their correlation with reading scores was lower in the group with childhood histories of reading difficulties. The additional variability in the latter group resulted largely from the prevalence of reading-compensated poor psychoacoustic performers, whose short-term word memory was also typically poor. Taken together, these findings support a link between impaired auditory resolution and poor reading. Psychoacoustic difficulties are largely retained through adulthood and may be the source of the retained reading difficulties."

1,2164309747,autism and developmental receptive language disorder a follow up comparison in early adult life ii social behavioural and psychiatric outcomes,2000,"patricia howlin, lynn mawhood, michael rutter",journal of child psychology and psychiatry,1,406,73,"This paper focuses on general social functioning in two groups of young men, one with autism and one with developmental receptive language disorders, who were first assessed at the ages of 7–8 years. At that time, although matched for nonverbal IQ (mean 92–93) and expressive language, the Language group showed significantly fewer social and behavioural problems. At follow-up, when aged on average, 23 to 24 years, the Autism group continued to show significantly more impairments in terms of stereotyped behaviour patterns, social relationships, jobs, and independence. However, problems in all these areas were also common in the Language group. Many still lived with their parents, few had close friends or permanent jobs, and ratings of social interaction indicated abnormalities in a number of different areas. On a composite measure of social competence only 10% of the Language group was assessed as having severe social difficulties compared to 74% of the Autism group. Nevertheless, 65% were rated as having moderate social problems and only 25% were rated as being of near/normal social functioning. Two individuals in the Language group, but none in the Autism group, had also developed a florid paranoid psychosis in late adolescence.

As in the follow-up of cognitive and linguistic functioning (see Mawhood et al., 2000, this volume, pp. 547–559), discriminant function analysis, which had clearly distinguished between the groups as children, now showed much greater overlap between them. Regression analysis indicated that although early language ability appeared to be related to outcome in the Autism group, there was little association between any measures of childhood functioning and prognosis in the Language group. Theoretically, these findings have implications for our understanding of the nature of autism and other pervasive language disorders, and of the relationship between them. Practically, they demonstrate the very persistent problems experienced by individuals with developmental language disorders, and their need for much greater help and support than is presently available."

We consider the heterogeneous nature of the population of children with language difficulties and provide evidence to support the view that children with specific language problems experience a variety of problems with the language system. The extent and nature of any associated literacy problems will be related to the particular domain of language processing that is compromised. The ways in which language difficulties may serve as barriers to literacy development are considered. It is argued that semantics, syntax, metalinguistic abilities and attention must be considered in addition to phonological factors if we are to develop and an accurate picture of the links between language and literacy. A dynamic model with the relative importance of different factors at different developmental stages needs to be considered."

A multiple-baseline design across behaviors assessed the effects of phonological awareness training on rhyme and letter-sound knowledge with 13 preschool children with language delays from high-poverty communities. Rhyme intervention improved children's rhyme production and rhyme identification. Initial sound intervention enhanced children's alliteration and initial sound fluency skills. These effects were replicated within and across all 13 participants. Classroom teachers perceived meaningful changes in rhyme and letter-sound production. Interventionists and teachers reported high satisfaction with the procedures. Embedding an explicit phonological awareness intervention into repeated storybook reading resulted in improved emergent literacy skills for children at high risk for reading disorders.

Speech therapy sessions require a patient to travel to a hospital or a speech therapy center for extended periods of time regularly; this makes the process of speech therapy not only time consuming but also very expensive. Additionally, there is a severe shortage of trained speech therapists around the globe in general and in developing countries in particular. In this paper, we propose a low cost mobile speech therapist, a system that enables speech therapy using a mobile phone which eliminates the need of the patient to frequently travel to a speech therapist in a far away hospital.

Comparisons focused on language samples and formalized vocabulary assessments gathered from 28 twins and 28 singletons within the Western Reserve Reading Project; the two groups were matched on age, gender, and parent education level. The children’s language samples, taken from conversational interactions, were analyzed for mean length of utterance, number of different words, number of total words, and total number of conjunctions, all of which were converted to z-scores and averaged to form a Conversational Composite. Similarly, children’s scores on the Stanford Binet Vocabulary subtest (Thorndike, Hagen, & Sattler, 1986) and the Boston Naming Test (Goodglass & Kaplan, 2001) were converted into a Formal Language Composite. Mean comparisons via t-test revealed no group differences between twins and on either of the composites. In addition to the Conversational and Formal Composites, a pilot coding process for topic initiation and management was completed for 3 twin-sibling pairs, or a total of 6 children. The topics of modeling clay, school, and hobbies emerged as the most common across transcripts. Measures related to topic management revealed consistent overlap between the two groups. Examiners, in comparison to children, initiated twice as many topic shifts. In sum, results suggest that twinship in and of itself does not indicate a substantial risk for school-age expressive language difficulties, and provide early descriptive data to analyze the transactional nature of topic management within conversational interactions."

Primero, la teoria fonologica defiende que la dislexia evolutiva se produce como consecuencia de un deficit fonologico general que afecta a diversos componentes del sistema fonologico, entre los que destacan la conciencia fonologica, la velocidad de los procesos lexicos y la memoria verbal a corto plazo. Segundo, la teoria fonologica ha puesto de manifiesto que la causa primaria de la dislexia esta presente desde el periodo embrionario y produce consecuencias sobre el desarrollo del lenguaje oral durante todo el periodo previo al aprendizaje de la lectura. Tercero, la teoria fonologica ha defendido la tesis del lenguaje oral como causa primaria del deficit, y con ello ha revelado las relaciones entre los trastornos especificos del lenguaje y la dislexia evolutiva.

1,2278572307,the development of reading which factors play a role,2010,crysten melissa skebo,NA,0,0,44,"by: CRYSTEN MELISSA SKEBO Factors that have been used to predict reading competence vary widely from study to study. Phonological awareness is a well-documented factor in reading development, but other skills such as oral language, IQ, vocabulary, and verbal working memory also have been shown to play a role. This study examined the relationship between cognitive skills (expressive and receptive language, phonological awareness, Performance IQ, vocabulary, and verbal memory) and reading (decoding and comprehension) at three different stages of reading development: Early Elementary, Middle School, and High School. Results showed that different cognitive skills predict reading ability at different ages and to differing degrees. Vocabulary as measured by standardized assessments was found to be a better predictor of reading than vocabulary in conversation. 4 The Development of Reading: Which Factors Play a Role? Reading is an important component of literacy that is essential for functioning in our society. The National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL), most recently conducted in 2003, found that 30 million American adults aged 16 and older scored at the “Below Basic” level of literacy. This means that 14 percent of the adult population was only proficient in the most simple and concrete literacy skills, such as signing a form or reading simple instructions about what to drink before a medical procedure (Baer, Kutner, & Sabatini, 2009). Of these 30 million, 7 million were functionally illiterate in English (Baer et al., 2009). With the inception of the No Child Left Behind Act (2001) and programs created within it such as Reading First and Early Reading First, the U.S. Department of Education has made reading education a priority (White & Dillow, 2005). Speech-Language Pathologists have become increasingly involved in the prevention and remediation of reading disorders due to the link between reading disabilities and oral language skills (Catts, Fey, Zhang, & Tomblin, 2001). However, oral language is just one of the numerous factors that influence a child’s reading ability. Not enough is known about the many factors that predict reading abilities at different ages and how these variables change with development. I. Components of Reading In order to understand why different factors can be used to predict reading, one must first have a general understanding of the components of reading and how they develop. Reading is a “complex cognitive activity” that is not easily defined (Catts & Kamhi, 2005, p. 3). Gough and colleagues divide reading into two main components in 5 the simple view of reading: decoding and linguistic comprehension (Gough & Tunmer, 1986; Hoover & Gough, 1990). Decoding refers to the process of translating printed words into sounds, while linguistic comprehension is the process used to interpret words, sentences, and discourse (Gough & Tunmer, 1986). The comprehension process relies on vocabulary and higher-level cognitive abilities. Another view of reading, the broad view, also includes higher-level cognitive processes, such as thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving (Perfetti, 1986). This paper will focus on three major components of reading: decoding, comprehension, and vocabulary. II. Developmental Trajectory of the Components of Reading A. General Reading Development Since there is much individual variation in the timing and the method in which children learn to read, it is difficult to adequately describe the development of reading in a manner that is universally applicable to all children. Stage theories have commonly been used to describe the process of reading development, though the required number of stages needed to attain proficiency in reading differs according to theorist. However, the different theories of reading development include common skills that must be present in order for a child to become a mature and fluent reader. Chall’s Stages of Reading Development (1983) are widely known and describe how reading develops throughout the lifespan. Prereading, or Stage 0, can be described as the “emergent literacy” phase. In this stage, children are exposed to print, learn graphemes, and memorize labels and signs in their environment (Chall, 1983). The Decoding Stage (Stage 1) includes the development of skills such as phoneme-grapheme 6 correspondence and knowledge and use of the alphabetic principle. The next stage, Fluency (Stage 2), involves an integration of the skills learned in the first two stages. The child now uses context and semantic knowledge along with decoding skills to identify unfamiliar words (Chall, 1983). Learning the New, or Stage 3, has also been referred to as the transition from “learning to read” to “reading to learn”. In this stage, children are able to use reading as a tool for learning new information, and their vocabularies and cognitive abilities are continuing to develop and grow (Chall, 1983). Stage 4, Multiple Viewpoints, describes the refining of children’s reading skills as they become able to read and comprehend complex information. Finally, Stage 5, Construction and Reconstruction, describes the reading of most adults, who read for the purpose of learning or pleasure (Chall, 1983). Chall (1983) assigned a “reading grade level” to each of these stages of reading development: Stage 0 is before first grade; Stage 1 takes place in grades 1 and the beginning of 2; Stage 2 is grade levels 2 and 3; Stage 3 is grades 4 through 8; Stage 4 is high school (grades 9 through 12); and Stage 5 is college-level and beyond. However, it is important to note that not all people develop reading in the same manner or at the same time; therefore, these reading stages may be achieved beyond the grade level that is typically associated with them. For example, an adult may be in Stage 2 of reading development and be reading material that has the complexity of what would typically be presented to children in grades 2 and 3. The ability of a person, whether adult or child, to master reading, depends on individual and environmental factors, including such things as disabilities, education, and home and community influences (Chall, 1987). 7 B. Reading Decoding and Word Recognition Catts and Kamhi (2005) have summarized Chall’s stages along with theories of reading development by Ehri and McCormick (1998) and Frith (1985). They describe reading as consisting of the development of word recognition skills, along with development of comprehension skills. Word recognition is divided into 3 stages that must occur before the child can automatically recognize words: Logographic, Alphabetic, and Orthographic/Automatic Word Recognition (Catts & Kamhi, 2005). The Logographic Stage is a visual stage in which a child memorizes the way a word looks and “reads” it without using knowledge of phoneme-grapheme correspondence. However, this stage is controversial, and studies have found that logographic reading is not related to later reading proficiency (Share & Stanovich, 1995). Therefore, children do not need to become skilled at logographic reading before they can learn to read phonetically (Catts & Kamhi, 2005). The hallmark characteristic of the Alphabetic Stage is the development of the ability to read using phoneme-grapheme correspondence (Catts & Kamhi, 2005). Children use this skill in order to decode unfamiliar words. In order to accomplish this, children must first have an understanding of the alphabetic principle (knowledge that letters and combinations of letters represent sounds used in spoken language). Learning to decode words is a complicated process, since the sounds produced in the English language do not always correspond exactly to graphemes, and there are many sounds that can be represented by more than one grapheme (Catts & Kamhi, 2005; Sanders, 2001). In order to become successful decoders, children must learn the allophonic variations of 8 phonemes and understand the effects of coarticulation in spoken words (Catts & Kamhi, 2005). The final stage, the Orthographic/Automatic Word Recognition Stage, occurs when the child can visually recognize words without having to decode them (Ehri, 1991; Frith, 1985). This is accomplished with the help of semantic memory. As children decode words, they begin to recognize letter patterns and store them in their memories; therefore, a child cannot master this stage of reading without mastery of phonological decoding (Ehri, 1991). Once the child has stored these mental representations of words, he/she can rely on memory to read (“sight reading”) instead of decoding each word, which improves comprehension (Apel & Swank, 1999). However, the ability to phonologically decode is never completely forgotten; adults still use these skills to read unfamiliar words (Catts & Kamhi, 2005). C. Reading Comprehension Before a child is able to efficiently decode and recognize words, he/she has a stronger understanding of spoken language than written language (Catts & Kamhi, 2005). However, when a child develops the ability to automatically recognize words and no longer needs to decode everything, he/she can focus more intently on the meaning of the text he/she is reading and use reading to gain knowledge (Verhoeven & Van Leeuwe, 2008). This is the “reading to learn” stage, described in Chall’s stage 3, where children begin gaining information regarding concepts, facts, and instructions from text (Chall, 1983). Word recognition is not the only skill that must be in place before a child can truly comprehend what he/she reads. Readers also rely on vocabulary, as well as 9 cognitive skills such as reasoning, problem-solving, and abstract thinking (Catts & Kamhi, 2005). The process of developing reading comprehension skills is not linear, and the necessary linguistic and cognitive skills required to be successful in this area are difficult to measure quantitatively (Catts & Kamhi, 2005)."

In order to do so, the results of the Otago screening protocol were compared with those of comprehensive language assessment as determined by best practice protocol (Gillon & Schwarz, 1998, Kennedy, 2002). Following the completion of the screening and the comprehensive assessments, an evaluation of the true positives and false positives was calculated, and an analysis of the false negative outcomes made. Findings indicated that fourteen of the twenty participants were true positives, three were true negatives, three were false positives, and none were false negatives. The Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value of the screening protocol was 100%. Test Sensitivity and Specificity were very high at 82% and 100%. Interrater reliability was very high, generally ranging from 92-100%. Adding a standardised measure of phonological awareness would improve efficiency of the screening protocol. Consideration of alternative screening tools, such as the GAPS test (Gardner et al, 2006) and the CELF-4 screening test (Semel, Secord & Wiig, 2004), should be made. Additional factors which could influence a screening protocol are discussed. The Otago screening protocol is a valid procedure to detect severe speech and language impairments in school-aged students referred to Special Education."

This ability that starts early in the preschool years with the recognition of rhymes, allows the manipulation of audible segments of increasing complexity, finally reaching the phoneme. Various Neuropsychologic studies have shown a close relation between defective phonologic awareness and reading learning disabilities. Neurophysiologic evaluations in dyslexics have shown functional differences in brain areas related to language, as compared to normal subjects. Genetic studies in dyslexics with impaired phonologic awareness have shown abnormalities in chromosomes 6 and 3. Phonologic awareness intervention is proposed as a preventive measure in preschool children and as a therapeutic instrument in older children and adults. These findings shed doubt on the present definitions and clasifications of learning disabilities as presented in DSM IV and ICD 10."

But continuing deficits in spoken language skills have led to challenges in meeting those expectations. This study was conducted to (1) examine two kinds of language skills (phonological and morphosyntactic) at school age (second grade) for children with cochlear implants (CIs); (2) see which measures from earlier in life best predicted performance at second grade; (3) explore how well these skills supported other cognitive and language functions; and (4) examine how treatment factors affected measured outcomes. NA NA NA Methods NA Data were analyzed from 100 second-grade, monolingual English-speaking children: 51 with CIs and 49 with normal hearing (NH).

However, while several studies have examined the relationship between language delay and reading impairment, relatively few have focused on spelling. In this study, spelling performance of 28 children with developmental dyslexia (DD), 14 children with a history of language delay (LD) and 14 children without (NoLD) and 28 control participants were examined. Spelling was investigated by writing a dictation task that included orthographically regular stimuli (word and nonwords), as well as words with unpredictable transcription. Results indicated that all dyslexic participants underperformed compared to controls on both regular and unpredictable transcription stimuli, but LD performance was generally the worst. Moreover, spelling impairment assumed different characteristics in LD and NoLD children. LD children were more sensitive to acoustic-to-phonological variables, showing relevant failure especially on stimuli containing geminate consonants but also on polysyllabic stimuli and those containing non-continuant consonants. Error analysis confirmed these results, with LD children producing a higher rate of phonological errors respect to NoLD children and controls. Results were coherent with the hypothesis that among dyslexic children, those with previous language delay have more severe spelling deficit, suffering from defective orthographic lexical acquisition together with long-lasting phonological difficulties."

This research paper reviews the literature regarding the relationship between the skill of phonemic segmentation and EFL word recognition. It addresses three main issues: the position of phonemic segmentation skill in literature, the relation between phonological awareness and ability to read, and the skill of word recognition and learning to read. The aim of this paper is to precisely explore the nature of the relation of phonemic segmentation skill and beginning readers’ word recognition. The leading research question for this paper is: What is the relationship between the skill of phonemic segmentation and beginning readers’ EFL word recognition? To answer the research question, the researcher will review literature to explore that relation. The researcher will conclude that the relationship between the skill of phonemic segmentation and word recognition has received substantial concern in literature.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of speech and language delay in children less than three years old, using the Langauge Evaluation Scale Trivandrum (LEST 0-3). Materials andMethods: A descriptive, cross sectional study was conducted in the under-five clinic of our institute, on a sample of 200 children, less than three years old. Language was assessed using Language Evaluation Scale Trivandrum (LEST 0-3) and development in other domains was assessed using the Trivandrum Development Screening Chart (TDSC). The Home Screening Questionnaire (HSQ) was used to assess the home environment. Various biological and environmental risk factors were analyzed. Results: The prevalence of speech and language delay was found to be 27%. In univariate analysis, parameters found to be significantly associated with speech and language delay were male gender, poor home environment (score = 19 in the Home Screening Questionnaire) and family history of speech and language delay. In multivariate analysis, poor home environment (CI NA 0.20 0.80, P NA 0.01) and positive family history (CI NA 0.09 0.72, P NA 0.01) were significant risk factors. There was a significant association between delay in TDSC and speech delay. However, TDSC alone had a low sensitivity of 33% in detecting speech and language delay. Conclusions: Prevalence of speech and language delay is high (27%) in children less than three years of age attending the UnderFive clinic for at-risk children. Negative home environment and family history of speech and language disorders are significant risk factors for speech and language delay. The strong association of speech delay with delay in TDSC reemphasizes the need for a complete developmental assessment in any child with speech delay. The TDCS alone fails to detect significant number of cases of speech delay, showing the need to perform a separate speech screening test."

Some experts have suggested that debating what to call language disorders is parallel to debating what to call reading disorders and dyslexia. In contrast, it is argued here that reading disorders are language disorders and not separate or parallel. Evidence is presented for quadrant models that explain language disorders and dyslexia along two dimensions—sound/word level (phonological) knowledge and sentence/discourse level (non-phonological) knowledge. Support for these two dimensions comes from factor analysis of a new assessment tool called the Test of Integrated Language and Literacy Skills (TILLS). Two case studies illustrate how a quadrant model can be used to explain patterns of abilities that vary along these two dimensions to parents and teachers. The article conclud..."

The scores and error types in the sub-tasks by two presentations were compared to each other. Also, the correlation between the performances of phonemic awareness sub-tasks in two presentation conditions were examined. As a result, 6-year-old group showed significantly higher phonemic awareness scores than 5-year-old group. Both group showed significantly higher scores in visual presentation than auditory presentation. While the performance under the visual presentation was significantly lower especially in the segmentation than the other two tasks, there was no significant difference among sub-tasks under the auditory presentation. 5-year-old group showed significantly more `no response` errors than 6-year-old group and 6-year-old group showed significantly more `phoneme substitution` and `phoneme omission` errors than 5-year-old group. Significantly more `phoneme omission` errors were observed in the segmentation than the elision task, and significantly more `phoneme addition` errors were observed in elision than the synthesis task. Lastly, there are positive correlations in auditory and visual synthesis tasks, auditory and visual elision tasks, and auditory and visual segmentation tasks. Summarizing the results, children tend to depend on orthographic knowledge when acquiring the initial phonemic awareness. Therefore, the result of this research would support the position that the orthographic knowledge affects the improvement of phonemic awareness."

Second, fMRI studies in neurotypical adults implicate corticostriatal and hippocampal systems in language learning.

One explanation for the traditionally reported reading achievement plateau when students are D/HH is the inability to hear insalient English morphology.

The authors investigated the English morphological and syntactic abilities and reading achievement of elementary and middle school students at a school using simultaneously spoken and signed Standard American English facilitated by intentional listening, speech, and language strategies. A developmental trend (and no plateau) in language and reading achievement was detected; most participants demonstrated average or above-average English.

1,2520831803,exploring literacy development in children with specific language impairment a prospective longitudinal study,2012,ellen vandewalle,NA,0,0,80,"Early detection and treatment of dyslexia have attracted much attention in our society. Children with dyslexia experience severe reading and/or spelling problems, which have an influence on their school and career development and their daily life. On the other hand, until now specific language impairment (SLI) is less known by teachers and parents. However, the prevalence of SLI is similar to dyslexia (around 7%). Children with SLI have persistent oral language problems that may be present in different language domains, such as deficits with semantics, morphosyntax, phonology and pragmatics. These children are at high risk to develop dyslexia later on. The overlap between both disorders seems higher than expected, but the amount of the overlap and the causes remain unclear. In daily practice, speech-language therapists have the experience that a number of children with SLI develop dyslexia, but surprisingly also a number of children with SLI do not have problems with word reading and spelling skills. In typically developing children, a number of good predictors for dyslexia have been demonstrated. However, it is unknown whether the same predictors are apparent in children with SLI. It is hard to predict which individual child with SLI is at high risk of developing literacy problems. The purpose of the present dissertation was to analyze the development of different skills important for literacy development in order to find good predictors for literacy delay in children with SLI. Therefore, a longitudinal study was performed in which children with SLI and children of a control group were followed from the last year of kindergarten until the start of grade 3. A whole range of tests was administered yearly measuring phonological, other oral language and literacy skills. Moreover, temporal auditory processing and speech perception were measured once in grade 1. For all these skills, a group of children with SLI and literacy delay was compared to a group of children with SLI and normal literacy and to a control group. These group comparisons revealed that both SLI groups had lower scores compared to the control group for phonological awareness and verbal short-term memory: in the SLI group with literacy delay these lower scores remained until grade 3, while in the SLI group with normal literacy the scores were only persistently lower for more demanding phonological awareness and verbal short-term memory tasks.

While the previous theory predicts the relatively spared performance of children with SLI (CwSLI) on syntactic morphology in morphologically complex languages, the latter predicts a diametrically opposite performance. Data from a group of 15 Kannada-speaking CwSLI supported the morphological richness theory, and further revealed five distinct profiles of SLI. The results of this study reflected that CwSLI learning the agglutinative language (Kannada) as compared with language-matched children without SLI, displayed some shared deficits (e.g., in phonological processing on a non-word repetition task) with CwSLI learning English. However, CwSLI learning the morphosyntactically rich language Kannada differed remarkably from English-learning CwSLI by not showing deficits in syntactic morphology relative to language-matched peers (e.g., PNG, verb, tense, case, and pronoun)."

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of combined risperidone (RIS) and pivotal response treatment (PRT) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).




Design/methodology/approach




In all, 34 children diagnosed with ASD (mean age of 12.36 years) were randomly divided into two groups: an RIS treatment group (n=18) and an RIS plus PRT (n=16). Communication skills were evaluated with the child communication checklist (CCC).




Findings




Total score of the CCC was increased in both groups after three months compared with the score prior to treatment. The total score of the CCC was significantly higher in the combined treatment group than in the RIS group.




Originality/value




Treatment with RIS combined with PRT may result in a better outcome in communication skill for children with autism than RIS training alone."

Analyses indicate that the negative association between redshirting (delayed kindergarten entry) as a student later identified as having a disability varies across students with different types of disability. For most disability designations, achievement outcomes were substantially lower for redshirted students compared to students with the same designation who enrolled in kindergarten on time. This supports the hypothesis that schools may provide young children with better access to early identification and intervention services, which outweigh the benefits of maturation experiences during the redshirt year. However, redshirted students with speech–language impairments had slightly higher achievement compared with students with speech–language impairments who entered on time. Study findings suggest that young children with disabilities may benefit from entering kindergarten when first eligible."

We test the hypothesis that early speech production will be associated with children’s later letter identification. We examined longitudinal growth in early speech production in 9 typically developing children across eight occasions, every 3 months from 9 months to 30 months. At each occasion, participants and their caregivers engaged in a speech sample in a research lab. This speech sample was transcribed for a variety of vocalizations, which were then transformed to calculate consonant-vowel ratio. Consonant-vowel ratio is a measure of phonetic complexity in speech production. At the age of 72 months, children’s letter knowledge was measured. A multilevel model including fixed quadratic age change and a random intercept was estimated using letter identification as a predictor of the growth in early speech production from 9–30 months, measured by the outcome of consonant-vowel ratio. Results revealed that the relation between early speech production and letter identification differed over time. For each additional letter that a child identified, their consonant-vowel ratio at the age of 9 months increased. As such, these results confirmed our hypothesis: more robust early speech production is associated with more accurate letter identification."

Owing to their average intelligence and otherwise age-appropriate behavior, be it in school or in home, their poor performance is perceived as their lack of volition and the root of the problem is overlooked. Specific Language Impairment (SLI) or Disorder of language acquisition is another condition that overlaps with SLD due to their shared deficit in underlying cognitive processes with an adverse impact on academic performance. Lack of awareness of the community and the teachers about SLD and SLI delays the diagnosis in India. Though SLI is more readily identifiable, it is not timely referred. The problem is further complicated as students here are quite often exposed to English or Hindi or the state official language as their medium of instruction in school, irrespective of their mother tongue. India being multilingual country, experts face problem in developing a common tool for its assessment and identification all over the country. Considering the heterogeneity of the group, the child’s standing on the domains of cognition, language, perceptual-motor, and scholastic skills together can help in understanding this disability condition. Another important issue is the delay in legal recognition of SLD. The new Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 promises to provide all the required services to the disabled population but its objective implementation is not very clear. Present chapter takes an attempt with case examples to address the importance of early detection of the SLD and SLI as early certification helps these children to receive all the assistance legally due to them and enables them to pursue their study by overcoming their limitation."

Disorder (hereafter children with DDLD) perform poorly on phonological tasks
compared to typically developing (TD) children. However, there has been some
debate as to whether their phonological deficit arises directly from an impairment in
phonological representations, or instead from deficient access to (intact) phonological
representations. This study tested the Degraded Phonological Representations
Hypothesis and the Deficient Phonological Access Hypothesis using a task that is not
often used with children with DDLD, namely phonological fluency. Both hypotheses
predict that children with DDLD will retrieve fewer items than their TD peers in the
phonological fluency task. However, while the Degraded Phonological Representations
Hypothesis predicts smaller clusters of phonologically related items in children with
DDLD, the Deficient Phonological Access Hypothesis predicts that the two groups will
not differ in cluster size. How phonological fluency performance related to children’s
language, literacy, and phonological skills was investigated. Further, the specificity of a
phonological fluency deficit in children with DDLD was tested using a nonverbal (design)
fluency task. Sixty-six children with DDLD aged 7–12 years and 83 TD children aged
6–12 years, all monolingual Greek speakers, were tested on three phonological fluency
categories, on nonverbal IQ, language, literacy, and phonological tasks, and on a design
fluency task. The DDLD group produced significantly fewer correct responses and fewer
switches compared to the TD group, but the two groups showed similar clustering
and average cluster size. After controlling for age, children’s language, literacy, and
phonological skills significantly predicted the number of correct responses produced.
The two groups did not differ significantly on the number of unique designs generated in
the design fluency task. Furthermore, children with DDLD showed poorer phonological fluency performance relative to their TD peers even after design fluency performance was controlled, demonstrating the specificity of their phonological fluency deficit. This study adds to the theoretical debate on the locus of the phonological deficit in dyslexia
and DLD. The findings support the hypothesis that the phonological deficit in dyslexia
and DLD lies in deficient explicit access to intact phonological representations."

Taylor Studies have examined the impact of parents’ educational level on their child’s emergent literacy skills and have found positive associations (Korat, 2009). However, a review of the literature indicates that previous studies have not investigated whether parents’ oral and written language skills relate to their child’s emergent oral and written language skills. This is important in light of the fact that parents’ educational level does not provide a complete picture of their academic skills (Greenberg, 1995). In addition to parental characteristics, the home literacy environment (HLE) is seen as important in the growth of children’s emergent literacy skills (Hood, Conlon, & Andrews, 2008). The two studies in this investigation explored the relationships among parental oral and written language skills, the HLE, and preschoolers’ emergent literacy skills. Both studies included 96 parent-child dyads. The first study examined the relationship between parents’ oral and written language skills and their preschoolers’ oral and written language skills. All participants were assessed on various oral and written language measures. Descriptive analyses, one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), correlations, and regressions were conducted to assess the relationships between the parent skills and child skills. Most of the parental skills were found to have a relationship with the child skills. The second study extended the first study by examining the relationships between parental responses on a Home Literacy Environment Survey (HLES) and Title Recognition Test (TRT) of children’s books, parental characteristics (educational level and oral and written language skills), and children’s emergent literacy skills. Descriptive analyses, one-way ANOVA, correlations, and regressions were employed to gain information about the relationships among the variables. The HLE (measured by responses to the HLES and TRT) had positive relationships with parents’ skills and children’s skills. However, the HLE did not predict the children’s skills beyond the contribution of parental characteristics. Interpreting the results of this study promotes thought about the specific role of the HLE as a potential mediator between parental characteristics and child skills. Altogether, both studies provide preliminary information about parental factors that may influence preschoolers’ emergent literacy skills.

A secondary data analysis is performed on the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation study public use file, in which cognitive development is measured using the Bayley Mental Development Index and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Household income is measured as a percentage of the federal poverty level, with households earning up to 100 percent of the poverty level annually considered low income. Mother’s education is determined by possession of a high school diploma. Results of multiple and simultaneous linear regressions are presented. Early Head Start is found to positively affect cognitive development among children whose mothers have earned a high school diploma, while its effectiveness for low income households is less significant. Implications for early childhood interventions are discussed, as well as areas for future research. Introduction When we speak of early child development we speak broadly of both cognitive and social/behavioral development in the first three years of life. We are concerned presently with cognitive development, which is characterized primarily by the development of language and pattern recognition (Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). The extent to which these cognitive abilities are expressed at an early age has implications for cognitive development throughout elementary school and beyond. Children with more advanced cognitive functioning relative to their peers prior to elementary school go on to perform better in school (Blachman, 1984; Blatchford & Plewis, 1990). Importantly, research suggests cognitive development is not achieved at the same rate or to the same extent equally among all children. Numerous studies (Duncan et al, 1994; Entwisle & Alexander, 1995; Korenman et al, 1995; Blau, 1999; Fazio et al, 1996; To et al, 2004; Phipps & Lethbridge 2006) have indicated that household income, or the income"

Examination of the early and emergent literacy research shows that there are both broad and narrow definitions of early literacy. Broad definitions are useful because they help us keep sight of long-term goals, as well as view the child as a whole. Narrow definitions are also useful because they allow us to understand pathways of development, as well as the relations among different child behaviors and child knowledge. Herein, a narrow definition of early literacy is proposed and the advantages of such a definition for assessing child behaviors are discussed (Senechal, LeFevre, Smith-Colton, & Colton, 2001)."

Additionally, a high frequency of reading to children in early childhood positively affects their own reading behavior. However, differences in reading in early childhood appear to be unrelated to school marks in the subject of German language at the end of primary school.

There are important literacy skill sets for children to acquire to be competent readers. The 2009 National Early Literacy Panel has defined one of these skills as alphabetic knowledge (Bell & Westberg, 2009). Alphabetic knowledge is being able to recognize and name letters and their sounds. The research shows that mastery of alphabetic skills is required before children can engage successfully in phonemic awareness. (Bara, Gentaz & Cole, 2007). Parents can facilitate their child’s mastery of these skills through activities that can be integrated into play and their child’s daily schedule. Educators can provide resources and support for learning these skills through a school-to-home connection. This is invaluable to students who may be at-risk because of disabilities, being an English Language Learner, or living in a low-literacy or poverty home. This project provides a literature review of emergent literacy skills and the need for support of at-risk students.

We go on to test whether these associations are moderated by maternal reading ability. Results suggest that the degree of household order is significantly and positively associated with the expressive vocabulary, Woodcock Reading Mastery, and phonological awareness skills of children whose mothers are above-average readers. By contrast, the number of books a child owns or brings home and how often a child amuses self alone with books are significantly asso- ciated with the expressive vocabulary, Woodcock Reading Mastery, and phono- logical awareness skills of children whose mothers are average-ability readers.

The data sources for this investigation included interview responses and a demographic survey. Data from 17 parents, each from a different household, and each with a child in kindergarten were obtained and used for the study. For analyses of these data, content analysis was used to identify similar themes among the interview responses and the demographic survey. Results indicated the following: (1) the time parents spent assisting their child with literacy activities was affected by long work hours, (2) parents with a yearly income of $25,000 or less were unable to provide additional literacy materials for their children, (3) lack of multicultural literature caused culturally diverse parents to feel devalued, and (4) parents who did not speak English fluently lacked the strategies to assist their children in completing English literacy homework. The findings suggest there are significant factors in the home environment that impact the quality and amount of literacy activities that parents provide for their children.

One hundred seventy-seven Chinese children were followed from Grade 1 to Grade 2 and were assessed on reading and mathematics. Their parents also responded to a questionnaire assessing the frequency of engaging in different home literacy and numeracy activities. Results showed that reading ability in Grade 1 negatively predicted informal home literacy activities in Grade 2. In turn, mathematics ability in Grade 1 negatively predicted formal home numeracy activities in Grade 2. Neither parents’ SES nor child's gender moderated any of the observed cross-lagged relationships. These findings suggest first that different facets of the home learning environment may relate to reading and mathematics in Chinese. Second, once children go to Grade 1, the relationship between home learning environment and academic achievement becomes unidirectional: early reading/mathematics ability predicts future home literacy/numeracy activities and the effect is negative. This suggests that parents engage more frequently in home activities when they notice that their children experience difficulties in reading or mathematics. However, it is also possible that parents change their teaching in order to be in accord with the expectations of the school system."
1,570217295,the relationship between working memory and reading comprehension in l1 arabic and l2 english for arabic speaking children,2014,h m elsayyad,NA,0,0,149,"This mixed methodology research project comprised four studies that explored relationships between working memory and literacy, as well as the potential influence of home literacy, in L1 Arabic and L2 English children in grade six (aged 11) of mainstream Kuwaiti schools (N = 44 to 99). Quantitative studies 1 to 3 investigated these potential relationships using measures of working memory, literacy, phonological skills and vocabulary. Study 3 also contrasted vowelized and non-vowelized Arabic. Study 4 combined findings from approximately 70 completed parental questionnaires about home literacy background with qualitative data from four parental interviews, and compared these data with their children’s scores on working memory, literacy and vocabulary.
Findings from studies 1 to 3 suggested that L1 and L2 literacy development can be predicted by working memory after controlling for word reading and vocabulary; and, in the case of Arabic, both vowelized and non-vowelized text showed relationships with working memory. Additionally, Arabic listening span and Arabic backward digit span were predictors of comprehension in L2 English, whereas only listening span predicted comprehension in L1 Arabic. Data indicated that the association between L1 working memory and L2 comprehension was dependent upon L2 language competence. Findings from study 4 also argue for influences on literacy and language skills of the child’s background, including cultural activities associated with upbringing and parental attitudes towards learning and literacy.
Overall, similar predictors emerged for English and Arabic literacy skills arguing for these orthographies to rely on common processes. However, there is a need for further development of working memory measures for Arabic contexts to ensure that these measures assess skills appropriately, and for a consideration of parental influences on learning. Educators should consider both cognitive and sociocultural factors as foundations for teaching literacy, and support the establishment of communication routes between parents and schools"

ISBN 978-951-39-4712-5 (PDF) This dissertation focuses on the predictive relations between parental home-based involvement in children’s schooling and the development of children’s reading and math skills in kindergarten and in the first two years of primary school (i.e., elementary school). The dissertation investigates (1) the extent to which children’s emergent literacy or emergent numeracy skills in kindergarten and in primary school would predict parental home-based involvement; and (2) to what extent parents’ home-based involvement in their children’s learning during kindergarten and during primary school would predict the subsequent development of their children’s academic skills. Additionally, (3) the antecedents of parental involvement and the antecedents of children’s academic skills were investigated. The present thesis is based on two data sets. The first of these stems from the Jyvaskyla Entrance into Primary School study, in which 207 children and their parents were followed up during the children’s transition from kindergarten to primary school. The second data set is part of the First Steps study, in which circa 2,000 children and their mothers and fathers participated. The mothers and fathers of both data sets completed questionnaires concerning their home-based involvement in the middle of their children’s kindergarten year as well as during the subsequent first and second school year. Children’s skills were assessed at the beginning and the end of kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2. The results showed that parental home-based involvement was related differently to children’s skills in kindergarten and primary school. (1) In kindergarten, the better word reading and math skills children showed, the more teaching of reading, shared reading and teaching of math their parents reported having given. However, in Grade 1, it was children’s poor skills in reading and math that activated parents’ teaching of reading, shared reading, and teaching of math. Similarly, the worse reading and math skills children showed at the beginning of Grade 1, the more monitoring and help parents reported to be giving later on. Overall, the results suggest that mothers and fathers adjust their teaching to the actual skill level of their children when their children enter primary school. The results show further that (2) of the reading-related activities, mothers’ teaching of reading was the best predictor of the development of reading skills among kindergarten children. However, starting in Grade 1, parental involvement was less beneficial for the development of children’s reading and math skills. The additional results showed that (3) the lower the socioeconomic status of mothers and fathers, the more teaching of reading and math they reported to be giving. Also, the results further demonstrate that girls (vs. boys), firstborns (vs. later-borns), and children with more highly educated mothers are more likely to become good readers by the end of the kindergarten year."

The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn about the emergent literacy experiences of one Libyan American preschooler and one Syrian American preschooler and how their families support these experiences in their bilingual homes. Through the lens of social theory of learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998) and sociocultural theory (Rogoff, 1990; Vygotsky, 1978), this multi-case study was designed to explore family literacy practices with a preschooler in a naturalistic setting. The questions guiding this study were: (1) How did the texts, tools, and technologies available in two bilingual home settings impact the emergent literacy practices of a Libyan American child and a Syrian American child? (2) What support did family members provide for these two children as they developed emergent literacy practices in their bilingual home settings? Data sources included a demographic questionnaire, digital-recordings of family literacy practices with a preschooler, audio-recorded in-depth interviews with the parents, home visits, the preschoolers’ writing samples, and photographs of literacy activities, materials, and the home environment. The recorded family literacy practices and interviews were transcribed and analyzed to identify emerging themes. Both within-case analysis and cross-case analysis were conducted. Findings revealed that the preschoolers in both families use a multimodal process such as talking, drawing, singing, chanting, recitation, technologies, and sociodramatic play in their daily literacy experiences. The parents are not concerned with teaching their children specific literacy skills; but they naturally use techniques for keeping them on task and questioning skills to enhance oral language and comprehension development. These families’ home literacy practices are Americanized by living in the mainstream social group, and English is frequently used among the family members. However, their bilingualism and religious literacy practices enrich and vary their children’s emergent literacy experiences and their family literacy practices. The significance of this study resides in the importance of getting to know individual families’ backgrounds to better understand and respect the cultural practices of family literacy.

The thesis investigates the connection between two larger fields of research; language maintenance and ethnic identity affiliation. Previously, research investigated one area or the other. After initial interviews with the family members it was determined from investigation into past exposure and present participation in the various practices of both ethnic identity and language maintenance that deeper investigation needed to occur. Finally, it was determined that in the prior research none had examined differences between family members and reasons for these variations. 


The thesis presents an ethnographic comparative case study analysis of three Nepalese families using a three-tiered macro, micro, and internal theoretical framework in conjunction with a newly redefined acculturation continuum. Observation, which was participatory, occurred in various contexts during a nine month period. In conjunction with these observation sessions, semi-structured interviews regarding present participation in language maintenance and ethnic identity practices, and historical narrative interviews investigating prior exposure to home country, ethnic, cultural, and social literacy practices occurred. In addition, data analysis from the observations used a language maintenance practice checklist based on three types of practices (social language, social literacy, and peripheral ritualised practices) thus discovering whether shifts or loss occurred in families. This analysis revealed a newly termed practice of peripheral ritualised practices. Furthermore, observations discovered that it was not only exposure to home country experience and ethnic customs which play a significant role in shaping social and ethnic identity construction but more informatively the age of exposure. Consequently, the researcher was able to examine not only shifts from children via pre-adolescences to teens, but to assess differences between siblings, an area that had previously not been researched. NA Finally, the study noted that for children, pre-adolescence and adolescences there is a balance between globalised practices and ethnic practices which need further future investigation."

However, contextual cues may draw young children's attention away from the print, thus questioning the value of environmental print in early reading development. Eye tracker technology was used to measure the extent that children attend to words in environmental print. The relationships between print fixations and letter and word knowledge, as well as differences in fixations across types of environmental print, were also examined. Preschool children (N = 39) ages 3–5 years viewed photographs of nine environmental print items and their standard print equivalents while visual fixations were recorded. Children were found to attend to words in environmental print, although they showed more and longer fixations for standard print words without contextual cues. Children's fixations were not associated with print knowledge. However, fixations on words in environmental print varied by item type to suggest that print learning may be facilitated by using environmental print with larger and more centralized fonts.

El texto ambiental, como los letreros y las etiquetas, consta tanto del texto como de una senal contextual disenada para atraer la atencion visual del lector. Sin embargo, las senales contextuales pueden distraer la atencion de los ninos del texto en si, poniendo en tela de juicio el valor del texto ambiental en el desarrollo temprano de la habilidad de leer. Se uso la tecnologia de seguir los movimientos oculares para medir cuanto tiempo los ninos se fijaban en las letras en textos ambientales. La relacion entre el tiempo que pasaron fijandose en las letras y el conocimiento de letras y palabras, al igual que las diferencias a traves de diferentes tipos de textos ambientales, tambien fueron examinadas. Ninos pre escolares (N = 39) de entre 3 y 5 anos vieron fotos de nueve textos ambientales y sus equivalentes textuales estandar mientras se grababa su fijacion. Se encontro que los ninos le ponian atencion a las palabras en textos ambientales, aunque mostraron fijarse mas y por mas tiempo a los textos impresos sin senales contextuales. La fijacion de los ninos no tiene relacion a su conocimiento de letras. Sin embargo, la fijacion en las palabras en textos ambientales variaba de acuerdo al tipo de item y sugiere que el aprendizaje de letras podria ser facilitado usando textos ambientales con letras mas grandes y centralizadas.

Children are shaped in part by their environment and one rich in communication is therefore beneficial. Activities such as play and reading have long lasting positive effects on development. This study examined the social and demographic characteristics of mothers who play with, read to and tell stories to their child, using data from the UK-wide Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).

Methods
The study included 14 034 mothers of singleton 5-year-old children. Using data from the first and third sweeps of the MCS, we examined how often mothers engaged with their child in playing, reading and telling stories, according to their social and demographic characteristics: ethnicity, socio-economic status, highest academic qualification, lone mother status, age at birth of cohort child, number of children and employment status. Adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted using Stata.

Results
When their children were 5 years old, 22% of mothers reported playing, 51% reading and 13% telling stories everyday. Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Black mothers were significantly less likely to play with their child at least weekly compared with White mothers. The same applied to lone mothers compared with those living with a partner. Mothers with academic qualifications lower than degree level were less likely to read at least once weekly. Compared with mothers who worked full-time, those who worked part-time, were ‘on-leave’ or unemployed, were more likely to play with, and read to, their child at least weekly. Mothers with more than one child were significantly less likely to engage at least weekly in any of the three activities studied.

Conclusions
We found significant inequalities in the frequency of playing, reading and telling stories according to sociodemographic characteristics. This information is important to be able to target more effectively vulnerable children using established public health initiatives, like ‘Bookstart’ and ‘Surestart’, aimed at promoting play, reading and story telling."

NA The first study described the HLE of 4-year-old FR children. NA Two distinct factors were identified: storybook exposure and direct instruction of orthographic forms. NA The amount of interactional literacy-related input that FR and TD children received at home was broadly equivalent. NA 
Second, the relationship of the early HLE to language and emergent literacy skills both concurrently and longitudinally (at age 5) was investigated. NA Storybook exposure predicted a wider range of child outcomes than previous research has suggested. NA Notably, a relationship between storybook exposure and phoneme awareness emerged later for FR than TD children. NA Direct instruction predicted children’s decoding skills in the first year of school. NA NA A pair of path models predicting decoding and reading comprehension skills at age 6 revealed multiple indirect pathways from early HLE to reading outcomes two years later. NA The magnitude of several longitudinal relationships was larger for FR than TD children. NA A direct pathway from early storybook exposure to reading comprehension was identified in the FR group only. NA Effects of family SES on reading outcomes were fully mediated by the HLE variables and oral language.
In an observation study, the linguistic and socio-emotional quality of shared storybook interactions was found to be equivalent between FR and TD mother-child dyads. NA Children’s orientation to print at age 4 predicted word reading ability a year later, and interactional affective quality predicted children’s oral language skills. NA These findings are discussed, with a focus on the potential for rich early literacy-related experiences in the home to act as a protective factor in the literacy development of children at elevated risk of reading difficulty."

The focus of the study was on the ways parents responded to children's miscues. Data collected drew on two cohorts of children and their parents who entered the longitudinal study when children were in kindergarten. Of the 70 participating parents, 65 were mothers. The findings converged on three main points. First, parents explicitly attempted to develop reading skills in their children while primarily reading books to their kindergartners by teaching and practicing letter names and sounds and cueing children to take on small pieces of the reading role. In Grade 1, parents focused their children's attention on various clues and modeled various strategies in response to miscues the child made in reading to the parent. Second, parents insisted on accurate reading, ignoring only 2 to 4 percent of miscues in comparison to findings that teachers ignore 40 to 60 percent of miscues. Third, parents' goals and values predict the kinds of coaching they use during shared book reading. Parents whose primary goal was enjoyment added to the reading interaction with comments to enhance interest in and comprehension of the story. Parent behavior during shared book reading in kindergarten predicted 8 to 9 percent of the variance on first-graders' word recognition and passage comprehension, respectively.

Past researchers have used conservative measures of the HLE that measure only one indicator (e.g. Storybook Title Identification), while others have included broad conceptualizations including demographic variables, parent-child text interactions, playing word games, and visiting the local library (Schmit et al., 2011; Levy, Gong, Hessels, Evans, & Jared, 2006; Lyytinen, Laasko, Poikkeus, 1998; Senechal, LeFevre, Thomas & Daly, 1992). The present study utilized a broad measure of the HLE to understand its relationship with emergent literacy skills for a sample of low-income kindergarten students. A total of 76 parent participants completed a questionnaire regarding their child’s home literacy experiences. Additionally, these children enrolled in kindergarten were assessed on measures of phonological awareness and early literacy skills. Results from the regression analyses suggest that literacy activities conducted in the home environment alone do not significantly explain the variance of phonological awareness or early literacy scores. However, after taking into account demographic variables, the HLE significantly explained an additional 5.3% of the variance in early literacy scores and 3.9% of the variance in phonological awareness scores. These findings indicate that demographic variables explain a large percentage of children’s phonological awareness and early literacy scores, and may differentially impact emergent literacy skills. Implications for educators and school decisionmakers are discussed, and suggestions for future research are considered."

Parents talked about some letters, including those that are common in English words and the first letter of their children’s names, especially often. Parents’ focus on the child’s initial was especially strong in families of higher socioeconomic status, and the extent to which parents talked about the child’s initial during the later sessions of the study was related to the children’s kindergarten reading skill. Conversations that included the child’s initial were longer than those that did not, and parents presented a variety of information about this letter. Learning to read is crucial for success in school and life. Consequently, researchers, educators, and policy makers are interested in finding out why some children learn to read more easily than others. Part of the answer may lie in the literacy-related activities that children participate in at home, before formal reading instruction begins. These activities may include being read to by their parents, learning to spell their names, and playing with magnets in the shapes of letters. Children who are reported by their parents to engage in such activities infrequently are on average less successful in learning to read than children who are reported to engage in them often (e.g., Burgess, Hecht, & Lonigan, 2002; Christian, Morrison, & Bryant, 1998). Shared book reading is the most studied aspect of the home literacy environment, but researchers have suggested that the construct of home literacy be expanded to include other activities (e.g., Phillips & Lonigan, 2009). Here, we focus on one potentially important but understudied activity—parents’ talk about letters of the alphabet with their young children—and how this varies across families and relates to children’s later reading performance."

This study focused on home literacy promotion and parent involvement in school, two parenting practices often associated with childrenâ€™s academic achievement. The sample consisted of 103 Black parents with a wide range of educational attainment and preschool-aged children enrolled in urban child care centers.

To address the research goals, a nationally representative sample of Head Start children, the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (2003 cohort), was used for analysis. The children were aged 3–4 years at programme entry. The mothers' average age at programme entry was 39 years old. A parallel process model was utilized to examine the growth factors of joint book reading and receptive vocabulary in parallel. Three significant findings emerged: (1) initial levels of English receptive vocabulary and joint book reading positively covaried; (2) English receptive vocabulary and joint book reading were positively and reciprocally related to each other; and (3) slopes for joint book reading and English receptive vocabulary negatively covaried. Results suggest that joint book reading can support and scaffold Head Start children's English receptive vocabulary. Reciprocally, Head Start children's English receptive vocabulary appears to predict the extent to which they engage in joint book reading at home. Moreover, the frequency of joint book reading decreases as the children demonstrate higher levels of English receptive vocabulary. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

To explore the link between pre-school children's general home computer use and their letter knowledge.



Methods

As part of the Early Language in Victoria Study, a community cohort of 1539 four-year-old children was tested on letter knowledge as well as on non-verbal intelligence, oral language, articulation and phonological awareness. Performance on these measures was examined in relation to parent-questionnaire responses exploring home literacy environment and the amount of time children spent using the computer.



Results

A positive correlation between computer use and letter knowledge was found, and this association was still evident after controlling for other cognitive and environmental factors known to predict the development of letter knowledge in young children.



Conclusions

Greater computer use in pre-school children appears to have a positive association with emerging literacy development. Future research needs to examine the nature of that association."

In 1993, the National Adult Literacy Study reported that 90 million adult Americans scored in the lowest 2 levels of a 5-level scale intended to assess the degree of proficiency to function in society and achieve one's goals.1 Those who score at the lowest 2 levels have difficulty integrating information from complex texts or documents and performing calculations requiring two or more sequential operations.1 In the 1990s, evidence began to emerge about the prevalence of low literacy in health care settings and its adverse influence on health outcomes.2,3 In February 1999, the American Medical Association (AMA) Council on Scientific Affairs recommended the allocation of federal and private funds for research in this area.4

Researchers and policy makers often use the phrase “health literacy” to describe a set of skills needed to function in the health care environment. To date, however, research in this area has focused on the relationship between reading ability and a variety of health outcomes. In most cases, reading ability was measured with one of three instruments (Table 1). No studies have measured the value of health literacy as a broader construct.5

Low income makes a minor contribution. Socio-economic status exerts its influence on early literacy primarily through its association with other factors. Children from disadvantaged families are less likely to have experiences that encourage the development of fundamental skills for reading acquisition, specifically phonological awareness, vocabulary and oral language. These skills underlie the cognitive processes in the “simple view” of reading – word identification and language comprehension. Low quality early home literacy environments suppress children’s genetic potential, increasing the risk a child will struggle to learn to read. In addition, children from low socio-economic status backgrounds are more likely to have infant health outcomes associated with cognitive impairments, such as preterm birth and low birth weight, and are less likely to attend preschool.

Parents of 183 children starting kindergarten in the fall (median child age = 58 months) completed an early home learning experiences questionnaire. Most of the children whose parents completed the questionnaire were recruited for numeracy and literacy testing 1 year later (along with 32 children from the inner city). Confirmatory factor analyses were used to reduce survey items, and hierarchical regression analyses were used to predict the relation among parents’ attitudes, academic expectations for their children, reports of formal and informal numeracy, and literacy home practices on children’s test scores. Parental reports of formal home numeracy practices (e.g., practicing simple sums) predicted children’s symbolic number system knowledge, whereas reports of informal exposure to games with numerical content (measured indirectly through parents’ knowledge of children’s games) predicted children’s non-symbolic arithmetic, as did numeracy attitudes (e.g., parents’ enjoyment of numeracy). The home literacy results replicated past findings; parental reports of formal literacy practices (e.g., helping their children to read words) predicted children’s word reading, whereas reports of informal experiences (i.e., frequency of shared reading measured indirectly through parents’ storybook knowledge) predicted children’s vocabulary. These findings support a multifaceted model of children’s early numeracy environment, with different types of early home experiences (formal and informal) predicting different numeracy outcomes."

1,1988829787,home grown for reading parental contributions to young children s emergent literacy and word recognition,2008,"mary ann evans, deborah shaw",canadian psychology,1,64,79,"This article provides an integrative review of key aspects of emergent literacy and specific home activities that empirical research has shown to support their development. Given the importance of word recognition in reading development, home contributions to word recognition as well as to four areas of emergent literacy that contribute to word recognition are highlighted. These include phonological awareness, letter knowledge, print concepts, and vocabulary. Particular attention is devoted to the activity of shared book reading to outline its different facets, changing nature, and potential impact on emergent literacy and word recognition skill. About a half a century ago—a phrase that conveys just how much our conception has changed— children were given ""reading readiness tests"" at school entrance to assess whether they were ""ready"" for the new initiative of learning to read. About 20 years ago, in concert with views of child development as a constructivist process, this conception began to change toward an understanding of learning to read as a process that starts much earlier in life and that is based upon a variety of foundational skills acquired before children enter formal schooling. The term emergent literacy, launched by Teale and Sulzby (1986) in their edited volume, and brought to life in Clay's (1993) observational studies of young children, was introduced to refer to this conception. More recently, it has come to refer to the skills and reading-like behaviours that are developmental precursors to their conventional and more ad- vanced counterparts. The view that the home environment in which children grow plays a substantial role in their literacy development is nicely illustrated by a large-scale study of twins completed by Petrill, Deater-Deckard, Schatschneider, and Davis (2005). Here, family environment characteristics were associated with children's read- ing outcome beyond what could be explained by genes shared by parents and children. The purpose of this review article is to detail key activities of the home environment provided by parents to young children that are predictive of reading development in general and, more specifically, of aspects of emergent literacy skills contributing to word recognition skill—phonological ability, alphabetic knowledge, concepts of print, and vocabulary. Given the salience of shared book reading as a home activity, a separate section is devoted to its different facets, changing nature, and potential effects. To provide a background for why these specific topics have been selected, a brief outline follows directly below of what is meant by emergent literacy and of the transition from emergent literacy to conventional word recognition."

Ninety Hong Kong Chinese ESL kindergarteners were assessed for English vocabulary, phonological awareness, letter knowledge and word reading. Their parents completed a questionnaire about home literacy practices. Results showed that these practices can be classified into three aspects: shared reading, exposure to English materials and home teaching. Shared reading uniquely predicted receptive and expressive vocabulary, syllable awareness and word reading in English. Exposure to English materials predicted expressive vocabulary and home teaching predicted letter knowledge."

The authors examined the impact of book access on print exposure via a monthly book distribution program. At 10 months of implementation, 170 families enrolled in the Imagination Library Program in Syracuse, New York responded to a survey. Results indicated that length of enrollment was associated with frequency of child-directed reading and story discussion, even when controlling for child age, gender, income, parental education, race, parental nation of birth, and primary language spoken at home. Consequently, the authors conceptualize such programs as catalysts for developing early literacy skills by increasing child-directed reading."
1,2000108179,developmental changes in parents use of miscue feedback during shared book reading,2005,"jubilea mansell, mary ann evans, laura hamiltonhulak",reading research quarterly,1,22,60,"This longitudinal study across the primary grades examined whether there were patterns in feedback strategies parents provided to children's miscues during shared book reading, and whether parents changed their use of those strategies over time as their children's reading skills increased. Parents of normally developing beginning readers were audiotaped in their homes reading books with their children in kindergarten, first grade, and second grade. Parent responses to miscues were coded as either ignoring the miscue, encouragement to try the word again, graphophonemic clues, context clues, or supplying the word. Clues parents gave prior to a child's attempting to read a word were also coded. For each feedback category there were statistically significant differences over time. As grade level increased, parents decreased their use of context clues, supplying the misread word, and clues given prior to a child's attempt at a word. In contrast, they increased their use of encouragement to try the word again and ignoring the miscue. Giving graphophonemic clues peaked in first grade. In addition, cluster analysis and correlations indicated stability in parent strategies across the grades. Findings suggest that parents have styles of supporting emerging reading skills that are adapted as children's skills increase.



Este estudio longitudinal llevado a cabo en los primeros grados investigo la posible existencia de patrones en las estrategias de apoyo que los padres ponen en juego cuando los ninos cometen errores durante la lectura compartida de libros. Asimismo se estudio si los padres modificaban el uso de esas estrategias en el tiempo, a medida que la capacidad de lectura de los ninos aumentaba. Se hicieron grabaciones de audio a un grupo de padres de lectores iniciales de desarrollo normal (jardin, primero y segundo grado); las mismas se llevaron a cabo en los hogares durante la lectura compartida de libros. Se codificaron las respuestas de los padres a los errores de lectura de la siguiente manera: ignorar el error, alentar a repetir la palabra, dar pistas grafofonemicas o contextuales y proporcionar la palabra correcta. Tambien se codificaron las pistas dadas por los padres antes del intento del nino por pronunciar una palabra. Se hallaron diferencias significativas a lo largo del tiempo para cada categoria de apoyo. Cuanto mas alto el grado de escolaridad, disminuian las estrategias de uso de pistas contextuales, proporcionar la palabra correcta y dar pistas antes del intento de leer del nino. Por el contrario, aumentaron el uso de la incentivacion para que el nino tratara de volver a leer y la estrategia de ignorar el error. La estrategia de dar pistas grafofonemicas alcanzo el pico en primer grado. Adicionalmente el analisis de los clusters y las correlaciones evidenciaron estabilidad en las estrategias de los padres a traves del tiempo. Los hallazgos sugieren que los estilos de los padres para dar apoyo a las habilidades de lectura inicial se adaptan a medida que aumenta la capacidad de los ninos.



Diese Quer durch die Primarstufen ausgefuhrte Langzeitstudie untersuchte, ob es Muster in den Feedbackstrategien gab, die Eltern aufgrund von Fehlhinweisen der Kinder beim gemeinsamen Buchlesen vermittelten, und ob Eltern die Anwendung solcher Strategien im Laufe der Zeit veranderten, sobald sich die Leseleistungen ihrer Kinder steigerten. Eltern von sich normal entwickelnden Leseanfangern wurden wahrend des Lesens von Buchern zu Hause, mit ihren Kindern im Kindergarten, in der ersten Klasse und in der zweiten Klasse mittels Tonband aufgenommen. Elternreaktionen auf Fehlhinweise wurden entweder als Ignorierung der Fehlhinweise, Ermunterung das Wort nochmals zu versuchen, graphophonemische Hinweise, Kontexthinweise, oder als das Uberliefern des Wortes kodiert. Hinweise, die Eltern einem Kind vor dessen Versuch das Wort zu lesen gaben, wurden ebenfalls kodiert. Fur jede Feedbackkategorie ergaben sich im Laufe der Zeit statistisch bedeutende Unterschiede. Mit der Steigerung der Unterrichtsstufe verringerten die Eltern ihre Anwendung von Kontexthinweisen, Lieferung des falsch gelesenen Wortes und die im voraus gegebenen Hinweise, bevor das Kind das Wort aufgriff. Im Gegenteil, steigerten sie die Anwendung von Ermunterungen zum erneuten Versuch des Wortes unter Nichtbeachtung des Fehlhinweises. Das Vermitteln von graphophonemischen Hinweisen erreichte die Spitze in der ersten Klasse. Zusatzlich zeigten Blockanalyse und Korrelationen Stabilitat in den Elternstrategien quer durch alle Stufen. Die Erkenntnisse lassen vermuten, das Eltern ihre Anwendungsmethoden zur Unterstutzung aufstrebender Lesefahigkeiten haben, die angepasst werden, sobald sich die Leistungen der Kinder steigern.



Cette etude longitudinale au long de la scolarite primaire cherche a savoir s'il y a des structures dans les strategies que les parents utilisent lorsque les enfants font des erreurs en situation de lecture partagee de livres, et si les parents changent de strategie dans le temps lorsque les competences lecturales des enfants se developpent. On a procede a des enregistrements audio de parents d'enfants apprenant a lire sans probleme alors qu'ils lisaient des livres a la maison avec leurs enfants, et ce au jardin d'enfants, en premiere et en seconde annee. On a code les reponses des parents aux erreurs en: absence de reaction, incitation a relire, indices grapho-phonemiques, indices semantiques, lecture du mot par l'adulte. On a egalement code les indices que les parents donnaient avant que les enfants essaient de lire un mot. Il apparait des differences significatives dans le temps pour chaque type de feedback. Au fur et a mesure que le niveau de l'enfant s'ameliore, les parents emploient de moins en moins d'indices graphophonemiques, de lecture du mot par l'adulte, et d'indices fournis avant que l'enfant essaie de lire un mot. Par contre, ce qui augmente est les incitations a relire le mot et le fait de ne pas reagir a l'erreur. Le fait de donner des indices grapho-phonemiques culmine en premiere annee. L'analyse par clusters et par correlations indique que les strategies des parents sont stables d'une classe a l'autre. Les resultats laissent penser que les types d'aides fournies par les parents aux enfants apprennant a lire s'adaptent aux progres que ceux-ci effectuent."

One hundred two children were randomly assigned to the KITS intervention and 90 were randomly assigned to the foster care services as usual comparison group. At the end of the kindergarten year, teachers were asked to report on the children's oppositional and aggressive behaviors in the classroom. Controlling for gender, baseline levels of parent-reported oppositional and aggressive behaviors, and level of disruptiveness in the classroom, children who had received the intervention had significantly lower levels of oppositional and aggressive behaviors in the classroom. Findings suggest that an intervention designed to increase school readiness in children in foster care can have positive effects on kindergarten classroom behavior."

Eighty-two Greek children from mainly middle socioeconomic backgrounds were followed from kindergarten to grade 1 and were assessed on measures of nonverbal intelligence, emergent literacy skills, early math concepts, verbal counting, reading, and math fluency. The parents of the children also responded to a questionnaire regarding the frequency of home literacy and numeracy activities. The results of path analyses indicated that parents’ teaching of literacy skills predicted reading fluency through the effects of letter knowledge and phonological awareness. Storybook exposure predicted reading fluency through the effects of vocabulary on phonological awareness. Finally, parents’ teaching of numeracy skills predicted math fluency through the effects of verbal counting. These findings suggest that both the home literacy and the home numeracy environments are important for early reading and math acquisition, but their effects are mediated by emergent literacy and numeracy skills."

Results revealed that parents are aware of their roles in literacy development and are implementing activities at home that would enhance their children’s interests in reading. Likewise, teachers provide a myriad of activities that cater to the students’ reading needs. There were relationships between the reading materials found at home and the reading ability of the day care students."

However, local contextual factors should be taken into consideration in any transfer of research findings. This study examines associations that socioeconomic status (SES) and the home literacy environment (HLE) have with reading achievement in the developing world. Models that predict reading achievement are created and the patterns across countries are analyzed. The correlation coefficients for achievement and SES, as well as achievement and HLE are compared. Significant between-country variation in the best proxies for SES and HLE is discovered. Results from this study suggest that education efforts in the developing world must consider local contexts to achieve their goals."

Fathers' academic pressure was predictive of lower achievement, whereas mothers' encouragement and support predicted higher achievement. Both parents used more academic pressure with their sons, whereas using more encouragement and support with their daughters. The effects of parental involvement were mediated through children's academic competence. This study demonstrates the interactive influences of parents' educational involvement and children's personal characteristics in predicting school achievement.

The contribution of these activities in kindergarten to children’s reading and writing at the end of first grade were evaluated, controlling for family SES and children’s early skills (vocabulary and letter naming). Eighty-eight Arabic-speaking children and their mothers participated in the study. Results revealed that family SES, children’s early skills and home literacy activities in kindergarten correlated with children’s achievements at the end of first grade. Joint writing contributed significantly to children’s literacy in first grade and the contribution of shared reading was almost significant. Joint writing was found to contribute to children’s literacy achievements in first grade beyond book reading. The study extends our knowledge on literacy acquisition in Arabic, highlighting the significance of early parent–child literacy activities as a predictor of Arabic-speaking children’s literacy achievements in school."

A total of 1,529 children (5-to-6-year-olds) were tested on word reading twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of a kindergarten year. The mothers of the children (n = 1,529) answered a questionnaire on reading-related activities with their children at home (on shared reading, teaching letters, and the teaching of reading) and on their level of education, their child’s birth order, and the gender of the child. The results show that of the three reading-related activities, mothers’ teaching of reading is the best predictor of the development of reading skills among kindergarten children. The results also show that good reading skills at the beginning of the kindergarten year increase the maternal teaching of reading a child subsequently receives. The results further demonstrate that girls, firstborns, and children with more highly educated mothers are more likely to become good readers by the end of the kindergarten year."

Children were tested on measures of letter–word knowledge, sound awareness, receptive vocabulary, oral expression, and mathematical skill. Parent reading-related knowledge showed significant positive links with child letter–word knowledge and sound awareness, but showed no correlations with child measures of mathematical skill or vocabulary. Furthermore, parent reading-related knowledge was not associated with parents’ own print exposure or cultural knowledge, indicating that knowledge about English word structure may be separate from other cognitive skills.

A total of 94 5–6-year-old children, 47 from low SES (LSES) and 47 from high (HSES) families, and their mothers participated. Mother–child interactions while reading an unfamiliar book were videotaped and their verbal expressions were coded for extracting maternal mediation level. Children’s independent EL level was assessed prior to the interaction. Compared with the LSES group, HSES children showed higher EL levels and their homes had a richer literacy environment. Maternal mediation level differed by SES: LSES mothers paraphrased text more often; HSES mothers’ higher mediation level included a discussion of the written system and making connections beyond the text. In the HSES group, maternal mediation level and HLE related to children’s EL; no such relationships appeared in the LSES group.

Although quite a few studies report immigrant parents' belief and perspectives of their children's second language reading and writing, it remains unknown for school teachers and second literacy specialists the steps that immigrant parents take to improve their children's second language learning after the children leave school. This longitudinal case study intends to fill the gap by profiling an ESL child's early second language writing development, from day one of the child's American schooling to the time when the child received above grade level instruction. The detailed data in naturalistic settings are valuable evidence of effective parental intervention in second language acquisition. Due to the parents' linguistic and educational background, their home literacy practices at the early stage of a child's second writing development are invaluable for classroom teachers. Some of their strategies are also applicable for immigrant parents who don't know where or how to start helping their children learn their second language well."

Studies in typically developing children suggest that family environment might be one contributor to this unexplained variance. However, the effect of family environment in relation to cognition in atypical children with FXS has been relatively unexplored to date.



Methods The present authors examined the putative genetic and environmental factors associated with cognition in a group of age-matched children consisting of 26 females with FXS and 31 typically developing children. All subjects were administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – Revised; and the subjects’ parents were administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – Revised, and completed the Hollingshead Index of Social Status and the Moos & Moos Family Environment Scale.



Results Using a multiple regression analytic strategy, the present authors found that family environment contributed significantly to cognitive abilities in typically developing girls, but did not have a unique contribution to cognitive abilities in girls with FXS. There was a suggestion that, for girls with FXS, socio-economic status, a measure of sociocultural environment, was correlated with IQ.



Conclusions The present study provides a basis for future research on the environmental contributions to cognitive abilities, particularly work related to verbal cognition."

The checklists consisted of Titles, Magazines, and Authors (targets and foils). The children's responses decreased from Titles to Magazines to Authors. With children in first grade and their parents (Expt 1), we established that PE shows links to socio-economic status. In a longitudinal study conducted in Grade 1 (Expt 2), a hierarchical regression indicated that PE predicts variance in word reading after age, phonological skills, and letter knowledge have been partialled out. In older children (Expt 3), and only in Grades 4–5, PE accounts for unique variance in word recognition, in word spelling, and, finally, in vocabulary, after chronological and lexical age have been controlled for."

One hundred twenty children aged 58–69 months were assessed on letter-sound and letter-name knowledge, as well as on phonological awareness skills at the beginning, the middle and the end of kindergarten. The findings indicated that: (a) kindergarten children knew more letter-sounds than letter-names in almost every case across the assessment points; (b) letter-sound knowledge predicted letter-name knowledge slightly better than vice versa; (c) phonological awareness was associated directly with later letter-sound and letter-name knowledge, and (d) the bidirectional hypothesis between phonological awareness and letters knowledge was not confirmed."
1,2026578385,the end of the reading age grade and age effects in early schooling,2004,"james r m alexander, f martin",journal of school psychology,1,11,10,"Abstract NA NA During the school years, psychological test norms may be indexed by age or by grade. A number of studies have shown that using age-based norms appears to produce biases associated with grade assignment. Cahan and Cohen [Child Dev. 60 (1989) 1239–1249] showed that the effect of one grade was over twice the effect of 1 year of age for most verbal cognitive ability subtests in Grades 4–6. A higher ratio might be expected for more curriculum-related areas such as reading tests. Analysis of a representative sample of 4257 Grade 1 and 2 children in Tasmanian government schools (which use relatively strict age assignment to grades) for three subtests of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test—Revised (WRMTR): Word Identification, Word Attack, and Passage Comprehension, showed that the grade effect is about twice the age effect. This data shows that using age-based norms instead of grade-based norms for reading and other verbal ability tests may produce bias in the early school years. Psychologists should thus be primarily concerned with children's educational history, as once children have entered school other developmental factors indexed by age have less influence on children's verbal performance."

The modal view of emergent literacy is that it encompasses all aspects of children's oral and written language skills. The present article proposes an alternative view whereby emergent literacy is a separate construct from oral language and metalinguistic skills. It is also proposed that emergent literacy is composed of two distinct components; children's conceptual knowledge (e.g., knowledge of the functions of print) and children's early procedural knowledge of writing and reading (e.g., invented spelling). Evidence is presented that supports this differentiated view of language and emergent literacy by showing that distinct patterns of relations exist among emergent literacy, oral language, and metalinguistic skills. It is concluded that separating the constructs of language and emergent literacy is an interesting alternative to current conceptions of emergent literacy. In time, such theoretical fine tuning will serve as better guides for policy and practice."

The current study tries to address this scarcity by examining the effects of daily parent–child reading activities on the German vocabulary knowledge of children with (n = 531) and without migration background (n = 499) between the ages of three to five. Using propensity score matching (PSM), determinants of reading aloud daily to children are analyzed in the first step. Native parents are found to be more likely to read aloud daily to their children. Parents’ education, cultural capital and a high frequency of engaging parenting practices also predict the frequency of parent–child reading. Factors specific to immigrant families are the age of migration and the primary family language. The effect of reading aloud on the vocabulary skills of children is the focus of the second part of the analysis. Positive effects are found among children of immigrants and children of native-born parents. However, this positive effect is reduced over time for native children. Overall, reading aloud daily is most effective among children of immigrant families, using the language of the host country as the primary family language, and among parents with good receiving country language skills."

Parent-child reading (Home Literacy Environment Questionnaire plus a children's Title Recognition Test) and parental teaching of letters, words, and name writing were assessed 6 months prior to children's school entry. The 143 children (55% male participants; mean age = 5.36 years, SD = 0.29) attended Gold Coast, Australia government preschools. Parent-child reading and literacy teaching were only weakly correlated (r = .18) and were related to different outcomes consistent with the original model. Age, gender, memory, and nonverbal ability were controlled. Parental teaching was independently related to R. W. Woodcock's (1997) preschool Letter-Word Identification scores (R²change = 4.58%, p = .008). This relationship then mediated the relationships between parental teaching and Grades 1 and 2 letter-word identification, single-word reading and spelling rates, and phonological awareness (rhyme detection and phonological deletion). Parent-child reading was independently related to Grade 1 vocabulary (R²change = 5.6%, p = .005).

Maternal verbal scaffolding indirectly influenced both decoding and comprehension, through its support of children's language abilities at 3 and 4 years of age. Additionally, there was a trend for a direct effect of 4 year child language on reading comprehension at 10 years. As maternal verbal scaffolding was assessed during every day routines, this suggests that rich language input in the broad social context of the home promotes language and, in turn, later reading skills. Given that maternal verbal scaffolding can be enhanced through interventions, these results have important educational implications."

The ways that parents responded to each of a child's oral reading errors or miscues were coded into levels of assistance that reflected increasing support at each successive level. In addition children's attempts at rereading miscued words were coded as successful or not. Parents often provided a string of feedback clues and analyses revealed that the level of support parents provided shifted up or increased when their child was unsuccessful in rereading a word after feedback. With increasing level of parental support children's success in rereading misread words increased. Moreover, children with weaker word recognition skill were offered feedback at higher levels of support by their parents.

The background characteristics studied included urbanicity, maternal education, ethnicity, and family size among 112 preschool children (59 rural and 53 urban, M age = 56.78 months). Findings showed that rural and urban preschoolers may have similar literacy abilities. However, when maternal education was controlled for, family background variables and components of the home literacy environment predicted emergent literacy skills differently for the two groups. Moreover, mother's active involvement and the child's own engagement in literacy seemed to play a salient role in early literacy development across groups."

The present study expands previous studies by examining how home literacy practices are related to growth trajectories of emergent literacy skills (i.e., vocabulary, letter-name knowledge, and phonological awareness) and conventional literacy skills (i.e., word reading, pseudoword reading, and spelling), and by using data from Korean children and families (N = 192). The study revealed two dimensions of home literacy practices, home reading and parent teaching. Frequent reading at home was positively associated with children’s emergent literacy skills as well as conventional literacy skills in Korean. However, children whose parents reported more frequent teaching tended to have low scores in their phonological awareness, vocabulary, word reading and pseudoword reading after accounting for home reading. These results suggest a bidirectional relationship between home literacy practices, parent teaching in particular, and children’s literacy skills such that parents adjust their teaching in response to their child’s literacy acquisition. Furthermore, cultural variation in views on parent teaching may explain these results."

The reader pointed to each word while reading to half of the children. After each book, children were asked to recognize elements of the illustrations and the specially formatted text elements from among a set of foils. Videotaped sessions were coded for the time children spent looking toward the pages with print versus illustrations. Analyses showed that the percentage of time looking at print was less than 2% in the no-pointing condition but increased with age. Pointing to the words increased print-looking time for all age groups and print target recognition for 4-year-olds. After controlling for receptive vocabulary, visual memory, and maturation associated with these scores, emergent orthography and letter-word identification predicted time looking at print and recognition of the print elements."

Two groups of mothers participated: mothers with a low education and mothers with a high education. The children’s emergent literacy was measured. The mothers evaluated their own children and 40 teachers evaluated these same children in the same domains. The children of mothers with a high education received higher scores in their actual emergent literacy level than the children of mothers with a low education. Their mothers’ and teachers’ evaluations were also higher than those in the counter group. The teachers’ and mothers’ evaluations of the children’s levels were higher than the children’s actual levels across both groups. No differences were found between the mothers’ and the teachers’ accuracy in evaluating the children’s level or between mothers from the two education groups.

Twenty-four untreated preschoolers served as a control group. The children were tested twice, at the beginning and at the end of the school year, in: phonological awareness, word writing, letter knowledge, orthographic awareness, listening comprehension, receptive vocabulary, and general knowledge. Both programs involved games and creative activities. The writing program encouraged letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and functional writing activities. The reading program utilized 11 children's books for focusing on language and exploring major concepts raised by these books. Results indicated that children in the two literacy programs progressed significantly more than the control group on phonological awareness and orthographic awareness. However, the joint writing group significantly outperformed both the joint reading group and the control group on phonological awareness, word writing, orthographic awareness, and letter knowledge.

To test the hypothesis that parent speech provides children with information about these differences, we studied parent–child conversations in CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000). We found that parents talk to their young children about letters, differentiating them from pictures, by 1–2 years of age and that some of these conversational patterns change across the preschool years in ways that emphasize important features of letters, such as their shape. We also found that children talk about letters and pictures in distinct ways, suggesting an implicit understanding of some of the differences between letters and pictures at an early age. Some differences in parent–child conversations about letters were found as a function of socioeconomic status: Lower SES families appeared to focus more on alphabetic order than higher SES families. The general letter knowledge expressed in these conversations suggests that everyday interactions are an important component of the home literacy environment and that they differ, in some respects, as a function of child age and family background."

Yet the nuances of how learning from book reading might vary across these contexts and with children's skills are not well understood. One hundred and thirty children participating in a longitudinal investigation of literacy development were videotaped reading a storybook with a parent. Children were also videotaped in their 33 preschool classrooms during the instructional book-reading portion of the day. Readings were coded for adult and child contextualized and decontextualized language relating to both decoding and meaning-making skills, and relations between this talk and emergent literacy outcomes were analyzed. Results demonstrate that parents and teachers overwhelmingly focus their book-related talk on meaning-related rather than code-related information, and that the relations between outcomes and talk depend in part on children's initial levels of vocabulary skills.

It may be that children's abilities in one language do not contribute to their reading abilities in their other language or that children's experiences with either language assist them in developing a common underlying proficiency that they draw upon when learning to read. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship among bilingual children's receptive language development and reading outcomes in first grade. Eighty-one bilingual children who were attending Head Start participated in the study. Growth curve models were used to examine the relationship between children's language abilities during two years in Head Start and reading outcomes at the end of first grade. Children's growth in both English and Spanish receptive vocabulary and oral comprehension predicted their English and Spanish reading abilities at the end of first grade within languages. Associations were also observed between languages with growth in English receptive language predicting Spanish reading comprehension and growth in Spanish receptive language predicting English reading comprehension.

Three hundred grade three children were assessed on letter, word, and sentence reading, and word writing abilities. Mothers/female guardians responded to a questionnaire-based interview about the home environment. The results show that performance in reading and writing measures was at a level slightly above 50% of the maximum score. Dispersion between the scores was large. There was no significant gender difference in performance, although the boys performed slightly higher than the girls. Correlation analysis showed moderate to high relationship between reading and writing measures and home environment variables. Multiple regression analysis procedure identified four predictors of a summary score of reading and writing ability. These are fathers’ education, the quality of house wall material, number of books for school subjects found in the home, and parental involvement in the child’s school learning. The home environment variables accounted for a rather large variance (31%) in reading and writing ability. Fathers’ education accounted for 16% of the variance and the other variables added 15% of the variance. A specific analysis revealed significant effect of father’s education, construction material for the house walls and books, but not of parental involvement, on separate reading measures (letter, word and sentence reading). Conversely, in terms of children’s ability to write, parental involvement was the only significant predictor. Possible explanations are discussed. The identified variables confirmed the significant role the home environment plays in children’s ability to read and write. The variables are important to consider for research as well as for government and policy decisions when planning to improve the home environment as well as children’s school learning and the development of literacy skills at least in contexts which have similarities with this study."

Preschool children (N = 50) from Bangalore, India, were assessed for vocabulary, phonological awareness, and print skills in English, their language of schooling. Parents reported on the home literacy environment via questionnaires and a children's book title checklist, adapted for an Indian sample. Parents' book-reading practices moderated the role of English in the home in predicting children's English receptive vocabulary, such that high levels of book reading compensated for low ambient levels of English in the home. English in the home also predicted children's phonological awareness, whereas parental book reading and teaching of print both predicted children's print skills. Implications for the role of book reading in families learning English as a second language are discussed."

The participants of this study were 60 mothers and their 4-year-old children. After controlling for mothers' educational attainment, mothers' literacy beliefs were positively related to the quality of home literacy environments and the instructional and affective quality of joint book-reading interactions. The quality of children's home literacy environments and mother–child joint book-reading interactions was related to children's development of early literacy skills. Findings are discussed in relation to the importance of understanding the connection between parents' literacy beliefs and behaviors in designing effective literacy interventions and creating school and family literacy connections."

Cluster analysis of the Q‐sort responses revealed four instructional approaches that differed in their focus on literacy skills, social development and self‐esteem. In addition, measures of emergent literacy skills, classroom behaviour and peer relationships were obtained for 162 low‐income children attending these kindergarten classrooms. Children in classrooms emphasising emergent literacy skills demonstrated greater mastery of such skills than did children in classrooms emphasising social development. Moreover, literacy skill‐focused teachers also reported fewer disruptive behaviour and peer problems among these children. These findings highlight the importance of integrating an emphasis on emergent literacy development into kindergarten curricula for promoting literacy development among low‐income children, and also suggest that children’s rates of problem behaviour may vary under different c..."

Longitudinal data were obtained for 1436 Finnish children (5- to 6-year-olds at baseline) and their mothers and fathers. 684 girls and 752 boys participating in the study represented four Finnish municipalities. The reading skills of the children were measured four times: at the beginning and at the end of their kindergarten year, and at the beginning and at the end of Grade 1. In kindergarten, decoding tests were administered individually. In Grade 1, group tests in reading fluency were performed. The children's mothers and fathers filled in questionnaires on the frequency of their teaching of reading and the frequency of shared reading with their children in the kindergarten year and in Grade 1. The results showed that the better word reading skills children showed in kindergarten, the more shared reading parents reported. Also, the better word reading skills boys evidenced in kindergarten, the more teaching of reading parents reported. However, in Grade 1, it was children's poor skills in reading that activated more frequent parents’ teaching of reading and more frequent shared reading."

In a sample of 58 mother–child pairs, the quality of the relationship between mothers and their children at 36 months old predicted the amount and quality of literacy information shared during a joint book-reading task in 1st grade. Other variables related to reading behavior were also examined but were found to be less predictive than maternal sensitive responding.

In total, 135 preschool children (72 girls) and their parents (primarily mothers) in an ethnically diverse, middle-income community were observed while writing a semi-structured invitation for a pretend birthday party together. Children's phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, word decoding, vocabulary, and fine motor skills were also assessed. Results revealed that parents provided variable, but generally low-level, support for children's approximation of sound-symbol correspondence in their writing (i.e., graphophonemic support), as well as for their production of letter forms (i.e., print support). Parents frequently accepted errors rather than asking for corrections (i.e., demand for precision). Further analysis of the parent–child dyads ( n  = 103) who wrote the child's name on the invitation showed that parents provided higher graphophonemic, but not print, support when writing the child's name than other words. Overall parental graphophonemic support was positively linked to children's decoding and fine motor skills, whereas print support and demand for precision were not related to any of the child outcomes. In sum, this study indicates that while parental support for preschoolers’ writing may be minimal, it is uniquely linked to key literacy-related outcomes in preschool."

This paper draws on a study of SOBATAKA implementation for the preschool children who were having dyslexia and very weak performance in mathematics - in recognizing, counting and writing number from 1 to 10. The reasons why SOBATAKA was designed and the process of how SOBATAKA was tested and implemented are explained detail in this paper. To analyze SOBATAKA's effectiveness, a thorough study of problem identification through class observation and parents-teacher interview has been executed. Then, process is followed by performing three types of assessment during the mathematics class; Activity 1- Pulling Forward the Bus while Saying the Ascending Number, Activity 2 - Singing an Ascending Number Song and Activity 3 - Writing Numbers from 1 to 10. From the result analysis, it was found that SOBATAKA was successfully tested and proven can benefit the slow learners at preschool level enhancing their skills of recognizing, counting and writing numbers from 1 to 10 in two weeks' time. The negative behaviors of fear, passive, not motivated, shy and less interest in learning mathematics have been positively changed to be much more daring, courage, active, confident and ambitious after the SOBATAKA's class treatments. Finally, it can be concluded that SOBATAKA is able to enhance the ability of the `slow learners at pre-school level' in learning numbers more effectively, but is also can strengthening their cognitive concept and social skills."

We explored the effect of computer animation of the print in order to draw the child’s attention to each word as it was read. We also investigated the influence of illustrating that not all visual displays are readable print on the child’s print knowledge. The measures of interest were print concept knowledge and early reading skill. Results indicated that simply drawing children’s attention to the print during shared reading was insufficient to facilitate children’s learning of print conventions, but this attention to print while hearing stories read did improve children’s letter reading. The child’s active engagement with the print during shared story reading led to further improvements in written language skills, as illustrated by gains in knowledge about print concepts."

Using the ECLS-B dataset, this study investigated shared reading among nearly 700 families of diverse ethnic, linguistic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Coding of families’ book-related discussion focused on the variety of types of talk that parents used during reading. Results showed that parents focused primarily on the meaning of the story, with little attention to the code of the text. The range of talk techniques that parents used was largely independent of background factors such as child gender, ethnicity, or age, as well as family home language. A wider variety of meaning-related remarks by parents was linked to more advanced language skills among preschoolers. Findings provide a portrait of the nature of shared book reading discussion among American families, a profile of the background factors that are linked to this talk, and a precise account of the unique contributions of this talk to key emergent language and literacy competencies."

Recently, the teacher-completed Early Development Instrument (EDI), a new measure of children's school readiness in 5 developmental areas, was developed, tested, and implemented in Canada. EDI results confirmed the existence of a school entry gap. In this article, we explore factors in 5 areas of risk: socioeconomic status, family structure, child health, parent health, and parent involvement in literacy development. In a series of logistic regressions, we demonstrate that variables in all 5 areas, as well as age and gender, contribute to the gap. Child's suboptimal health, male gender, and coming from a family with low income contribute most strongly to the vulnerability at school entry.

In a longitudinal study of a diverse sample of 44 preschool children, we examined the extent to which their understanding of the cardinal meanings of the number words (e.g., knowing that the word “four” refers to sets with 4 items) is predicted by the “number talk” they hear from their primary caregiver in the early home environment. Results from 5 visits showed substantial variation in parents’ number talk to children between the ages of 14 and 30 months. Moreover, this variation predicted children’s knowledge of the cardinal meanings of number words at 46 months, even when socioeconomic status and other measures of parent and child talk were controlled. These findings suggest that encouraging parents to talk about number with their toddlers, and providing them with effective ways to do so, may positively impact children’s school achievement."

The three studies in which parents read to their children did not result in significant reading gains. When deciding which type of intervention to implement, educators will have to weigh a variety of factors such as the differences in effectiveness across the different types of intervention, the amount of resources needed to implement the interventions, and the reading level of the children."

The goal of our study is to explore one route through which SES may influence children’s early literacy skills: informal conversations about letters. The study builds on previous studies (Robins, Treiman, & Rosales, 2014; Robins, Treiman, Rosales, & Otake, 2012; Robins & Treiman, 2009) that show how U. S. parents and their young children talk about writing and provides preliminary evidence about similarities and differences in parent–child conversations as a function of SES. Focusing on parents and children aged three to five, we conducted five separate analyses of these conversations, asking whether and how family SES influences the previously established patterns. Although we found talk about letters in both upper and lower SES families, there were differences in the nature of these conversations. The proportion of letter talk utterances that were questions was lower in lower SES families and, of all the letter names that lower SES families talked about, more of them were uttered in isolation rather than in sequences. Lower SES families were especially likely to associate letters with the child’s name, and they placed more emphasis on sequences in alphabetic order. We found no SES differences in the factors that influenced use of particular letter names (monograms), but there were SES differences in two-letter sequences (digrams). Focusing on the alphabet and on associations between the child’s name and the letters within it may help to interest the child in literacy activities, but they many not be very informative about the relationship between letters and words in general. Understanding the patterns in parent–child conversations about letters is an important first step for exploring their contribution to children’s early literacy skills and school readiness."

In previous research we found that this association shows neural specificity; specifically we found that groups of low and middle SES children differed disproportionately in perisylvian/language and prefrontal/executive abilities relative to other neurocognitive abilities. Here we address several new questions: To what extent does this disparity between groups reflect a gradient of SES-related individual differences in neurocognitive development, as opposed to a more categorical difference? What other neurocognitive systems differ across individuals as a function of SES? Does linguistic ability mediate SES differences in other systems? And how do specific prefrontal/executive subsystems vary with SES? One hundred and fifty healthy, socioeconomically diverse first-graders were administered tasks tapping language, visuospatial skills, memory, working memory, cognitive control, and reward processing.

Thirty-five Head Start preschool classrooms were assigned randomly to incorporate one of two early literacy curricular approaches, Let’s Begin with the Letter People ® or Waterford Early Reading Program ® Level 1, into their current curriculum, the High/ Scope ® Educational Approach, or to use the High/Scope method alone. Results indicated that children in the literacy intervention classrooms demonstrated significantly stronger outcomes in the areas of emergent writing, book and print knowledge, and general reading readiness skills. Minority language status also played a significant role in outcome, regardless of intervention condition. Implications for early childhood literacy interventions, especially important for children of low-income families, are discussed."

We explored the possibility that parent speech provides information about letters, and also that children’s speech reflects their own letter knowledge. By studying conversations transcribed in CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000) between parents and children aged one to five, we found that alphabetic order influenced use of individual letters and letter sequences. The frequency of letters in children’s books influenced parent utterances throughout the age range studied, but children’s utterances only after age two. Conversations emphasized some literacy-relevant features of letters, such as their shapes and association with words, but not letters’ sounds. Describing these patterns and how they change over the preschool years offers important insight into the home literacy environment."

A total of 216 children including 118 with a preschool background were tested at the start of first grade and again approximately eight months later. The Basic Skills Assessment Tool for reading and writing (BASAT) was applied at both measurements. Basic skills at the start of first grade were not better when children had been to preschool but did predict academic success in first grade. Multilevel regression analysis revealed that preschool even had a negative effect on reading and writing at the end of first grade when we controlled for basic literacy skills at the start of first grade. We discuss the use of English in preschool as a possible explanation for the negative effects of preschool.

Frequency refers to the number of shared reading sessions conducted each week as measured by teachers’ written reading logs recorded across the academic year. Features refers to teachers’ extratextual talk about literal, inferential, or print or phonological topics as assessed by analysis of 6 videotaped readings of narrative and informational texts collected across the preschool year. Participants were 28 preschool teachers and 178 children. The children were largely at risk and randomly selected from among those in each classroom to complete longitudinal assessments. In preschool, results showed that the frequency of classroom shared reading was positively and significantly related to children’s receptive vocabulary growth, as was the inclusion of extratextual conversations around the text; only extratextual conversations related to children’s preschool literacy growth. There was no evidence of differential influences of these experiences for children; that is, the relationship between frequency or features and children’s language and literacy development was not moderated by children’s initial skill level. Longitudinally, extratextual talk during preschool shared reading remained associated with children’s vocabulary skills through kindergarten, with trends toward significance extending to 1st grade literacy skills. The frequency of preschool shared reading was not a significant predictor of longitudinal outcomes."

They also completed experimental tasks that tapped their understanding of what constitutes “readable” print. The parents of participants completed a questionnaire regarding their children’s home literacy experiences. The data showed systematic development in children’s understanding of print conventions and English orthography and spelling. Regression analyses indicated that print knowledge was related to early reading skill, even after accounting for variance due to age and phonological awareness. Furthermore, parents’ ratings of the extent of their children’s involvement in activities that led to practice in reading and writing most consistently predicted the development of emerging literacy skills, including understanding of the conventions of the English writing system.

It also discusses the role of house building material and domestic facilities, in addition to parents’ education and occupation, in describing socioeconomic status in developing countries in general, and in the current study. Most of the factors were significantly (ANOVA) related to phonological awareness and reading and writing. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis identified fathers’ education and mothers’ occupation as strong predictors. The home environment variables accounted for 25% of the variance in phonological awareness and 19% in reading and writing ability. Early screening and support of children in the risk zone of becoming poor readers are proposed.

For a critical test of the importance of familiarity with the language in which initial reading is practiced, we took the Zambian situation as a natural experiment and tested effects of a fit between the local language spoken in the homes and playground and the language officially designated as language of instruction. We selected 12 state-funded primary schools from three districts likely to differ in match between children's language and language of instruction. From each school we took at random 10 high- and 10 low achievers, in all 240 pupils, and tested them after 18 months of instruction. Pupils make more progress in word reading fluency in a Zambian language and English when basic reading skills are practiced in the children's most familiar Zambian language. Research into other facets of reading instruction is required to balance various possibilities for increasing efficacy of reading instruction."

A total of 229 families of preschoolers were recruited. Parents completed a survey describing their parenting practices, while children’s literacy skills were directly assessed by using standardized measures. Parents also reported on children’s social development. Factor analyses supported a three-dimensional structure of parenting including the home learning environment, autonomy support/expectations, and management/discipline. Path models showed that the home learning environment predicted literacy skills; specifically, parents’ teaching about letters and sounds was associated with alphabet knowledge, while shared book reading was marginally linked to vocabulary. Management/discipline was uniquely related to selfregulation, while cooperative/compliant skills were associated with the home learning environment, support/expectations, and management/discipline. Findings suggested that parenting could be conceptualized as three relatively independent dimensions, each of which demonstrated domain-specific contributions to early literacy and social skills."

The students’ performance in both languages was investigated at the beginning of kindergarten, and their reading capacities were measured at the end of Grade 1. The data analysis shows that the practice of Creole has no negative impact on success at reading in French. Furthermore, it appears that the students who performed the best in reading were those who were either more competent in French than in Creole, or those who were equally competent in both languages, according to their assessed reading competence. Thus, also discussed is the necessity of early exposure to a language's written code and the contribution that bilingualism makes to learning processes of reading."

Results showed that children’s exposure to books was related to the development of vocabulary and listening comprehension skills, and that these language skills were directly related to children’s reading in grade 3. In contrast, parent involvement in teaching children about reading and writing words was related to the development of early literacy skills. Early literacy skills directly predicted word reading at the end of grade 1 and indirectly predicted reading in grade 3. Word reading at the end of grade 1 predicted reading comprehension in grade 3.

Eleven (11) mothers with tertiary and eleven mothers (11) with secondary education read out loud the book “The three little wolves and the big bad pig” three times, once every three days and the fourth time they narrated it to their 4–5 year olds. All four times, which were recorded by the parents, were done in one-to-one settings, in their homes. Mothers with a tertiary education during the first reading made more extratextual interactions overall, as well as more verbal exchanges in the low-level abstraction categories: organizing the reading, names, clarifying, and in high-level abstraction category relating the story to real life. Mothers with secondary education during the second reading made more extratextual interactions overall, as well as more verbal exchanges in the low-level abstraction categories: clarifying and attention. Both categories of mothers progressively decreased their insertions with subsequent readings. During the first two readings mothers with tertiary education made more extratextual interactions overall, as well as more low- and high-level abstraction insertions, than mothers with secondary education. Children whose mothers had a tertiary education made more insertions overall, including more low- and high-level abstraction extratextual interactions, than the other preschoolers. It was found that all mothers and children had a high percentage of low-level abstraction extratextual interactions.

Although Reading Recovery serves culturally and linguistically diverse students, Clay (2005b) does not directly address these students in her teaching procedures by detailing how teaching practices could be adapted for these students to capitalize on their first language or dialect and their home literacy experiences. The purpose of my study was to examine the professional development experiences of four Reading Recovery teachers who were working with culturally and linguistically diverse students. Specifically, I explored the ways the participating teachers’ beliefs and practices were impacted by their participation in a community of practice focused on developing culturally responsive teaching practices within the framework of Reading Recovery. The following research questions guided this qualitative inquiry: (1) How does participation in a professional development focused on theorizing and implementing culturally responsive teaching practices within the framework of Reading Recovery impact Reading Recovery teachers’ beliefs about teaching culturally and linguistically diverse Reading Recovery students? (2) How are Reading Recovery teachers’ instructional practices with culturally and linguistically diverse students impacted by their participation in professional development focused on learning about and incorporating students’ linguistic, social, and cultural knowledge into the Reading Recovery framework? The theoretical frameworks that informed my inquiry were sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 1934/1986), communities of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, McDermott, & Snyder, 2002), and critical theory (Freire, 1970). Within critical theory, critical race theory (Ladson-Billings, 1998; Yosso, Villalpando, Bernal, & Solorzano, 2001) and culturally relevant pedagogy (Gay, 2010; Ladson-Billings, 1995a, 1995b; Nieto, 2013) further substantiated this study. Through constant comparative analysis (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser & Strauss, 1967) of data collected through preand post-interviews, bi-weekly professional development sessions and debriefings, reflective journals, and artifacts, the teachers’ beliefs about their culturally and linguistically diverse students were explored as well as the way in which teachers’ instructional practices shifted.

This article analyses the access to formal and informal early education of Turkish-origin children in Germany and the influence of these early education contexts on the children's German language acquisition. We use the frequency of stimulating parent–child activities as an indicator of informal education and the attendance in language instruction programmes at preschool as an indicator of formal education. The empirical results show that the frequency of parent–child activities in Turkish-origin families depends on parents’ social background and German language skills. Language instruction programmes in preschools are most frequently used by children who most likely need such programmes: children with low levels of German language skills. For the development of German language skills, parent–child activities seem to be most important."

The authors aimed to assess the predictive power of textual narrative competence on early narrative text writing skills taking into account the impact of spelling ability. Eighty children (M age = 5.3 years, age range = 4.9–5.7 years; SD = 0.29) were followed longitudinally until entering the first grade of primary school. During kindergarten, they were tested with an oral story production task and in first grade with a written story production task. Narratives were evaluated in terms of structure, cohesion and consistency. In the first grade, children were also submitted to a dictation task to evaluate their spelling competence. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed in order to examine narrative competence development, also considering gender differences, and regression analyses were implemented to evaluate the predictive capability of textual abilities expressed by oral narratives on textual abilities expressed by writing. The results showed some significant differences when scores in kindergarten were compared to scores in primary school. Moreover, the ability to tell well-structured, cohesive and consistent stories predicts the ability to write stories with the same qualities in the sample of participants without spelling difficulty. Instead, the predictive link is not apparent considering those children with difficulties in orthographic ability. This research allows us to reflect about how the medium of writing might interfere, on the basis of the level of mastery, with the opportunity to express narrative skills in the transition from the oral to written code. The central role of writing instrument functionality opens the way to practical implications."

In particular, children's active participation is considered key. This study investigated links between maternal beliefs about shared reading strategies and children's readiness to learn to read, mothers' observed shared reading behaviors, and children's vocabulary sizes. Participants were 62 mothers and their preschool children attending Head Start. Mother–child book reading was observed, and mothers' beliefs were measured via self-report and ratings of videotaped vignettes portraying reading strategies. Children's expressive and receptive vocabularies were assessed. Results revealed that dyadic shared reading quality mediated the link between mothers' beliefs and children's expressive, but not receptive, vocabulary. Further, mothers' perceptions of children's readiness to learn to read moderated the link between mother's beliefs and shared reading quality. This evidence highlights the importance of maternal beliefs in guiding behaviors that facilitate preschoolers' vocabulary development."

Even though overwhelming research literature on the subject is available, the majority of this existing work is designed and organized in western contexts i.e. developed countries. Due to that reason, much less is known about the effects of tutorial instructional programmes and educational games on the literacy skills of Arabic speaking kindergarten children. Our study tries to bridge this gap in the existing literature by performing a comparison study of two different instructional programmes on the development of literacy skills amongst 5 to 6 years old kindergarten children in Saudi Arabia. As a result of this study, it was found that educational games were more effective in supporting and facilitating literacy skills of participating kindergarten children compared to tutorial instructional programmes."

The investigation of emergent literacy behaviours of both mothers and toddlers investigated included the examination of phonological awareness and written language awareness. Participants included 15 mother–toddler dyads from middle to upper socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds. The main data collection measures included: (1) home literacy environment observation; (2) shared reading observations; and (3) parent questionnaire. Data were coded and organized into emergent literacy domains, phonological awareness and written language awareness. The results indicate that these mothers engaged in several emergent literacy behaviours with their toddlers during shared-reading interactions. Some of these behaviours were also exhibited by their children. The behaviours observed in mothers and toddlers were related to the written language awareness domain.

The study, started in January 2005, examines the literacy development of eight Malay children in and out of school in kindergarten and subsequently in primary one. As the research unfolds, the principal investigator becomes increasingly aware of the importance of undertaking a similar study on Chinese children given that no comparable study on these children has been done thus far.

The 12 years between these two kindergarten cohorts were characterized by a heightened understanding of the importance of early childhood in the life course and relatedly, substantial increases in public preschool access. Across both cohorts, preschool participation is positively associated with cognitive outcomes at school entry, and although these associations are substantially smaller, they are still present at the end of first grade. We document negative associations between preschool participation and behavioral outcomes. Notably however, these relationships are far less pronounced for the recent cohort. Finally, across both kindergarten cohorts, we document a particularly large positive association between preschool participation and first grade cognitive outcomes for black children.

Girls outperformed boys on tests of emergent literacy. Engagement while listening to books being read was highest for storybooks but there was a sex by condition effect: Boys were less engaged with complex alphabet books than the other book types, whereas girls were less engaged with simple alphabet books than storybooks. During independent reading, both sexes spent significantly more time on-task in the eBook condition but less of their activity involved letter-related behaviours (e.g., saying letter names).

This research suggests three main findings about cumulative disadvantage in reading: (1) Cumulative disadvantage is not the only pathway available for students with early difficulties in reading; (2) recovery is based on alignment of child, home, and school factors; and (3) schools can act as a site of intervention to disrupt the cumulative disadvantage trajectory through the use of high-quality instruction and high-quality intervention."

Numerous researches, including international ones, show the importance of the exercise of such abilities within the kindergarten also for the purpose of preventing the development of learning difficulties and / or real disorders in the subsequent academic career of the child. Furthermore, the implementation of didactic interventions aimed at the development of such cognitive prerequisites favors the increase and / or recovery of the instrumentalities of the writing. In this scenario, it becomes essential to reflect on the methods of early screening that can be activated within the nursery school and on the related assessment tools that can be used. As a consequence, some of the main psychometric instruments published in Italy, from 1999 to date, have been reviewed for the evaluation of the prerequisites of bed-writing skills in students starting from 5 years of age."

Primary caregivers of 78 preschoolers (ages 3–5) participated. Separate hierarchical regression models indicated that after controlling for parental education, total parenting stress significantly predicted general home-based involvement, parent-child interactive reading, and parent-child modeling/monitoring in reading. Neither parental education nor parenting stress significantly predicted parent-child literacy skill building activities, which appeared to be universal among families regardless of education or stress levels. Among all stress factors, parenting stress due to parent-child dysfunctional interaction (PCDI) appeared as the best predictor of general home-based involvement as well as modeling and monitoring in literacy by caregivers, explaining 9% and 6% of additional variance in these behaviors, after parental education was controlled. The implications of these results for research and practice with diverse low-income families are discussed."

1,2514409293,home literacy environment profiles of children with language impairment associations with caregiver and child specific factors,2017,"sherine r tambyraja, mary beth schmitt, kelly farquharson, laura m justice",international journal of language & communication disorders,1,3,33,"Background
Numerous studies suggest a positive relationship between the home literacy environment (HLE) and children's language and literacy skills, yet very little research has focused on the HLE of children with language impairment (LI). Children with LI are at risk for reading difficulties; thus, understanding the nature and frequency of their home literacy interactions is warranted.

Aims
To identify unique HLE profiles within a large sample of children with LI, and to determine relevant caregiver- and child-specific factors that predict children's profile membership.

Methods & Procedures
Participants were 195 kindergarten and first-grade children with LI who were receiving school-based language therapy. Caregivers completed a comprehensive questionnaire regarding their child's HLE, and the extent to which their child engaged in shared book reading, were taught about letters, initiated or asked to be read to, and chose to read independently. Caregivers also answered questions regarding the highest level of maternal education, caregiver history of reading difficulties, and caregiver reading habits. Children completed a language and literacy battery in the fall of their academic year.

Outcomes & Results
Latent profile analyses indicated a three-profile solution, representing high, average and low frequency of the selected HLE indicators. Multinomial regression further revealed that caregivers’ own reading habits influenced children's profile membership, as did child age and language abilities.

Conclusions & Implications
These results highlight the considerable variability in the frequency of home literacy interactions of children with LI. Future work examining relations between familial reading practices and literacy outcomes for children with LI is warranted."

In Malaysia, literacy skills are generally only taught in the classroom. However, research shows that the home and school are overlapping ‘spheres of influence’. Children learn emergent and social literacy practices prior to school age and these are powerful factors towards future success in school. This paper stems from the findings from the Multimodal Community Literacy project, which was a day-long literacy event which used multiliteracies (arts and crafts, songs, videos, movies, and storytelling) to facilitate an understanding of and participation in social literacy practices among working class parents’. The participants comprised administrative staff with young children, aged 2 to 8, from the Institute of Teacher Education in (city), Malaysia. This case study used structured questionnaire triangulated with parent and caregiver interviews. The project assessed family’s understanding, access, frequency and types of social literacy practices applied at home. The findings revealed that parents’ belief in what constituted literacy practices differed from research defined social literacy practices.

Higher reading and writing achievement correlated with engaging in more home literacy activities. Parental help or monitoring of home literacy activities was greater for low-achieving than for high-achieving readers or writers. Children engaged more minutes per week in reading than writing activities at home, but parents provided more help with writing and reported computers were used more for homework than for school literacy instruction.

Organisational climate was measured using the School Climate Index (SCI) developed by Tschannen-Moran, Parish and Dipaola and student achievement was measured by students’ test scores at the Ethiopia General Education Leaving Certificate Examination (GELCE) in the year 2014/15. A total of 32 schools, 973 teachers and 14882 students were involved in the study. Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation, Pearson r correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis were applied for the data analysis. The results indicate that school climate has a significant and positive relationship with student achievement in Ethiopia secondary schools, but nonetheless, a weak one. The collegial leadership, teacher professionalism, and academic press were significantly and moderately correlated to students’ achievement while the community engagement sub scale was not. The four factors used both for the SCI as predictor variables in the regression model were shown to have a significant relationship with student achievement when viewed as a whole, but they generated more varied results when examined individually. Teachers’ professionalism is the most positive predictor of student achievement in Ethiopia secondary schools. Similarly collegial leadership and academic press are also found to be significant predictor of academic achievement. This study found no independent effect of community engagement on student achievement. It is recommended that school leaders should design school improvement plans that entail the school climate construct. School leaders need to find ways of including the community in the life of the school and foster positive relationships with the community. Principals in particular need to be mindful that the climate of a school affect achievement and the former can be enhanced to improve results."

This study examines naturalistic language and literacy teaching by 39 sibling dyads, at two timepoints, when children were ages 2 and 4 (time 1; T1) and again at ages 4 and 6 (time 2; T2). Each family was observed for a total of six 90-minute sessions at both timepoints. First, all sibling-directed teaching sequences were identified, including instances of formal and informal teaching. Second, sequences were coded for evidence of language (i.e., vocabulary, book concepts, songs, phonological awareness) and literacy concepts (i.e., alphabetic principle, reading, writing, spelling). Over 40% of the T1 and T2 teaching sequences involved language and literacy concepts. Older siblings taught the majority of the time at T1 and T2; however, the number of sequences taught by younger siblings increased proportionally over time. Because siblings taught vocabulary concepts significantly most often at both T1 and T2, further analyses were conducted on vocabulary subcategories (i.e., expansion, discussing pictures, relaying word meaning, checking for listener understanding, second-language instruction). Significantly more teaching sequences involved expansion than other vocabulary subcategories at both timepoints. Finally, at T2, literacy concepts (i.e., writing, spelling) were taught significantly more than at T1. Our findings demonstrate that siblings are interested in teaching each other a variety of language and literacy concepts during naturalistic interactions in the home, indicating that siblings contribute to the richness of the home literacy environment."

Semi-structured interviews with parents (N = 8), of children aged between 37 months and 59 months (M = 47.5 months), were used to investigate child interactions and specific parental views and experiences in relation to mathematical practices at home. Thematic analysis was used to explore behaviour relevant to the home numeracy environment. Six recurrent themes from the interview responses were identified: numeracy environment structure, frequency of number-related experiences, levels of number knowledge, technology attitudes, parent-child interactions and social interaction. The diversity of the themes developed in this study illustrate how the home numeracy environment could be influenced by parents' views and experiences of numeracy-related activities, reported behaviours of their child and children's interactions with others."

The development of emergent literacy skills depends upon the literacy environments and experiences of children at home. Children’s home literacy environment is closely related to the development of various aspects of emergent literacy like letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and vocabulary. Dimensions of home literacy environment, such as physical (literacy) environment, child’s own literacy habits, parental literacy habits, parent-child interaction for language and literacy activities, and parental beliefs about literacy, have been reported in literature."

One hundred forty-seven students attending the third year of kindergarten in Jining, China, were assessed on nonverbal IQ, vocabulary breadth and depth, and their knowledge of book titles. Parents also participated in the study by filling out a questionnaire on the frequency of shared book reading and the number of children's books at home, recording their daily parent–child reading activities (diary), and completing the children's title and author recognition checklists. Results of exploratory factor analysis indicated that the measures of print exposure were loading on three interrelated factors. The items measuring the frequency of shared book reading at home along with diary formed one factor, the children's title recognition checklist and number of children's books at home formed a second factor, and children's knowledge of book titles formed a third factor. In addition, the results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that whereas all factors accounted for unique variance (3–6%) in vocabulary breadth, only children's knowledge of book titles predicted vocabulary depth, after controlling for children's age, parents’ education and income, and children's nonverbal IQ. Taken together, these findings suggest that different measures of print exposure may capture different aspects of print exposure and that these aspects may exert a different role in vocabulary breadth and depth."

Data which were collected through semi-structured interviews, document analysis and observations were thematically analysed. Results of the study indicate that parents in King William’s Town, South Africa are not effectively involved in their children’s acquisition of literacy because the parents do not feel appropriately empowered to influence the development of their children’s literacy. The paper also found that shortage of literacy material like newspapers, magazines, story books, and computers militated against parental involvement. The findings reveal a need for parental empowerment in terms of knowledge and skills, understanding and allocation of resources. It also recommended a collaborated effort between schools and parents in the formulation of parental involvement policies and programs. Educators’ worksho..."

In this study, we extend previous work by examining the amount and types of writing-related home practices that parents engage in with their young preschool children. Next, we examined the relation between these home practices and the development of writing skills in 4- and 5-year old preschool children. Correlations between parental teaching activities and child independent activities and letter writing, spelling, and spontaneous writing were statistically significant. NA Results from the multi-level modeling indicated that parental teaching predicted a child’s letter writing, spelling, and spontaneous writing skills whereas child independent practices predicted letter writing and spontaneous writing but not spelling. Results of the current study clearly indicate that practices in the home include writing related activities and that these activities have an impact on children’s writing development.

The data come directly from schools in three countries in SSA. We first describe Literacy Boost and outline the research upon which Literacy Boost was designed. We then summarize briefly the research on two of the dimensions of equity which Literacy Boost seeks to address: the achievement gap between the sexes and the poor access to reading resources experienced by children in rural, developing world settings. Using multivariate regression analysis, we find that Literacy Boost overall had significant positive impact on the reading skills of students. However, for groups that are traditionally disadvantaged (e.g., girls or those with poor access to reading resources), we find no differential impact of Literacy Boost. We consider the implications of using developed world research in developing world settings and examine the implications for future practice in literacy programming across the continent. We then turn back to the literature and reflect on how well research findings from the developed world apply to the developing world, as well as how applicable our own findings are across the sub-Saharan region."

One hundred and forty third-year kindergarten Chinese children (71 girls and 69 boys; mean age = 70.54 months) were assessed on nonverbal IQ, phonological awareness, vocabulary, and word reading. Parents also filled out a questionnaire on their educational level and income, the frequency of engaging in different home literacy-related activities with their child, and their expectations about their child’s reading/school performance. Results of path analysis showed that formal literacy activities predicted phonological awareness and literacy resources at home predicted vocabulary. In addition, family’s SES was a significant predictor of literacy resources at home and parents’ expectations was a significant predictor of all home literacy aspects and of word reading. Results of multiple mediation analysis further showed that the effects of parents’ expectations on word reading were partly mediated by formal literacy experiences and literacy resources at home. In contrast, the effects of literacy resources at home on word reading were fully mediated by the effects of vocabulary on phonological awareness. Taken together, these findings suggest that the links between home literacy environment (including the factors that shape the quantity and quality of the home literacy experiences) and reading in Chinese are not as straightforward as those previously reported in alphabetic languages."

These differences are even wider for children in low-income families. This article aims to examine the extent to which home factors account for variation in early literacy outcomes in the first year of schooling. A total of 72 first graders and their parents from low-income families in Lusaka, Zambia, participated in the study. A self-reported home literacy questionnaire was used to collect home literacy data − parental education, home possessions, reading materials, language awareness, print experience, writing activities, reading activities and teaching letters. Children’s early literacy skills were assessed using four measures: orthography awareness, spelling, vocabulary and math tests. These tests were measured at two points: at the beginning and at the end of the first grade. Results showed that teaching letters was most predictive of literacy outcomes both at the beginning and end of the first year. The study concludes that formal teaching of letters at home is the parents’ greatest strength for supporting literacy in low-income families. Thus, energies for parental involvement should be directed in ways that are culturally practised and manageable by parents for better literacy outcomes."

Design/methodology/approach - The authors use secondary data on policies and trends over the past 40 years for preschool, primary/junior high school, and high school. Findings - The trends over the past 40 years in all areas of rural schooling have been continually upward and strong. While only a low share of rural children attended preschool in the 1980s, by 2014 more than 90 percent of rural children were attending. The biggest achievement in compulsory education is that the rise in the number of primary students that finish grade 6 and matriculate to junior high school. There also was a steep rise of those going to and completing high school. While the successes in upscaling rural education are absolutely unprecedented, there are still challenges. Research limitations/implications - This is descriptive analysis and there is not causal link established between policies and rural schooling outcomes. Practical implications - The authors illustrate one of the most rapid rises of rural education in history and match the achievements up with the policy efforts of the government. The authors also explore policy priorities that will be needed in the coming years to raise the quality of schooling. Originality/value - This is the first paper that documents both the policies and the empirical trends of the success that China has created in building rural education from preschool to high school during the first 40 years of reform (1978-2018). The paper also documents – drawing on the literature and the own research – the achievements and challenges that China still face in the coming years, including issues of gender, urbanization, early childhood education and health and nutrition of students."

Eye movements can even reflect predictive language processing, moving to an object before it is named. Children are also capable of making language-mediated eye movements, even predictive ones, and prediction may be involved in language learning. The present study explored whether eye movements are language-mediated in a more naturalistic task – shared storybook reading. Research has shown that children fixate illustrations during shared storybook reading, ignoring text. The present study used high-precision eye-tracking to replicate this finding. Further, prereader participants showed increased likelihood of fixating relevant storybook illustrations as words were read aloud, indicating that their eye movements were language mediated like the adult participants. Language-mediated eye movements to illustrations were reactive, not predictive, in both participant groups."

Along with the development of electronic technology, many books have changed to the electronic format, and storybooks are no exception. The purpose of this study was to understand which electronic storybook display method is best able to increase children’s attention to the print area. To this end, we modified the electronic storybook’s design and used an eye-tracker to measure children’s visual attention during reading. The study included 76 children between the ages of 4–6 from two northern Taiwanese kindergartens. The kindergarteners were split into three groups: a traditional storybook group, the highlight synchronization group (implicit instruction), and the text-discussion group (explicit instruction). This study was conducted over a 6-week period: one week for pre-tests, four weeks of interventions, and one week for post-tests. The result of pre-test suggested that the northern Taiwanese children spent about 80% of their time looking at the picture area, and about 20% at the print area. The result of week 2, the first week of the intervention stage, showed that, when it came to visual attention invested in the print area, the highlight synchronization groups paid significantly more attention to the print area than the traditional storybook group."

One important context where children may develop these skills is the home environment, and research has found that broad indicators of the home environment and parenting practices are related to the development of children’s EF. However, it is also important to investigate whether parents’ EF-specific practices with their children (e.g., playing concentration games) are related to children’s EF skills. In this study, we developed the Home EF Environment (HEFE) scale and analyzed it using factor analysis with a sample of 120 preschool children and one of their parents in the Unites States. Mean age for children ranged from 38 to 69 months (M = 56.65, SD = 6.54), and 52% were male. Additionally, we analyzed the associations between the parent-reported HEFE scale and children’s EF skills. Factor analysis indicated that EF-specific activities form a distinguishable part of the home environment. Further, a set of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the HEFE scale is related to a global measure of children’s EF over and above the home learning environment and general parenting practices, but not cognitive flexibility or inhibitory control. The potential importance of EF-specific activities in the home environment as well as study implications is addressed in the discussion."

How parents responded to their children’s word reading difficulties in these interactions was coded. Children reported that learning to read was important and offered several different ways that they were learning to read at home, most frequently being their parents reading to/with them, telling them the words, and having them sound out words. Home observations showed that the way parents responded to children’s reading errors was in accordance with the child reports. These results suggest that young children can reflect on their learning process and can be useful informants on literacy practices in the home. They also suggest that young children can isolate parental behaviours that help them learn to read, and that in doing so, may incorporate these parental behaviours into their conceptions of parenting to guide their own behaviours as parents in the future."

One hundred fifty-nine third year kindergarten children (70 girls and 89 boys; Mage = 72.62 months) participated in the study. In kindergarten, they were assessed on emergent literacy skills (vocabulary, phonological awareness, pinyin knowledge, rapid naming), in Grade 1, on word reading, and, in Grade 2, on reading comprehension. In addition, parents filled out a questionnaire on their education and income, the frequency of different HLE activities, the number of children’s books at home, and their expectations, when their children were in kindergarten. Results of structural equation modeling showed that formal literacy experiences predicted reading comprehension through the effects of pinyin knowledge on word reading. Access to literacy resources predicted reading comprehension through the effects of rapid naming, phonological awareness, and vocabulary. Finally, informal literacy experiences did not predict any of the emergent literacy skills or reading outcomes. Our findings provide only partial support of the home literacy model and suggest that the culture in which environmental effects take place may determine what aspects of the home literacy environment contribute to children’s reading performance and what not."

Participants were 28 elementary students from 10 public schools in an urban school district and one urban private school who were randomly placed into treatment and contrast groups. Students in the treatment condition received daily, comprehensive reading instruction in small groups of 1-4 students for approximately 40 minutes per session. A broad array of measures was studied, including phonemic awareness, phonics, word recognition, comprehension, and oral language. Means favored the intervention group on all measures, with moderate to strong effect sizes. Statistically significant differences were found on most measures, including phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, and comprehension. These findings demonstrated that students with moderate ID can learn basic reading skills given consistent, explicit, and comprehensive reading instruction across an extended period of time."

This study explored concurrent changes in levels of parent support and child literacy skills that occurred over the course of the intervention, and examined the impact of pre-intervention parent support and child literacy skills as potential moderators of parent and child outcomes. Cross-lagged structural equation models and follow-up analyses indicated that intervention had the strongest impact on child literacy skills when parents were high on support at the pre-intervention assessment. Conversely, the REDI-Parent program promoted the greatest gains in parent support when parents entered the program with low levels of support. These findings suggest that families may benefit from home visiting school readiness interventions in different ways: child skill acquisition may be greatest when parents are initially high in support, whereas parenting may improve most when parents are initially low in support."

Of 123 preschoolers examined on letter knowledge, 65 underwent training on both letter names and letter sounds in a counterbalanced order. Prior to training, children were more advanced in associating letters with their names than with their sounds and could provide the sound of a letter only if they could name it. However, children learned more easily to associate letters with sounds than with names. Training just on names improved performance on sounds, but the sounds produced were extended (CV) rather than phonemic. Learning sounds facilitated later learning of the same letters’ names, but not vice versa. Training either on names or on sounds improved word recognition and explanation of printed words. Results are discussed with reference to cognitive and societal factors affecting letter knowledge acquisition, features of the Hebrew alphabet and orthography, and educational implications."

The control group was taught the shapes of the letters but not their names. Then both groups were taught the sounds of the letters. Results showed an advantage for the experimental group, but only for beginning-sound letters. Experiment 2 investigated whether training in phonological awareness could boost the learning of letter sounds, particularly middle-sound letters. In addition to learning the names of beginning- and middle-sound letters, children in the experimental group were taught to categorize words according to rhyme and alliteration, whereas controls were taught to categorize the same words semantically. All children were then taught the sounds of the letters. Results showed that children who were given phonological awareness training found it easier to learn letter sounds than controls.

Three groups of approximately 30 children were assigned to one of three conditions: paper alphabet book, alphabet eBook, or storybook control. Book reading sessions composed of three to four children were run twice a week over eight weeks, with child-book behaviours coded at each session. Measures of early reading ability were collected pre and post-intervention. Children in all conditions improved over time in emergent literacy but no significant differences between conditions were found. Children using paper alphabet books were more likely to say letter names, and their time oriented to the books predicted post-test letter-name and phonological awareness after controlling for pre-test scores. In contrast, time oriented to the alphabet eBooks made no prediction to post-test sores.

In this study, we investigated critical factors in the development of letter-writing skills using exploratory item response models to simultaneously account for variance in responses due to differences between students and between letters. Letter-writing skills were assessed in 415 preschool children aged 3 to 5 years. At the student level, we examined the contribution of letter-name knowledge, letter-sound knowledge, and phonological awareness to letter-writing skills. At the letter level, we examined seven intrinsic and extrinsic factors in understanding how preschool children learn to write alphabet letters: first letter of name, letters in name, letter order, textual frequency, number of strokes, symmetry, and letter type. Results indicated that variation in letter-writing skills was accounted for more by differences between students rather than by differences between letters, with most of the variability accounted for by letter-name knowledge and age. Although significant, the contribution of letter-sound knowledge and phonological awareness was relatively small. Student-level mechanisms underlying the acquisition of letter-writing skills are similar to the mechanisms underlying the learning of letter sounds. However, letter characteristics, which appear to play a major role in the learning of letter names and letter sounds, did not appear to influence learning how to write letters in a substantial way. The exception was if the letter was in the child’s name."

Rasch analysis showed that the four components of alphabet knowledge did work together as a unidimensional construct, indicating all alphabet tasks administered were measuring the same underlying skill. With regard to difficulty of tasks, letter recognition was easier than letter naming, which in turn was easier than letter sounds, and uppercase letter names were easier than lowercase letter names. Most notably, most of the alphabet tasks overlapped, and the Rasch models for the single tasks were no more reliable than the combined measure. This suggests that these alphabetic tasks do not measure distinct skills but are instead indicators of a single ability. Consequently, we support the conceptualization of alphabet knowledge as a unitary construct, and suggest that those assessing and teaching alphabet knowledge in preschool use tests and methods that combine the various alphabetic tasks rather than separating them. These combined assessments will be more likely to capture the range of abilities within a preschool sample and avoid the floor and ceiling effects that have so often complicated early literacy research."

The main goal of the first study was to examine whether reading level at age 8 can be predicted on the basis of a skill very rarely examined in longitudinal studies: phonemic discrimination. Two groups of French-speaking children were selected based on their phonemic discrimination skills at age 5: a group with low skills and a group with average to high skills in that domain. These two groups were respectively classified as being ""at-risk"" and ""not-at-risk"" for reading acquisition, and were matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ and vocabulary. Phonemic discrimination was found to be an important predictor of reading acquisition. Indeed, the two groups defined at age 5 based on their phonemic discrimination skills obtained significantly different reading scores at age 8, and the proportion of children with reading disabilities was higher in the at-risk group than in the not-at-risk group. The main goal of the second study was to assess whether reading skills at age 8 could be predicted by the ""classical"" predictors of reading acquisition assessed at age 5: pre-reading level, letter-name knowledge, phonemic segmentation and phonological short-term-memory (STM). A high proportion of the variance in reading at age 8 (52.8%) was predicted by these predictors, with four contributing unique and significant portions of that variance: pre-reading level, letter-name knowledge for vowels (not for consonants), phonemic segmentation (not syllabic segmentation) and phonological STM."

Previous work has demonstrated that white matter connectivity along the arcuate fasciculus AF is predicted by reading skill and that crossmodal processing particularly activates the posterior STS pSTS. However, the relationship between this crossmodal activation and white matter integrity has not been previously reported. We investigated the interrelationship of crossmodal integration, both in terms of behavioral performance and pSTS activity, with AF tract coherence using a rhyme judgment task in a group of 47 children with a range of reading abilities. We demonstrate that both response accuracy and pSTS activity for crossmodal auditory-visual rhyme judgments was predictive of fractional anisotropy along the left AF. Unimodal auditory-only or visual-only pSTS activity was not significantly related to AF connectivity. Furthermore, activity in other reading-related ROIs did not show the same AV-only AF coherence relationship, and AV pSTS activity was not related to connectivity along other language-related tracts. This study is the first to directly show that crossmodal brain activity is specifically related to connectivity in the AF, supporting its role in phoneme-grapheme integration ability. More generally, this study helps to define an interdependent neural network for reading-related integration."

1,2103366774,the neural signature of orthographic phonological binding in successful and failing reading development,2011,leo blomert,neuroimage,1,150,71,"Abstract NA NA Learning to read in alphabetic orthographies starts with learning a script code consisting of letter–speech sound pairs. Although children know which letters belong to which speech sounds within months, it takes much longer to automatically integrate them into newly constructed audiovisual objects. This extended learning process corresponds with observations that reliable letter and word specific activations in the fusiform cortex also occur relatively late in reading development. The present review discusses electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies of the nature and mechanisms involved in letter–speech sound integration in normal and dyslexic readers. It is demonstrated that letter–speech sound associations do not develop in parallel with visual letter recognition but immediately work in concert to form orthographic–phonological bonds which remain active even in experienced reading. Effective letter–speech sound integration may be necessary for reliable letter recognition to develop. In contrast, it is this basic integration of letters and speech sounds which poses an immediate problem for beginning dyslexic readers, and remains problematic in adult dyslexic readers. It is hypothesized that a specific orthographic–phonological binding deficit may not only act as a proximal cause for reading deficits in dyslexia, but may also explain the notorious lack of reading fluency. Finally, it is suggested that similar integrated audiovisual representations may also exist for larger grain-sizes in the same posterior occipitotemporal/inferoparietal network as identified for orthographic–phonological integration of letters and speech sounds."

The present study examined Hebrew, where variations in the phonetic iconicity of letter names are minimal. In a study of 391 Israeli children with a mean age of 5 years, 10 months, we used multilevel models to examine the factors that are associated with knowledge of letter sounds. One set of factors involved letter names: Children sometimes attributed to a letter a consonant–vowel sound consisting of the first phonemes of the letter’s name. A second set of factors involved contrast: Children had difficulty when there was relatively little contrast in shape between one letter and others. Frequency was also important, encompassing both child-specific effects, such as a benefit for the first letter of a child’s forename, and effects that held true across children, such as a benefit for the first letters of the alphabet. These factors reflect general properties of human learning."

1,2158385823,the long learning route to abstract letter units,2009,g brian thompson,cognitive neuropsychology,1,11,63,"This is a review of theory and evidence on how abstract letter units (ALUs) are initially learnt by the developing individual. Despite the predominance of the lower-case form of letters in the print environment, naming identification of upper case has precedence over lower case among preschool children. Such children showed a significant lag in extending their categories of upper-case variants to include the corresponding lower-case forms that are visually dissimilar. As late as 11 years of age children gave longer naming latencies for the lower-case than the upper-case forms. Initial learning of ALUs proceeded slowly over many months, consistent with the “common contexts” hypothesis but not consistent with the early acquisition predicted by the “common letter name” hypothesis. Evidence from cross-case transfer in a training experiment indicated that prior to acquiring full use of ALUs the children had formed representations of words that were letter based but specific to lower-case forms."

We assessed the contribution of maternal spelling support in predicting children’s word spelling level beyond the contribution of three internal child measures: early literacy (phonological awareness and letter naming), private speech while spelling (self-directed talk), and behavioral regulation. Children’s private speech during spelling—their tool to regulate thinking—has not yet been studied in the early literacy context. Fifty Israeli preschoolers (M = 68.66 months) of middle-high SES were videotaped while spelling words with their mothers and while spelling these words independently. Children’s phonological awareness, letter naming, and behavioral regulation were assessed individually. Results showed that children’s internal measures (early literacy, private speech while spelling, and behavioral regulation) predicted children’s early spelling (63 % of the variance), and the external measure of maternal spelling support added uniquely (12 %), together explaining 75 % of the variance in children’s spelling level. Findings suggested that mothers adjust their spelling support to meet young children’s existing literacy skills but also coach children to strive toward higher spelling performance. Furthermore, the study illuminates the role of a new measure in the context of children’s early literacy—private speech during spelling."

Though researchers continue to identify more and more symptoms of deficiencies, they have, to date, come up with but few solutions. Reading instruction traditionally begins with the particular components of a specific language. In this study, we investigate a method that begins with general, basic reading components common to all written alphabetical languages, including musical notation. We propose to introduce reading by using an original and simple musical vehicle, the Toy Musical Notes (TMN) method. After creating a primary reading scheme through music, verbal reading becomes much easier. Our method was tested on 150 preschool children, who participated in three intervention programs: TMN, conventional music, and a control group, which had a non-musical intervention program. Preand posttests were administered with follow-up assessments in reading development conducted in the first grade. The results reflected significant achievements for the TMN group on all reading parameters: number of mistakes, vocal reading time, velocity, and comprehension. Applying this method allowed us to use children’s natural musical interest to help them learn to read and comprehend better."

Reading, one of the most important cultural inventions of human society, critically depends on posterior brain areas of the left hemisphere in proficient adult readers. In children, this left hemispheric cortical specialization for letter strings is typically detected only after approximately 1 y of formal schooling and reading acquisition. Here, we recorded scalp electrophysiological (EEG) brain responses in 5-y-old (n = 40) prereaders presented with letter strings appearing every five items in rapid streams of pseudofonts (6 items per second). Within 2 min of recording only, letter strings evoked a robust specific response over the left occipito-temporal cortex at the predefined frequency of 1.2 Hz (i.e., 6 Hz/5). Interindividual differences in the amplitude of this electrophysiological response are significantly related to letter knowledge, a preschool predictor of later reading ability. These results point to the high potential of this rapidly collected behavior-free measure to assess reading ability in developmental populations. These findings were replicated in a second experiment (n = 26 preschool children), where familiar symbols and line drawings of objects evoked right-lateralized and bilaterally specific responses, respectively, showing the specificity of the early left hemispheric dominance for letter strings. Collectively, these findings indicate that limited knowledge of print in young children, before formal education, is sufficient to develop specialized left lateralized neuronal circuits, thereby pointing to an early onset and rapid impact of left hemispheric reentrant sound mapping on posterior cortical development."

Two quasi-experimental studies were implemented. Study 1 consisted of a treatment and a control group of young children and Study 2 consisted of two treatment groups and a control group. In both studies, the treatment groups received a 5 week intervention scheme with several morphological awareness activities. In Study 2, a second treatment group received an intervention scheme with activities which combined morphological and phonological awareness. Both studies’ findings showed that the treatment groups which received morphological awareness instruction or a blended instruction on morphological and phonological awareness improved the morphological awareness abilities more than the control group. There were small or no transfer effects on the improvement of print knowledge and vocabulary. However, Study 2 showed that phonological awareness abilities improved only in the treatment group which received the blended instruction. According to the present findings, the teaching of morphemes in Kindergarten is beneficial for morphological awareness improvement, but it has to be combined with other early literacy activities in order to have broader effects on young children’s literacy development."

The impact of these factors on the alphabet knowledge of students with significant cognitive disabilities is unknown. The purpose of this preliminary investigation was to explore the impact of three factors that might influence uppercase alphabet knowledge among students with significant cognitive disabilities: own name, letter order in the alphabet string, and letter frequency. Archival data documenting identification of each of the 26 uppercase letters of the alphabet for 131 8- to 21-year-old students were analyzed using a multilevel logistic regression model. While the use of extant data has limitations, results indicated that own-name advantage gave students a 10% greater likelihood of knowing the first letter of their own first name/nickname than any other alphabet letter. Letter-order analysis showed there were differences between letters found earlier in the alphabet string versus those that were found later in the alphabet string; however, the results were not statistically significant. Letter-frequency analysis did not reveal a significant impact of frequency on letter name knowledge in this sample. The findings provide preliminary evidence that at least some of the factors that influence alphabet knowledge in young children without disabilities also impact students with significant cognitive disabilities and point to the need for more research in this area."

Recent studies have shown a strong link between the knowledge of letters at early ages and the decoding processes. Our study deepens into the learning process of the Spanish alphabet code, focused on the graphemes, and analyzes the predictive power of knowing of letters for the decoding abilities in initial reading. To this end, the research relies on a longitudinal prospective methodology and makes use of standardised instruments (PROLEC-R and BIL) applied to 362 students aged 4 and 5. The data obtained are analysed through multiple regression, using structural equation models. Our research outlines the relevance of learning the sequence of graphemes from early ages, differentiating the sequence of learning in Spanish with respect to English language. In Spanish, the learning sequence of the graphemes is independent of the learning sequence of phonemes. Moreover, this article emphasizes the importance of a learning sequence of these letters, in order to foresee the development of the decoding abilities. This study concludes that the early educational practices that take into account the letters name and phoneme, as well as the concrete sequence in graphemes learning, optimise the reading performance of Spanish speaking children."

Second, the unreliability of phonological cues in Chinese along with the fact that word building relies heavily on lexical compounding in Chinese makes morphological awareness particularly important for early reading development. Third, two different scripts (simplified, traditional) have different characteristics and strengths and weaknesses in relation to teaching and learning Chinese. Fourth, learning Chinese may strengthen both segmental and suprasegmental phonological sensitivity and even promote basic visual skills, potential cognitive advantages.

Nonlinguistic rhythm, lexical-stress sensitivity and metrical-stress sensitivity, along with phonological awareness, vocabulary, nonverbal intelligence, and reading aloud, were assessed on five occasions. Results suggest that prosody abilities have different developmental trajectories and that prosody explains unique variance in reading beyond that explained by other factors. There was some evidence that the contribution of each prosody skill occurred at different phases in reading development.

Here we propose that orthographic depth is a conglomerate of two separate constructs: the complexity of print-to-speech correspondences and the unpredictability of the derivation of the pronunciations of words on the basis of their orthography. We show that on a linguistic level, these two concepts can be dissociated. Furthermore, we make different predictions about how the two concepts would affect skilled reading and reading acquisition. We argue that refining the definition of orthographic depth opens up new research questions. Addressing these can provide insights into the specific mechanisms by which language-level orthographic properties affect cognitive processes underlying reading."

In the present study, we investigated whether similar parafoveal effects can be found in children using the boundary eye tracking method. Children and adults read sentences in German with embedded target nouns which were presented in original, pseudohomophone (PsH), transposed-letter (TL), lower-case and control conditions to assess phonological and orthographic preview effects. We found evidence of PsH preview benefit effects for children. We also found TL preview benefit effects for adults, while children only showed these effects under specific conditions. Results are consistent with the developmental view that reading initially depends on phonological processes and that orthographic processes become increasingly important."
1,2063050158,reading difficulties in spanish adults with dyslexia,2015,"paz suarezcoalla, fernando cuetos",annals of dyslexia,1,15,64,"Recent studies show that dyslexia persists into adulthood, even in highly educated and well-read people. The main characteristic that adults with dyslexia present is a low speed when reading. In Spanish, a shallow orthographic system, no studies about adults with dyslexia are available; and it is possible that the consistency of the orthographic system favours the reading fluency. The aim of this study was to get an insight of the reading characteristics of Spanish adults with dyslexia and also to infer the reading strategies that they are using. For that purpose, a group of 30 dyslexics (M age = 32 years old) and an age-matched group of 30 adults without reading disabilities completed several phonological and reading tasks: phonological awareness tasks, rapid automatic naming, lexical decision, word and pseudoword reading, letter detection and text reading. The results showed that highly educated Spanish dyslexics performed significantly worse than the control group in the majority of the tasks. Specifically, they showed difficulties reading long pseudowords, indicating problems in automating the grapheme–phoneme rules, but they also seem to present difficulties reading words, which indicate problems with the lexical route. It seems that the Spanish dyslexic adults, as in deep orthographies, continue having difficulties in phonological awareness tasks, rapid naming and reading."

We recorded eye movements of German and English children and adults while reading closely matched sentences, each including a target word manipulated for length and frequency. Results showed differential word recognition processes for both developing and skilled readers. Children of the two orthographies did not differ in terms of total word processing time, but this equal outcome was achieved quite differently. Whereas German children relied on small-unit processing early in word recognition, English children applied small-unit decoding only upon rereading—possibly when experiencing difficulties in integrating an unfamiliar word into the sentence context. Rather unexpectedly, cross-linguistic differences were also found in adults in that English adults showed longer processing times than German adults for nonwords. Thus, although orthographic consistency does play a major role in reading development, cross-linguistic differences are detectable even in skilled adult readers."
1,2079857800,inflectional morphological awareness and word reading and reading comprehension in greek,2015,"kyriakoula m rothou, susana padeliadu",applied psycholinguistics,1,15,32,"The study explored the contribution of two aspects of inflectional morphological awareness, verb inflection and noun-adjective inflection, to word reading and reading comprehension in the Greek language, which is an orthographically transparent language. Participants (120 first graders, 123 second graders, 126 third graders) were given two oral language experimental tasks of inflectional morphological awareness. Furthermore, phonological awareness, receptive vocabulary, expressive vocabulary, decoding, and reading comprehension were evaluated. It was revealed that noun-adjective inflectional morphology contributed significantly to decoding only in first grade, while verb inflectional morphology had a significant contribution to reading comprehension in third grade. It is interesting that inflectional morphological awareness did not predict reading skills for second graders. Phonological awareness was a firm predictor of word reading in all grades and made a unique contribution in Grades 2 and 3. Finally, in all grades, receptive vocabulary was a steady predictor of reading comprehension, whereas expressive vocabulary predicted only first-grade reading comprehension. It is suggested that inflectional morphological awareness may be an important predictor of early reading in a language with a shallow orthography and a rich morphology."
1,2100681908,alphabetism in reading science,2014,david l share,frontiers in psychology,1,12,50,"There has been mounting concern among social scientists that conclusions from studies conducted on highly educated populations from affluent European cultures may have limited applicability to human behavior in general (Henrich et al., 2010). Similar reservations have also been voiced in the fields of language (Evans and Levinson, 2009) and literacy (Share, 2008a; Frost, 2012). Reading research, in particular, has been overwhelmingly dominated by work on English, which appears to be an outlier among European alphabets (Seymour et al., 2003; Share, 2008a). I have argued that because spelling–sound relations are so complex in English orthography, much of reading research has been confined to a narrow Anglocentric research agenda addressing theoretical and applied issues with only limited relevance for a universal science of reading and literacy.

My intention here is not to reiterate my 2008 arguments or even expand them, but to move on to another major obstacle to progress. Before moving on, however, I would like to add a note of optimism to the Anglocentrism debate. In recent years, interest in other languages has indeed begun to emerge from the shadows probably because the scientific community of Anglo-American reading researchers has felt itself “come of age” as a substantial body of well-replicated and converging findings has coalesced in recent years, at least on several key topics such as word identification and dyslexia (Vellutino et al., 2004; Snowling and Hulme, 2005; DeHaene, 2009; Rayner et al., 2012). The field is now witnessing important first steps toward universal models of reading (Perfetti, 2003; Perfetti et al., 2005; Ziegler and Goswami, 2005; Frost, 2012) as well as a growing number of linguistically and grammatologically informed studies emerging outside the confines of English and other European alphabets (Nag and Perfetti, 2014; Saiegh-Haddad and Joshi, 2014; Verhoeven and Perfetti, 2014). It is still the case, nonetheless, that the theoretical and applied frameworks developed for English are all too frequently being applied to other languages and writing systems without due consideration for linguistic and writing system diversity. Almost all publications by English-language researchers continue to omit any “…in English” qualification in the titles of their papers—“A New Whiz-Bang+++ Model of Learning to Read”… in English?—as if the results of studies conducted in English alone enjoy the privileged status of universal applicability, unlike researchers investigating other languages who are obliged to qualify their findings by adding the “…in Chinese/Arabic/Korean etc.” disclaimer which automatically demarcates the findings as language-specific and hence not necessarily universally applicable.

Here, I focus on yet another “-ism,” which I call “alphabetism”; the belief that alphabetic writing systems are inherently superior to non-alphabetic systems, and which, like Anglocentrism, has also stymied psychologists' and educators' thinking about learning to read across diverse writing systems. Here too, I join other scholars who have also expressed concerns about “alphabetolatry,” or alphabetic “supremacism” (e.g., Rogers, 1995). Looking around the globe, it is apparent that most individuals do not acquire literacy in a European alphabet, yet in many parts of the (non-European) world, the belief that alphabetic orthographies are the ideal has led to calls to alphabetize or discard non-alphabetic scripts. Needless to say, these proposals have profound ramifications for instruction and curriculum.

In the past, many influential Western scholars explicitly argued that alphabets are inherently superior to non-alphabetic writing systems (Taylor, 1883; Gelb, 1963; Havelock, 1982). The shelves of most college libraries abound with volumes whose very titles idealize the alphabet (e.g., Diringer's The Alphabet: A Key to the History of Mankind; Moorhouse's Triumph of the Alphabet). When reading researchers today seek enlightenment on the subject of writing systems they refer to Gelb—the founding father of the field of “grammatology” (Gelb, 1963). Like Taylor (1883) before him, Gelb (1963) propounded an evolutionary view of writing system history from “primitive” pre-alphabetic systems to alphabetic. Consistent with the “ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny” idea, Gelb's inexorable “three great steps [logographic-to-syllabic-to-alphabetic] by which writing evolved from the primitive stages to a full alphabet” (p. 203) was embraced by almost all reading researchers, despite its repudiation by subsequent scholarship in the field of writing systems research (Mattingly, 1985; Olson, 1989; Daniels, 1992, in press; Rogers, 2005; Coulmas, 2009). Foremost among these, perhaps, was Ferreiro in her Piagetian classic Literacy before Schooling (Ferreiro and Teberosky, 1979) and, subsequently, a series of stage-oriented theories of reading and writing development (Piagetian and non-Piagetian alike) all referring to pre-alphabetic and alphabetic stages (Gough and Hillinger, 1980; Marsh et al., 1981; Frith, 1985; Ehri, 2005). It needs to be pointed out, however, that the “culture” of alphabetism, like culture in general, is often “invisible”; its presence more often discernible in acts of omission rather than commission. Nonetheless, this alphabetic bias is ubiquitous and is manifest in;


1. Unqualified generalizations about reading “across languages” and/or “across orthographies” in papers that refer almost exclusively to English or to European alphabets (Ziegler and Goswami, 2005; Goswami, 2010; Ziegler et al., 2010; Caravolas et al., 2013; Ehri, 2014).


2. Implicit or explicit acceptance of Gelb's long-discarded evolutionary theory in leading texts on reading development aimed at educators,… “Taking the final step toward the creation of a true alphabetic writing system, the Greeks assigned a symbol to each consonant and vowel of their language… In many ways, the individual development of the children who are discovering the alphabetic principle in English writing recapitulates human history,” (Moats, 2000, pp. 82–83).


3. Even the most up-to-date and authoritative texts on the psychology of reading (e.g., DeHaene, 2009; Rayner et al., 2012) continue to regurgitate Gelb's views.



“[I]n an evolutionary sense, the alphabet is the “fittest…” p. 37”; The history of writing suggests a clear evolutionary trend…These systems evolved to a logographic system, which in turn evolved to syllabic systems and finally to alphabetic systems…Such an evolutionary argument suggests that alphabets are fitter (in the Darwinian sense)… Rayner et al. (2012, pp. 46–47).


4. Reference to non-alphabetic systems as imperfect or defective (e.g., Hannas, 2003; Rayner et al., 2012) as well as attempts to reframe non-alphabetic systems such as the Brahmi-derived Indic (abugidic/aksharik) scripts as alphabetic (Rimzhim et al., 2014).



…“The Semitic writing systems…and the languages of India still incompletely represent vowels. p 36… In this sense, many of these scripts are not fully alphabetic.” Rayner et al. p. 37.

“The Phonecian system, however, was not perfect. It failed to represent all vowels… It was the Greeks who finally created the alphabet as we know it… For the first time in the history of mankind, the alphabet allowed the Greeks to have a complete graphic inventory of their language sounds.” (DeHaene, 2009, p. 193).

“The basic difference between Western alphabetic and East Asian syllabic writing acts on several levels to promote or inhibit creativity, particularly that associated with breakthroughs in science… syllabic literacy entails a diminished propensity for abstract and analytical thought… Certain Asian characteristics credited with blocking creativity, such as conservative political and social institutions and group-oriented behavior, derive in part from effects that the orthography has had on the minds of individuals,” (Hannas, 2003, p. 203).


5. The use of alphabetic terminology (e.g., letters, graphemes) to describe and label the functional architecture (and even the anatomical brain structures) of reading (“letter detectors,” “letterbox area,” “universal letter shapes,” DeHaene, 2009) purported to be universal in reading. Whereas the concept of a letter (or grapheme) is widely used (but not entirely unproblematic) in European alphabets, it has questionable applicability to many writing systems such as Chinese characters, Japanese Kanji, Brahmi-derived Indic aksharas or Mayan glyphs. It has even been suggested that the notion of the “phoneme” as the fundamental unit of analysis of speech may be an artifact of West European alphabetic literacy (Daniels, in press).



Although some initial thoughts have been offered as to when an alphabet may or may not be the appropriate orthography (e.g., Perfetti and Harris, 2013), this topic is new to the agenda of reading science. Some historical background on the alphabet provides a valuable perspective on this issue."

This review focuses on the question of whether these different behavioral manifestations are associated with different functional neuroanatomical manifestations. It provides a review and critique of cross-linguistic brain imaging studies of developmental dyslexia. In addition, it includes an analysis of state-of-the-art functional neuroanatomical models of developmental dyslexia together with orthography-specific predictions derived from these models.

A test battery of tasks with a complete crossing of the two phonological awareness facets was given to 364 children aged four, along with a test battery with tasks measuring cognitive abilities (Gf, Visual, Verbal). A “correlated trait-correlated method minus one” measurement model fit the data well, and supported the proposed model with two dimensions of phonological awareness. Further analyses demonstrated that the phonological tasks can be subsumed under a dominating general phonological awareness factor and orthogonal narrow factors representing the processing and linguistic complexity factors. A structural equation model in which the linguistic and processing complexity factors were regressed on Gf showed that Gf was highly related to the processing complexity factors but not to the linguistic factors. This suggests that the well-established impact of Gf on reading skills is mediated through phonological awareness. The Verbal factor was related to the linguistic complexity factors when Gf was partialed out but not to the processing complexity factors. The Visual factor did not relate to any of the phonological factors. These results support the view that the Verbal and Visual factors are modality specific, and do not represent general processing capacity."

Some authors maintain that, given the transparency of the reading system, non-lexical reading is the strategy followed predominantly by Spanish readers and for that reason these models are not appropriate to explain alexias (acquired dyslexias) in Spanish. Other authors, consider that since several cases of phonological, surface and deep alexia have been reported, dual-route reading models are applicable to Spanish in the same way that to the irregular writing systems. In order to contrast these two points of view, an analysis of the two main factors that influence the reading is made: characteristics of the Spanish orthography and characteristics of the Spanish readers. It is conclude that, (1) Due to its transparency, non-lexical reading represents -as in other transparent orthographies- the initial reading strategy in Spanish; (2) the ""reading threshold"" (i.e., time required to become literate) is lower in Spanish because there are no irregular words to learn; (3) as reading experience increases, speed increases and lexical reading becomes used more; (4) Given the characteristics of the Spanish reading system, it is understandable that frequency of deep dyslexia is so low."

One hundred and forty-one 5-year-old kindergarten children from Hong Kong, whose first language (L1) was Cantonese and second language (L2) was English, were administered tests of phonological awareness, letter knowledge, English vocabulary, spelling and English word reading at three time points (T1, T2 and T3) at 3-month intervals over a 6-month period. Nonverbal IQ was included as a control variable. The results showed that phonological awareness, letter knowledge and English vocabulary at T1 all predicted English word reading (T3) through spelling (T2). Further mediation analyses showed that, for phonological awareness and English vocabulary, full mediation effects were found. For letter knowledge, a partial mediation effect was observed. These results suggest that, in Chinese ESL kindergarteners, reading-related predictors foster word reading via spelling, a process that intersects phonology, orthography and semantics. Practical implications of these findings were also discussed."

Here we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine at what processing level the deficits in dyslexia emerge during a discrete-naming task. Dyslexic and skilled adult control readers performed a primed object-naming task, in which the relationship between the prime and the target was manipulated along perceptual, semantic and phonological dimensions. A 3×2 design that crossed Relationship Type (Visual, Phonemic Onset, and Semantic) with Relatedness (Related and Unrelated) was used. An attenuated N/P190 – indexing early visual processing – and N300 – which index late visual processing – was observed to pictures preceded by perceptually related (vs. unrelated) primes in the control but not in the dyslexic group. These findings suggest suboptimal processing in early stages of object processing in dyslexia, when integration and mapping of perceptual information to a more form-specific percept in memory take place. On the other hand, both groups showed an N400 effect associated with semantically related pictures (vs. unrelated), taken to reflect intact integration of semantic similarities in both dyslexic and control readers. We also found an electrophysiological effect of phonological priming in the N400 range – that is, an attenuated N400 to objects preceded by phonemic related primes vs. unrelated – while it showed a more widespread distributed and more pronounced over the right hemisphere in the dyslexics. Topographic differences between groups might have originated from a word form encoding process with different characteristics in dyslexics compared to control readers."

We describe recent research in mapping the development of neural systems underlying these reading-related capacities, and their relevant gene-brain-behavior underpinnings. We consider the impact of cross-linguistic and/or multilingual experience on the development of the brain’s reading circuitry.

Results showed that the ORF passages measured the same underlying construct, but some passages stood out regarding the invariance pattern. The oral reading fluency growth curve models demonstrated a linear growth in grades 2 and 3 and a nonlinear growth in grades 4 and 5. Initial individual differences varied more than growth rates, which for all were positive but largest in grades 3 and 4. High relative stability in the ORF measure was found across grades. The concurrent and predictive relations of the ORF measure on the Norwegian national reading tests were moderate to strong (range = .44–.75).

While individuals with difficulties in reading and spelling (i.e., developmental dyslexia) are known to experience deficient phoneme discrimination (i.e., segmental phonology), findings concerning their prosodic processing (i.e., suprasegmental phonology) are controversial. Because there are no behavior-independent studies on the underlying neural correlates of prosodic processing in dyslexia, these controversial findings might be explained by different task demands. To provide an objective behavior-independent picture of segmental and suprasegmental phonological processing in impaired literacy acquisition, we investigated event-related brain potentials during passive listening in typically and poor-spelling German school children. For segmental phonology, we analyzed the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) during vowel length discrimination, capturing automatic auditory deviancy detection in repetitive contexts. For suprasegmental phonology, we analyzed the Closure Positive Shift (CPS) that automatically occurs in response to prosodic boundaries. Our results revealed spelling group differences for the MMN, but not for the CPS, indicating deficient segmental, but intact suprasegmental phonological processing in poor spellers. The present findings point towards a differential role of segmental and suprasegmental phonology in literacy disorders and call for interventions that invigorate impaired literacy by utilizing intact prosody in addition to training deficient phonemic awareness."

This study examined the development of stress sensitivity and its relationship with word reading. Previous research has rarely measured phoneme and stress sensitivity in the same task, making a direct comparison of the contribution between the two in reading development difficult.

Methods
Participants were native English-speaking adults and children at ages of 6, 8, and 10 years (N = 24, 22, 22, and 24, respectively). A lexical decision task was used to measure both stress and phoneme sensitivity. Oral vocabulary, phoneme awareness, and word reading were assessed.

Results
Stress sensitivity accounted for unique variance in reading over and above vocabulary and phoneme awareness in 6-year-olds. Both adults and children had better phoneme sensitivity than stress sensitivity.

Conclusions
These findings highlight the unique contribution of stress sensitivity in reading development. The current study made a novel contribution to studying the relationship between prosody and literacy by utilising a task that is able to assess children's stress and phoneme sensitivity simultaneously.


What is already known about this topic

Prosody plays an important role in literacy acquisition across a variety of languages with word stress.
Phoneme awareness as measured by the phoneme deletion task is one of the strongest predictors of reading development in English.
Stress sensitivity may contribute to reading via vocabulary development, rime awareness, phoneme awareness, and morphological awareness.


What this paper adds

Stress sensitivity made a unique contribution to word reading over and above oral vocabulary and phoneme awareness for 6-year-old children.
Both stress and phoneme sensitivity was measured within the same task using the same set of materials.
Both children and adults showed better phoneme sensitivity compared to stress sensitivity.


Implications for theory, policy, or practice

Models delineating the relationship between prosody and literacy should consider unique variance explained by stress sensitivity in reading development.
Children learning to read in English may need longer literacy exposure to develop better stress sensitivity because of the lack of regularity in English stress.
Stress sensitivity may contribute to word reading given that it may help children understand stress assignment and learn unfamiliar stress representation as well as orthographic stress regularities."

The aim of the present study was: (1) to examine Spoken Arabic (SpA) and Standard Arabic (StA) voweled and unvoweled word reading among native-speaking sixth graders with developmental dyslexia; and (2) to determine whether SpA reading ability among children with dyslexia predicts StA reading fluency in the two orthographies: voweled and unvoweled. A comparison was made to three age groups of typically developing children: a group matched by chronological age, a group of children who are two years younger, and a group of children who are 4 years younger. Findings show that diglossia has a strong impact on reading ability in dyslexic children. Moreover, vowelization plays a pivotal role in the reading ability of Arabic-speaking children with dyslexia in both SpA and StA. This role is evident in the different performance patterns of dyslexic participants as compared with controls on word-reading accuracy and fluency for SpA versus StA. Finally, StA word-reading fluency appears to depend on and to be reliably and powerfully predicted by SpA word-level reading ability. These results underscore the role of diglossia and vowelization in the manifestation of dyslexia in Arabic-speaking children."

Bilinguals were not expected to fail in English measures, and their gap with monolinguals would be expected to be limited to the instructional language, owing to underexposure. All participants were enrolled in Italian primary schools (fourth and fifth grades). A non-verbal reasoning task and Italian and English literacy tasks were administered. The Italian battery included word and non-word reading (speed and accuracy), word and non-word writing, and reading comprehension; the English battery included similar tasks, except for the non-word writing. Bilingual children performed similarly to typical readers in English tasks, whereas in Italian tasks, their performance was similar to that of typical readers in reading speed but not in reading accuracy and writing. Children with dyslexia underperformed compared with typically developing children in all English and Italian tasks, except for reading comprehension in Italian. Profile analysis and correlational analyses were further discussed. These results suggest that English as a foreign language might represent a challenge for students with dyslexia but a strength for bilingual language-minority children.

Children in the intervention group participated in a 4-week programme in which they were taught to correct mispronunciations of spoken words as well as being taught the meanings of those words. Children in the control group received no additional teaching. The intervention group made significant gains in their ability to correct mispronunciations and to read and define the taught words; these gains also generalised to a comparable set of untaught control words. Children can be taught to correct errors in the pronunciation of irregular words, and this may produce generalised effects on learning to read."

German children do not formally learn letter-sounds before school entry. In this study, we evaluated kindergarten children's sensitivity to the frequency of letters and visually similar symbols in child-directed texts, how it develops and whether it predicts early reading abilities.

Method
In a longitudinal study from kindergarten to primary school, children were asked to judge whether a presented alphabetic (e.g., A) or non-alphabetic symbol (e.g., #) was a letter. High and low frequency was varied for both types of symbols. Furthermore, we analysed whether later reading abilities were predicted by this letter judgement ability.

Results
Before school entry, children had difficulties in distinguishing frequent non-alphabetic symbols from letters. Furthermore, letter judgement in kindergarten predicted reading abilities in first grade.

Conclusions
Children derive some knowledge about letters from the frequency of co-occurrence of letters and symbols in texts. The ability to distinguish letters from non-alphabetic symbols predicts early reading."

The results demonstrated early deficits in morphological awareness, besides deficits in phonological awareness, in RD children as compared with typically developing controls, as well as in word and pseudoword spelling and reading (voweled and unvoweled). While phonological awareness emerged as the strongest predictor of reading, morphological awareness was also found to predict unique variance in reading, and even more so in spelling, beyond phonological awareness and cognitive skills. The results demonstrate the early emergence of morphological awareness deficits, alongside phonological deficits in Arabic RD, as well as the role of morphological processing in early reading and spelling.

The present issue aims to bring together observations on reading disabilities across languages and writing systems within cross-linguistic and cross-writing system perspectives while taking into account a broad multidisciplinary scope. An attempt is made to advance theoretical models of developmental dyslexia through systematic analyses of reading disabilities in Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, German, Greek, and Spanish in perspective of universal and particular underlying cognitive principles. It is also discussed how within- and cross-language observations may affect the conceptualization of developmental dyslexia."

In this chapter five neuropsychological conditions that can potentially be linguistically dissociated in bilinguals will be examined: aphasia, alexia, dysphasia, dyslexia, and dementia. In bilingual individuals, aphasia is usually observed in both languages, although the specific aphasia clinical manifestations can be different. The aphasia profile (i.e., type of aphasia) and severity, as well as the pattern of recovery, are not necessarily coincidental in L1 and L2. Alexia can be dissociated across different writing systems, across two phonological systems; and even within the same Latin writing system. In children presenting a specific language acquisition impairment the defect will affect any language the child is exposed to. However, bilingual children are rarely equivalently exposed to each language. Developmental dyslexia can have specific manifestations in each of the languages in bilingual children. These differences are related to the characteristics of the orthographic system, particularly, its transparency or opacity. It is assumed that in bilingual individuals, regression to a primary language may be associated with the development of cognitive impairment and increased risk for the development of dementia."

A hierarchical linear growth modeling was conducted and differences on growth rate were found in vocabulary in kindergarten (p < .001; variance explained = 77.0%), phonemic awareness in kindergarten (p < .001; variance explained = 43.7%) and first grade (p < .01; variance explained = 15.2%), and finally we also find significant growth differences for second grade in oral reading fluency (p < .05; variance explained = 15.1%) and retell task (p < .05; variance explained = 14.5%). Children at risk for reading disabilities in Spanish can improve their skills when they receive explicit instruction in the context of Response to Intervention (RtI). Findings are discussed for each skill in the context of implementing a Tier 2 small group intervention within an RtI approach. Implications for practice in the Spanish educational context are also discussed for children who are struggling with reading."

Neuroimaging studies have shown that the print-speech co-activation in perisylvian networks for print-speech conversion is a universal neural signature of skilled readers. In addition to large commonality, small language differences are suggested: phonological knowledge from spoken language is useful for orthographic learning in transparent writing systems whereas visuospatial processing is more demanded for opaque writing systems, like Chinese. An emerging research suggests that reading acquisition may also reflect a general statistical learning (SL) capacity to implicitly assimilate the systematic structures of a linguistic environment. It is unclear whether visual and auditory SL play similar roles in learning to read different writing systems and whether the experience of learning of any given orthographic system changes the way one detects and computes statistical patterns. To understand the bidirectional relations between SL and reading experience, future research could examine the relative contribution of visual and auditory SL to individual differences in learning different writing systems, e.g., English vs. Chinese and track the changes of SL after learning different writing systems. Such studies will also shed light on the debate in universal account of learning difficulty in dyslexia."

One hundred forty-two Japanese-speaking children were assessed on word reading fluency twice in Grade 1 (Times 1 and 2) and twice in Grade 2 (Times 3 and 4). Nonverbal IQ, vocabulary, phonological awareness, morphological awareness, and rapid automatized naming were also assessed in Time 1. Results of path analysis revealed that Time 1 Hiragana fluency predicted Time 2 Kanji fluency after controlling for the cognitive skills. Time 2 Hiragana fluency did not predict Time 3 Kanji fluency or vice versa after the autoregressor was controlled, but Hiragana and Kanji fluency were reciprocally related between Times 3 and 4. These findings provide evidence for a cross-script transfer of word reading fluency across the two contrastive orthographic systems, and the first evidence of fluency in a morphographic script predicting fluency development in a phonetic script within the same language."

We investigated mean-level and rank-order changes in two reading (word decoding speed and reading comprehension) and two spelling (word and pseudoword spelling accuracy) tasks during a 4-year period from beginning to the later grades of elementary school, and examined whether rank-order changes in literacy skills could be predicted from verbal working memory, phonological awareness, and morpho-syntactic awareness. The sample consisted of Croatian speaking children, poor (n = 50) and good (n = 61) readers. Croatian is a language with a highly transparent orthography but a rather complex grammar. Word decoding speed and word spelling accuracy improved significantly over the study period, word decoding speed more so among good than among poor readers, supporting the Matthew effect hypothesis. Literacy skills were moderately stable, with the highest stability coefficients obtained for word decoding speed, and the lowest for pseudoword spelling. The predictors of rank-order changes varied across literacy outcomes, but did not differ for poor and good readers. Morpho-syntactic awareness predicted rank-order development of all outcomes except for word spelling. Phonological awareness predicted rank-order development of reading comprehension and word spelling. Verbal working memory predicted rank-order development of word spelling only, and at a low level. The finding that the more language related cognitive variables, i.e., morpho-syntactic and phonological skills, were stronger predictors of literacy development than working memory, for both poor and good readers, suggests remedial focus on these more predictive variables."

The process of acquiring word-level reading skills is then described, including learning the alphabetic code, early decoding, and the development of word reading. In turn, processes associated with reading comprehension are discussed in regard to lower order skills, higher order skills, and construction–integration models. The chapter then considers the early development of reading-related skills and discusses the behavior genetics of these skills and emergent literacy and its development. Issues related to the nature and identification of reading difficulties and disorders are discussed, and, finally, different approaches to reading instruction and the evidence in support of these approaches, with a focus on early instruction, are described.

With the introduction and development of cochlear implant intervention, the reading skills of these children have improved substantially although there is a high amount of variability within the group. Orthographic learning is the process of memorizing written words so that they can be recognized instantly and thereby allow for quick and fluent reading. This study set out to explore the cognitive and linguistic predictors of orthographic learning and reading fluency in a group of 40 deaf and hard of hearing children with cochlear implants, to better understand the factors that affect the development of fluent reading in these children. To date, the research about the mechanisms of reading fluency and orthographic learning in this population is scarce. The children were between 6;0 and 10;11 years of age and used oral language as their primary mode of communication. They were assessed on orthographic learning, reading fluency and a range of cognitive and linguistic skills including working memory measures, word retrieval and paired associate learning. The results were analyzed in a set of correlation analyses and hierarchical regression analyses. In line with previous findings from children with typical hearing, the strongest predictors of orthographic learning were phonological decoding fluency and verbal-verbal paired-associate learning. Phonological decoding fluency was the only significant predictor of word decoding fluency when age and non-verbal intelligence were controlled. The significant predictors of phonological decoding fluency were word retrieval, orthographic skills and visual working memory. The results of this study suggest that orthographic learning and reading fluency in children with CI are strongly dependent on similar cognitive and linguistic skills as in typically hearing peers. Efforts should thus be made to support phonological decoding skill and vocabulary in this population."

NA NA NA Methods NA In three passive-listening event-related brain potential (ERP) studies, we examined prosodic processing in literacy-impaired children for various prosodic units by contrasting the processing of word-level and phrase-level prosody, alongside segmental phonology. We retrospectively analysed school children’s ERPs at preschool age for discrimination of vowel length (phoneme processing), discrimination of stress pattern (word-level prosody), and processing of prosodic boundaries (phrase-level prosody). NA NA NA Results NA We found differences between pre-schoolers with and without later literacy difficulties for phoneme and stress pattern discrimination, but not for prosodic boundary perception. NA NA NA Conclusion NA Our findings complement the picture of phonological processing in dyslexia by confirming difficulties in segmental phonology and showing that prosodic processing is affected for the smaller word level, but not the larger phrase level.

Even if children's reading skills seem to be related to their socioeconomic status, only a few studies have examined how SES is related to the development of reading skills in children facing severe poverty. This study traced 322 Roma children facing severe poverty from 7 through 9 years and compared them with an unselected sample of 178 Romanian non-Roma children. The Roma children had both poorer initial reading and a slower growth of their reading skills. In contrast to previous studies, SES did explain growth in reading skills after controlling for other well-known cognitive and linguistic predictors of reading. Among the Roma children, the effects of SES on reading growth were partly mediated by school absence. Thus, interventions directed at Roma children facing severe poverty need to target both the quality of reading instruction and broader aspects of these children's lives."

Here, we characterise word decoding in bilinguals whose two languages differ in orthographic consistency, assessing whether they maintain two distinct reading styles or settle on a single ‘compromise’ reading style. In Experiment 1, Welsh-English bilinguals read cognates and pseudowords embedded in Welsh and English sentences. Eye-movements revealed that bilinguals dynamically alter their decoding strategy according to the language context, including more fixations during lexical access for cognates in the more consistent orthography (Welsh) than in the less consistent orthography (English), and these effects were specific to word (as opposed to pseudoword) processing. In Experiment 2, we compared the same bilinguals’ eye movements in the English sentence reading context to those of monolinguals’. Bilinguals’ eye-movement behaviour was very similar to monolinguals’ when reading English, suggesting that their knowledge of the more consistent orthography (Welsh) did not alter their decoding style when reading in English. This study presents the first characterisation of bilingual decoding style in sentence reading. We discuss our findings in relation to connectionist reading models and models of bilingual visual word recognition."
1,2973167322,the role of executive functions and transcription skills in writing a cross sectional study across 7 years of schooling,2019,"nayme salas, sara silvente",reading and writing,1,0,69,"Findings around the cognitive resources needed to compose text have helped shape current models of writing. Some of these models predict that text generation is constrained by two groups of skills: transcription (i.e., spelling and handwriting) and executive functions (EFs). While the constraining role of transcription on text generation is robust, the relationship between writing and EFs is more scarce. Some studies suggest that the impact of EFs on writing development is not only direct, but also indirect, through transcription skills. However, few studies have analyzed these effects over a sufficiently wide developmental period. In this paper, we examined transcription and EF skills in a large sample of beginner (G2), intermediate (G4), and upper-intermediate (G8) children (N = 1337). Each participant produced a narrative and an opinion essay. In addition, we collected measures of the low-level EFs of inhibition and updating of working memory, as well as measures of handwriting fluency and spelling accuracy. Results showed that EFs impacted text generation directly and indirectly via transcription skills, especially via handwriting. Transcription skills constrained text generation across grade levels and its weight was similar from the youngest through to the oldest age group. We conclude that EFs support low-level writing skills, as well as key processes involved in children’s text composing (i.e., knowledge-telling processes). Relevant educational implications are discussed."
1,2974301415,morphological processing influences on dyslexia in greek speaking children,2019,"kyriakoula m rothou, susana padeliadu",annals of dyslexia,1,0,53,"The study explored the inflectional morphological awareness of Greek-speaking children with dyslexia in grade 3. The sample consisted of 24 dyslexic children and 32 chronological age-matched typically developing readers. All participants completed two oral experimental tasks of inflectional morphological awareness (i.e., verb inflections and noun-adjective inflections). The noun-adjective inflection task assessed children’s ability to produce the plural of articles, adjectives, and nouns in the context of a sentence. The verb inflection task required children to change the tense of the verb in a sentence. Furthermore, phonological awareness and oral receptive vocabulary were assessed. Greek-speaking children with dyslexia faced difficulties in both inflectional tasks and in receptive vocabulary. They appeared to have greater difficulty in elicitation of non-past tense from past tense. Binary logistic regression targeted at understanding whether dyslexia can be predicted based on phonological and non-phonological oral language skills revealed that phonological awareness had a significant effect on distinguishing dyslexics from typically developing readers. Overall, our findings lead us to suggest that in an alphabetic language with a shallow orthographic system and rich morphology, children with dyslexia appear to have impaired inflectional morphological awareness and impaired vocabulary in comparison to their peers. Moreover, these results suggest the significance of teaching morphological skills in improving reading skills. However, further research is needed to substantiate these findings."

Word and pseudoword reading accuracy and fluency were assessed at the start and end of grade 5 and at the end of grade 6. Phonological awareness, rapid naming, verbal short-term memory, vocabulary, and visual attention span were assessed at the start of grade 5. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that children with dyslexia were less accurate than typical readers and showed very little improvements in accuracy over time. They were also less fluent and showed less growth in reading fluency than typical readers. The children with dyslexia did improve more in word reading fluency than in pseudoword reading fluency over time. Visual attention span and phonological awareness predicted reading accuracy development in typical readers, while rapid naming predicted individual differences in reading fluency in children with dyslexia. It can be concluded that in the upper grades, children with dyslexia not only struggled with fluent reading, but they also still struggled with accurate reading in a relatively transparent orthography like Dutch, even after they had received a reading intervention to remediate their reading difficulties."

En este articulo les informamos sobre dos estudios que comparan el desarrollo de las habilidades de alfabetizacion del ingles y del frances de estudiantes inmersos en frances cuyo idioma materno es el ingles (EL1) y de unos aprendices del ingles (EL2). En el primer estudio, 81 EL1s y 147 ELs fueron examinados en el otono y la primavera de su primer grado. Los EL1 y los ELs mostraron resultados similares y mejoramientos comparables en cuanto a su conciencia fonologica y la lectura de palabras en ingles. Se observaron resultados comparables para todas las medidas en Frances (conciencia fonologica, vocabulario receptivo, lectura de palabra y comprension lectora). Los EL1 sobrepasaron a los ELs unicamente en cuanto al vocabulario receptivo en ingles. En el segundo estudio se le dio seguimiento a un subgrupo de estudiantes del primer estudio en el segundo y tercer grado (36 EL1 y 33 ELs). En su totalidad, los EL1 y los ELs mostraron resultados y mejoramientos similares en su conciencia fonologica del ingles, la lectura de palabras y la comprension lectora en el segundo y el tercer grado. Los EL1 sobrepasaron a sus companeros EL en cuanto al vocabulario expresivo y receptivo en todos los grados, a pesar de un crecimiento mas rapido en los ELs. Al mismo tiempo, los resultados de todas las medidas en frances eran comparables al de ambos grupos. Encontrar que los resutados son sorprendentemente comparables entre los EL1 y los ELs sugiere que, en total, la inmersion en frances no impide el desarrollo del lenguaje y la alfabetizacion del ingles en ELs, de forma que es una opcion viable para estos estudiantes.

Dans la premiere recherche, nous avons teste 81 AL1 et 147 AL2 de premiere annee a l'automne et au printemps. Les AL1 et les AL2 ont obtenu des resultats semblables et des progres comparables en conscience phonologique de l'anglais et en lecture de mots. Nous avons observe des resultats comparables dans toutes les evaluations en francais (conscience phonologique, connaissance du vocabulaire en reception, lecture des mots, et comprehension de la lecture). Ce n'est qu'en reception du vocabulaire que les AL1 ont fait mieux que les AL2. Dans la seconde recherche, nous avons suivi un sous-ensemble des eleves de la premiere etude en 2e et 3e annee (36 AL1 et 33 AL2). De facon generale, les AL1 et AL2 ont obtenu des resultats et realise des progres semblables en 2e et 3e annee. Les AL1 ont depasse leurs pairs d'AL2 en expression et reception du vocabulaire. Au meme moment, les resultats de toutes les evaluations en francais ont ete comparables pour les deux groupes. Le fait que les resultats des AL1 et AL2 soient remarquablement comparables suggere que, dans l'ensemble, l'immersion en francais ne gene pas le developpement de l'anglais et le developpement des competences en AL2, faisant de celle-ci une option valable pour ces eleves."

In dieser Studie wurde die Entwicklung von Leseflussigkeit und Rechtschreibleistung in den ersten vier Jahrgangsstufen von n = 351 immersiv und n = 306 konventionell unterrichteten Schulern verglichen. Latente Wachstumskurvenmodelle zeigten, dass die Schulergruppen in beiden Domanen dasselbe Ausgangsniveau aufwiesen. In der Leseflussigkeit fand sich jedoch ein schnellerer Leistungszuwachs bei den immersiv unterrichteten Schulern, wahrend sich die Rechtschreibleistung in beiden Gruppen ahnlich positiv entwickelte. Damit bestatigt sich, dass Immersionsschuler trotz Unterrichts in einer Fremdsprache mindestens keine Nachteile im L1-Lesen und Schreiben erleiden.

1,1985542984,cross language transfer in english immersion programs in germany reading comprehension and reading fluency,2013,"sandra kristina gebauer, anna c m zaunbauer, jens moller",contemporary educational psychology,1,34,94,"Abstract NA NA Cross-language effects on reading skills are of particular interest in the context of foreign language immersion programs. Although there is an extensive literature on cross-language effects on reading in general, research focusing on immersion students and including different dimensions of reading acquisition such as reading fluency and reading comprehension is scarce. This study therefore investigated cross-language transfer between first-language (L1) and second-language (L2) reading fluency and reading comprehension in a group of 220 German elementary school students who were enrolled in English partial immersion programs. Students were tested in grades 3 and 4. Structural equation modeling was used to examine cross-language transfer in a cross-lagged panel design. Results showed moderate cross-language paths when controlling for autoregressive effects. These findings are in line with previous results showing reciprocal transfer effects between L1 and L2 reading comprehension and reading fluency. In addition, the overall dominance of paths from L2 to L1 over paths from L1 to L2 suggests immersion-specific relations that may be attributable to the plentiful opportunities for academic reading in the L2 at school. Hence, skills necessary for successful reading can evidently be acquired in an L2 context and transferred to the L1. These findings underline the importance of cross-language transfer between reading skills in immersion programs."

Children in French Immersion programs in Grade 3 were asked to name aloud cognates, interlingual homographs, interlingual homophones, and matched control words. Half of the participants performed the task in English, their first oral language, and half performed the task in French. Control monolingual children in each language were also tested. In the French reading task, fewer errors were observed for cognates and interlingual homophones than for matched control words, whereas more errors were produced for interlingual homographs than matched controls. Only the inhibitory interlingual homograph effect was observed in the English reading task. These data provide evidence that phonological activation in bilinguals is not language selective. The locus of each of these effects in the bilingual word recognition system is discussed."

Measures of linguistic proficiency (vocabulary and grammatical knowledge) were consistently higher in English and remained so even after 5 years of immersion education in French. Measures of metalinguistic ability (letter fluency and ignoring semantic anomalies in sentence judgments) in French improved significantly over the two grades studied and closed the gap (letter fluency) or caught up with (sentence judgments) similar performance in English. This dissociation between developmental trajectories for linguistic and metalinguistic development is exactly the pattern expected for fully bilingual children, endorsing immersion education as a route to bilingualism."
1,2030066779,the predictive effects of l1 and l2 early literacy indicators on reading in french immersion,2014,renee bourgoin,canadian modern language review revue canadienne des langues vivantes,1,12,43,"Abstract: This study explored the predictive effects of within- and cross-language early literacy indicators with regard to second language (L2) reading achievement in a Grade 3 entry-point French immersion (FI) program. Kindergarten students (N = 83) in a regular English program were administered English early literacy measures. Three years later, once students entered the FI, 56 students from the original cohort were reassessed using French literacy measures. This allowed for an examination of the long-term connections between first language (L1) early literacy indicators and L2 reading outcomes. Regression analysis revealed that L1 early literacy skills relating to aspects of phonological awareness and, more importantly, alphabetic knowledge were significant predictors of L2 reading even when school-based L2 learning was delayed several years. With respect to the French literacy indicators, knowledge of the alphabet and related measures were again significant predictors of L2 reading performance. The p..."
1,2033026320,continuity and change in the home literacy environment as predictors of growth in vocabulary and reading,2014,"monique senechal, joanne lefevre",child development,1,79,44,"One hundred and ten English-speaking children schooled in French were followed from kindergarten to Grade 2 (Mage :T 1= 5;6, T2 = 6;4, T3 = 6;11, T4 = 7;11). The findings provided strong support for the Home Literacy Model (Senechal & LeFevre, 2002) because in this sample the home language was independent of the language of instruction. The informal literacy environment at home predicted growth in English receptive vocabulary from kindergarten to Grade 1, whereas parent reports of the formal literacy environment in kindergarten predicted growth in children’s English early literacy between kindergarten and Grade 1 and growth in English word reading during Grade 1. Furthermore, 76% of parents adjusted their formal literacy practices according to the reading performance of their child, in support of the presence of a responsive home literacy curriculum among middle-class parents. Young children enter Grade 1 with a variety of skills that facilitate their acquisition of reading. Individual differences in the quality of these skills are present early and remain relatively stable over time (e.g., Butler, Marsh, Sheppard, & Sheppard, 1985). Children who struggle with learning to read in Grade 1 often have difficulty in other school domains, and are less likely than their peers to complete high school or pursue education beyond high school (Alexander, Entwisle, & Horsey, 1997; Entwisle, Alexander, & Olson, 2005). Given the stability of the pathways toward efficient reading and academic success, it is essential to understand the development of these differences so that intervention can be done early (Hart & Petrill, 2009; Landry, Smith, Swank, & Guttentag, 2008). In this research, we examined the role of the home literacy environment in prediction of language and literacy development for young English-speaking children as they entered kindergarten, learned to read in Grade 1, and became more fluent readers in Grade 2. The novelty of this research is that the children were schooled in French but spoke English at home, thus allowing for a test of the relation between English home literacy activities and the children’s progress in English literacy that was independent of schoolbased English language instruction."

ANCOVA results revealed that the French immersion children outperformed the other two groups on measures of English phonological awareness and word reading and that the bilingual groups were comparable to monolingual English norms on a test of receptive vocabulary. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine cross-language transfer of skills. French morphological awareness explained unique variance in English word reading and vocabulary for the French immersion group. For the other two groups, Chinese phonological awareness was significantly related to English word reading. Our results suggest that instruction in French or Chinese does not delay the development of early English language and literacy skills for Chinese-speaking children, as the children may be able to leverage skills from their other language to facilitate their English learning."

Children in French immersion programs were asked to play a dictionary game when they were in Grade 2 and again when they were in Grade 3. They were shown pseudowords that contained either an English spelling pattern or a French spelling pattern, and they were asked to decide whether each pseudoword should go in an English dictionary or a French dictionary if it became a real word. Comparison groups of monolingual English children, monolingual French children, and English–French bilingual university students were also tested on the task. French immersion students in both grades were above chance in discriminating between the two types of pseudowords but were well below adult performance on the task. Measures obtained in kindergarten showed that early print knowledge had some ability to predict later ability to discriminate between the orthographic patterns of the two languages. Further analyses indicated that exposure to print in each language in Grades 1 to 3 was strongly related to discrimination performance. The findings are interpreted as being consistent with the statistical learning hypothesis."
1,2094776303,the moderating effect of orthographic consistency on oral vocabulary learning in monolingual and bilingual children,2014,"kathleen jubenville, monique senechal, melissa malette",journal of experimental child psychology,1,10,28,"Abstract NA NA Two studies were conducted to assess whether (a) the incidental presence of print facilitates the acquisition of oral vocabulary, (b) the facilitative effect of print is moderated by phoneme-to-grapheme consistency, and (c) the findings obtained with monolingual children generalize to bilingual children. In total, 71 monolingual French-speaking children (Mage = 9 years 2 months) in Study 1 and 64 bilingual children (Mage = 9 years 3 months) in Study 2 participated in one of three conditions: consistent print, inconsistent print, or no print. Children were to learn novel labels for unfamiliar objects in a paired-associate paradigm. In both studies, print facilitated the acquisition and recall of expressive vocabulary. The effect of print consistency, however, varied across studies. As expected, monolingual children exposed to consistent print learned more novel labels than children exposed to inconsistent print. In contrast, bilingual children exposed to inconsistent print learned and recalled more labels than children exposed to consistent print. These intriguing findings might be due to differences in attention allocation during training."

Since then, questions have been raised regarding the suitability of French immersion for students with academic and learning difficulties. Research examining the suitability of French immersion for a wide range of learners is highlighted in this article, in order to make links between research and the inclusionary practices that are currently being promoted in French immersion programs. An analysis of the extent to which different Canadian jurisdictions address key concepts related to inclusion in French immersion, including accessibility and retention, is then presented. Current gaps in the ways in which inclusionary practices in French immersion are supported are described in the final sections of this article, with the hope of advancing the promotion of early French immersion as a fully inclusionary program option."

Closely matched phoneme and onset-rime awareness tasks were administered in English and French in the spring of kindergarten to English-dominant children in French immersion programmes (n 598). Regression analyses indicated that English phoneme manipulation was a significant predictor of both English and French reading outcomes after controlling for kindergarten knowledge of letter names and word identification. French onset-rime knowledge measured in kindergarten accounted for significant variance for French reading outcome measures. Results support the existence of a link between English phoneme manipulation in kindergarten and both English and French reading outcomes in Grade 2. Practically, these results provide information about what phonological awareness measures can be used in kindergarten to predict later reading outcomes for children learning to read in an L2."

This paper explores the literature on biliteracy development with a focus on Spanish/English bilingual students in the early elementary grades. Several classroom activities are then presented that have been found by educational researchers to be effective in fostering biliteracy development in emergent bilinguals and that can be implemented in any classroom by bilingual or monolingual teachers. The potential for such activities to foster positive biliterate identities and expand bilingual students’ future options are discussed."

L1 and L2 competencies were assessed at four time points (pretest and three posttests). No detrimental effects of immersion on L1 development were found. Concerning L2 receptive skills, the immersion group outperformed the conventional instruction group in each posttest. Contact quality and quantity were found to relate to L2 acquisition through immersion. Immersion appears to be a successful method for early L2 learning; it fosters L2 receptive skills without any cost for the L1."

Participants were assessed with the same tasks twice with a 1-year interval from Grade 3 to Grade 4 in phonological and morphological awareness and derived word decoding in both English and Malay. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that both types of metalinguistic awareness significantly predicted derived word reading in both languages. Subsequent cross-lagged panel modeling found construct-level transfer facilitation effect from Malay on English for phonological awareness but conversely from English on Malay for morphological awareness. Neither type of metalinguistic awareness exerted a transfer facilitation effect on word reading. These findings shed light on the developmental mechanism of cross-linguistic transfer in biliteracy acquisition.

The present longitudinal study examined minority and majority language children at the end of Grades 3 and 4, who attended a German-English partial immersion primary school, with respect to their English and German reading comprehension and fluency skills. The results did not reveal any differences between the two groups irrespective of the test format and the language being tested.

A group of 66 students were tested on measures of phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, word reading accuracy, vocabulary, word reading fluency and reading comprehension in English and French at both time points. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine whether vocabulary and word reading fluency interact in predicting English and French reading comprehension. Regressions were constructed for each language and grade separately. Results showed that in Grade 2, word reading fluency and vocabulary contributed independently to reading comprehension, though an interaction between these variables was not observed in either language. By Grade 3, an interaction between these constructs emerged and was shown to predict reading comprehension in both English and French. Specifically, vocabulary was positively related to reading comprehension among students with moderate to high levels of fluency, while vocabulary did not uniquely contribute to reading comprehension among those who were less fluent. The emergence of an interaction in Grade 3 suggests that as students’ reading skills become more proficient, reading comprehension outcomes are better explained by taking into account the interaction between reading fluency and vocabulary knowledge."

It remains unclear whether students have better reading comprehension in their L1 (native language hypothesis) and/or whether all students, irrespective of their L1, have better reading comprehension in the majority than in the minority language (majority language hypothesis). In this study of all fourth-grade two-way immersion classes in Berlin (N = 939 students), reading tests from a large-scale international student achievement study were administered in German and nine partner languages. The results of multivariate regression analyses supported the native language hypothesis, with L1 speakers outperforming L2 speakers on the interindividual level for both languages. The data also confirmed the majority language hypothesis: two-way immersion students, irrespective of their L1, scored significantly higher in German than in the partner language on the intraindividual level."
1,2975746104,assessing reading in second language learners development validity and educational considerations,2019,"esther geva, yueming xi, angela masseygarrison, joyce y mak",NA,0,1,169,"The overall objective of this chapter is to provide educational professionals with an overview of theory and research findings about the field of second language (L2) reading development in typically developing learners and those with reading difficulties. We also intend to inform readers of the implications of this research for the development of culturally and linguistically sensitive, reliable, and valid strategies for the assessment of L2 learners who may have a reading difficulty. For both monolinguals and L2 learners, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, and working memory are significant early predictors of reading comprehension and reading fluency later on. L2 learners in early grades can develop word reading skills at a level that approximates their monolingual peers even when their oral language proficiency is still developing. Oral language proficiency becomes the most prominent predictor of reading comprehension and reading fluency around fourth grade when the text becomes more cognitively demanding. Therefore, early cognitive skills measured in the first language can be used reliably to merit a diagnosis of reading disability in the L2. When word reading and text reading of L2 learners is persistently dysfluent in comparison with other students with similar linguistic and educational backgrounds, the reading difficulties cannot be attributed to their L2 status and may reflect underlying cognitive deficits."
1,2976000166,cognate facilitation in frisian dutch bilingual children s sentence reading an eye tracking study,2020,"evelyn bosma, naomi nota",journal of experimental child psychology,1,0,57,"Abstract NA NA Bilingual adults are faster in reading cognates than in reading non-cognates in both their first language (L1) and second language (L2). This cognate effect has been shown to be gradual: recognition was facilitated when words had higher degrees of cross-linguistic similarity. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether cognate facilitation can also be observed in bilingual children’s sentence reading. To answer this question, a group of Frisian–Dutch bilingual children (N = 37) aged 9–12 years completed a reading task in both their languages. All children had Dutch as their dominant reading language, but most of them spoke mainly Frisian at home. Identical cognates (e.g., Dutch–Frisian boek–boek ‘book’), non-identical cognates (e.g., beam–boom ‘tree’), and non-cognates (e.g., beppe–oma ‘grandmother’) were presented in sentence context, and eye movements were recorded. The results showed a non-gradual cognate facilitation effect in Frisian: identical cognates were read faster than non-identical cognates and non-cognates. In Dutch, no cognate facilitation effect could be observed. This suggests that bilingual children use their dominant reading language while reading in their non-dominant one, but not vice versa."

of intervention programmes, evidence from rigorous trials for the effectiveness of
interventions that promote oral language abilities in the early years is sparse. 

Aims: This study evaluates the effectiveness of a language intervention programme for
children identified as having poor oral language skills in preschool classes. 

Methods & Procedures: A randomised controlled trial was carried out in 13 UK nursery
schools. In each nursery, eight children (N = 104, mean age = 3 years 11 months) with the
poorest performance on standardised language measures were selected to take part. All but
one child was randomly allocated to either an intervention (N = 52) or a waiting control
group (N = 51). The intervention group received a 15-week oral language programme in
addition to their standard nursery curriculum. The programme was delivered by trained
teaching assistants and aimed to foster vocabulary knowledge, narrative and listening skills. 

Outcomes & Results: Initial results revealed significant differences between the intervention
and control group on measures of taught vocabulary. No group differences were found on
any standardised language measure; however there were gains of moderate effect size in
listening comprehension. 

Conclusions & Implications: The study suggests that an intervention, of moderate duration
and intensity, for small groups of preschool children successfully builds vocabulary
knowledge, but does not generalize to non-taught areas of language. The findings strike a
note of caution about implementing language interventions of moderate duration in
preschool settings. The findings also highlight the importance of including a control group in
intervention studies."

Methods: Within a large, 5-year longitudinal study, children progressing from prekindergarten to second grade were administered a comprehensive set of prekindergarten measures of foundational language skills (vocabulary and grammar), higher-level language skills (inferencing, comprehension monitoring, and text structure knowledge), listening comprehension, working memory, and nonverbal processing, as well as second grade measures of listening comprehension. Results: A prekindergarten measure of listening comprehension—the Test of Narrative Language—and a prekindergarten measure of foundational language skills and working memory—the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-4 Recalling Sentences—were significant predictors of second grade listening comprehension. Conclusions: Our findings show that a quick, reliable measure of sentence imitation and/or listening comprehension, administered in prekindergarten, provides insight into a child's second grade listening comprehension. Knowing who is at risk for comprehension failure will allow educators to make informed, evidence-based decisions on the need for further in-depth assessment and language-intensive instruction to stave off future reading disabilities."

The present study examined the learning and consolidation of sequential knowledge in 30 adults with dyslexia and 29 typical adults matched on age and nonverbal ability using two tasks previously reported to be sensitive to a sequence learning deficit. Both groups showed evidence of sequential learning and consolidation on a serial response time (SRT) task (i.e., faster and more accurate responses to sequenced spatial locations than randomly ordered spatial locations during training that persisted one week later). Whilst typical adults showed evidence of sequential learning on a Hebb repetition task (i.e., more accurate serial recall of repetitive sequences of nonwords versus randomly ordered sequences), adults with dyslexia showed initial advantages for repetitive versus randomly ordered sequences in the first half of training trials, but this effect disappeared in the second half of trials. This Hebb repetition effect was positively correlated with spelling in the dyslexic group; however, there was no correlation between sequential learning on the two tasks, placing doubt over whether sequential learning in different modalities represents a single capacity. These data suggest that sequential learning difficulties in adults with dyslexia are not ubiquitous, and when present may be a consequence of task demands rather than sequence learning per se."

Oral language skills are a critical foundation for literacy and more generally for educational success. The current study shows that oral language skills can be improved by providing suitable additional help to children with language difficulties in the early stages of formal education.

Methods
We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 394 children in England, comparing a 30-week oral language intervention programme starting in nursery (N = 132) with a 20-week version of the same programme starting in Reception (N = 133). The intervention groups were compared to an untreated waiting control group (N = 129). The programmes were delivered by trained teaching assistants (TAs) working in the children's schools/nurseries. All testers were blind to group allocation.

Results
Both the 20- and 30-week programmes produced improvements on primary outcome measures of oral language skill compared to the untreated control group. Effect sizes were small to moderate (20-week programme: d = .21; 30-week programme: d = .30) immediately following the intervention and were maintained at follow-up 6 months later. The difference in improvement between the 20-week and 30-week programmes was not statistically significant. Neither programme produced statistically significant improvements in children's early word reading or reading comprehension skills (secondary outcome measures).

Conclusions
This study provides further evidence that oral language interventions can be delivered successfully by trained TAs to children with oral language difficulties in nursery and Reception classes. The methods evaluated have potentially important policy implications for early education."

We investigate sentence repetition in 5- to 8-year-old native speakers of Kannada, an inflectionally rich language of India. The inflectional characteristics of the language make it an ideal testing ground for exploring the engagement of grammatical and phonological encoding processes. We presented active, passive, and embedded sentences and, in a subset of the material, we also manipulated sentence length. Using accuracy and speech error analyses at the sentence, word, and affix levels, we provide evidence that individual differences in task performance are influenced by the linguistic properties of the material. These findings clarify the role of key language production mechanisms involved in sentence repetition. We propose that it is the versatility to develop a profile across several language production mechanisms that makes sentence repetition particularly useful as a clinical tool."

An intronic deletion within the DCDC2 gene, with ~8% frequency in European populations, is increasingly used as a marker for dyslexia in neuroimaging and behavioral studies. At a mechanistic level, this deletion has been proposed to influence sensory processing capacity, and in particular sensitivity to visual coherent motion. Our re-assessment of the literature, however, did not reveal strong support for a role of this specific deletion in dyslexia. We also analyzed data from five distinct cohorts, enriched for individuals with dyslexia, and did not identify any signal indicative of associations for the DCDC2 deletion with reading-related measures, including in a combined sample analysis (N=526). We believe we conducted the first replication analysis for a proposed deletion effect on visual motion perception and found no association (N=445 siblings). We also report that the DCDC2 deletion has a frequency of 37.6% in a cohort representative of the general population recruited in Hong Kong (N=220). This figure, together with a lack of association between the deletion and reading abilities in this cohort, indicates the low likelihood of a direct deletion effect on reading skills. Therefore, on the basis of multiple strands of evidence, we conclude that the DCDC2 deletion is not a strong risk factor for dyslexia. Our analyses and literature re-evaluation are important for interpreting current developments within multidisciplinary studies of dyslexia and, more generally, contribute to current discussions about the importance of reproducibility in science."

It is widely believed that increasing parental involvement can improve children's educational outcomes although we lack good evidence for such claims. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a parent-delivered early language enrichment programme.

Methods
We conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 208 preschool children and their parents living in socially diverse areas in the United Kingdom. Families were allocated to an oral language programme (N = 103) or an active control programme targeting motor skills (N = 105). Parents delivered the programmes to their child at home in daily 20-min sessions over 30 weeks of teaching.

Results
Children receiving the language programme made significantly larger gains in language (d = .21) and narrative skills (d = .36) than children receiving the motor skills programme at immediate posttest. Effects on language were maintained 6 months later (d = .34), and at this point, the language group also scored higher on tests of early literacy (d values=.35 and .42). There was no evidence that the movement programme improved motor skills.

Conclusions
This study provides evidence for the effectiveness of a parent-delivered language enrichment programme. Further large-scale evaluations of the programme are needed to confirm and extend these findings."

Language development has been characterised by significant individual stability from school entry. However, the extent to which trajectories of language growth vary in children with language disorder as a function of co-occurring developmental challenges is a question of theoretical import, with implications for service provision.

Methods
SCALES employed a population-based survey design with sample weighting procedures to estimate growth in core language skills over the first three years of school. A stratified sample (n = 529) received comprehensive assessment of language, nonverbal IQ, and social, emotional and behavioural difficulties at 5–6 years of age and 95% of the sample (n = 499) were assessed again at ages 7–8. Language growth was measured using both raw and standard scores in children with typical development, children with language disorder of unknown origin, and children with language disorders associated with a known clinical condition and/or intellectual disability.

Results
Overall, language was stable at the individual level (estimated ICC = 0.95) over the first three years of school. Linear mixed effects models highlighted steady growth in language raw scores across all three groups, including those with multiple developmental challenges. There was little evidence, however, that children with language disorders were narrowing the gap with peers (z-scores). Adjusted models indicated that while nonverbal ability, socioeconomic status and social, emotional and behavioural deficits predicted initial language score (intercept), none predicted language growth (slope).

Conclusions
These findings corroborate previous studies suggesting stable language trajectories after ages 5–6 years, but add considerably to previous work by demonstrating similar developmental patterns in children with additional nonverbal cognitive deficits, social, emotional, and behavioural challenges, social disadvantage or clinical diagnoses."

The sample contained 237 children (164 at family risk for dyslexia) from the Dutch Dyslexia Program. Longitudinal data were obtained on seven occasions when children were between 4 and 12 years old. The relationship between early oral language ability and reading comprehension at the age of 12 years was mediated by preliteracy skills and word-decoding ability for the first pathway and by later language abilities for the second pathway. Family risk influenced literacy development through its subsequent relations with preliteracy skills, word decoding, and reading comprehension. Although performance on language measures was often lower for the family-risk group than for the no-family-risk group, family risk did not have a specific relation with either early or later oral language abilities."

1,2807964889,effectiveness of a small group vocabulary intervention programme evidence from a regression discontinuity design,2018,"hannah dyson, jonathan solity, wendy best, charles hulme",international journal of language & communication disorders,1,2,26,"Background:

Children's vocabulary knowledge is closely related to other measures of language development and to literacy skills and educational attainment.

Aim:

To use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to evaluate the effectiveness of a small‐group vocabulary intervention programme for children with poor vocabulary knowledge.

Methods & Procedures:

The vocabulary knowledge of children (N = 199) aged 6–9 years was assessed in six classes. Based on scores at the initial assessment, children with low vocabulary scores for their age were assigned to an intervention group (43 children), with the remaining 156 children assigned to a control group. Children in the intervention group received two to three small‐group weekly teaching sessions over a 10‐week period. All children were retested post‐intervention on the same measures of vocabulary knowledge.

Outcomes & Results:

The intervention group showed significant improvements in their knowledge of the meanings of the taught words at post‐test (an additional 3.95 words learned [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.70–5.20] compared with the control group; d = 1.20), but the effects did not generalize to untaught words.

Conclusions & Implications:

A small‐group vocabulary intervention programme is effective for teaching word meanings to 6–9‐year‐old children with poor vocabulary skills. This study provides further evidence that the RDD is an effective method for evaluating educational interventions."

Through a series of structural equation models, we examine the relations within a full sample of first grade students at the beginning of the year (N = 290). Next, we conducted analyses to determine if differential relations exist between the variables in students who are identified as at-risk for reading failure, and potentially reading disability (n = 141) and those who are not (n = 149). Results indicate that in early first grade, the relations between the subcomponent skills are different dependent upon risk status. For the full sample, fluency was the strongest predictor of reading comprehension, followed by decoding and listening comprehension. When the sample was split based on early reading skills at the beginning of first grade, for the not at-risk students, fluency, decoding, and listening comprehension each made individual contributions to reading comprehension. For the at-risk students, decoding was only significantly related to reading comprehension via fluency; listening comprehension did not significantly predict reading comprehension for this subsample. The findings are discussed and related to implications for the development and implementation of early reading interventions for students who are identified as having reading difficulties and potentially reading disability."

Monolingual children from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds were assessed longitudinally; at ages 5–6 (2012/2013) and 7–8 years (2014/2015). Persistent weaknesses in SOP characterized children with DLD but did not predict language longitudinally. Ratings of inattention/hyperactivity moderated the association between SOP and language, indicating that SOP deficits are particularly detrimental for language when coupled with poor attention/hyperactivity. SOP may be a shared risk factor for DLD and inattention/hyperactivity or a general marker of neurodevelopmental disorder."

Recently, it has been suggested that the relationship between numerosity discrimination and arithmetic is explained by inhibition rather than the ANS. We assessed this hypothesis in a study of 496 children (mean age = 81.23 months) using numerosity discrimination tasks that manipulated the congruency between surface area and numerosity. Numerosity discrimination for incongruent arrays (which are postulated to require inhibition due to a conflict between judgments based on surface area rather than numerosity) was more difficult than that for congruent arrays. However, all numerosity discrimination tasks showed substantial correlations with each other and correlated with arithmetic. A latent variable path model showed that a general numerosity judgment factor correlated with arithmetic even after controlling for a measure of response inhibition. In contrast, numerosity discrimination for incongruent arrays showed no unique relationship with arithmetic ability. Our results do not support the view that the relationship between numerosity discrimination and arithmetic is largely attributable to inhibition; rather, they are consistent with the view that numerosity discrimination tasks tap the operation of an ANS."

According to the Simple View of Reading, this complexity can be captured as the product of two sets of skills: decoding and linguistic comprehension. The Simple View explains variance in reading comprehension and provides a good framework to guide the classification of reading disorders. This paper discusses how weaknesses in either or both of components of the Simple View are implicated in children’s reading comprehension difficulties. It concludes with reflections on the strengths and limitations of the Simple View as a theoretical and practical framework to guide our understanding of reading comprehension and its development."

Importantly, many theories posit that dyslexia reflects a cascade of impairments emanating from a ""core deficit"". Here we collect a battery of psychophysical and language measures in 106 school-aged children to investigate whether dyslexia is best conceptualized under a core-deficit model, or as a disorder with heterogenous origins. Specifically, by capitalizing on the drift diffusion model to separate sensory encoding from task-related influences on performance in a visual motion discrimination experiment, we show that deficits in motion perception, decision making and phonological processing manifest largely independently. Based on statistical models of how variance in reading skill is parceled across measures of sensory encoding, phonological processing and decision-making, our results challenge the notion that a unifying deficit characterizes dyslexia. Instead, these findings indicate a model where reading skill is explained by several distinct, additive predictors, or risk factors, of reading (dis)ability."

Here we ask whether this would also be the case in a task that does not manipulate linguistic information. Another question of interest is whether executive skills, often found to support learning, may play a larger role in a non‐linguistic audio‐visual associative task compared to a linguistic one. We present a new task that measures learning when having to associate non‐linguistic auditory signals with novel visual shapes. Importantly, our novel task shares with linguistic processes such as reading acquisition the need to associate sounds with arbitrary shapes. Yet, rather than phonemes or syllables, it uses novel environmental sounds – therefore limiting direct reliance on linguistic abilities. Five‐year‐old French‐speaking children (N = 76, 39 girls) were assessed individually in our novel audio‐visual associative task, as well as in a number of other cognitive tasks evaluating linguistic abilities and executive functions. We found phonological awareness and language comprehension to be related to scores in the audio‐visual associative task, while no correlation with executive functions was observed. These results underscore a key relation between foundational language competencies and audio‐visual associative learning, even in the absence of linguistic input in the associative task."

Individuals who perform poorly on phonological assessments have been mostly assumed to have underspecified (or “fuzzy”) phonological representations, with typical phonemic categories, but with greater category overlap due to imprecise encoding. An alternative posits that poor readers have overspecified phonological representations, with speech sounds perceived allophonically (phonetically distinct variants of a single phonemic category). On both accounts, mismatch between phonological categories and orthography leads to reading difficulty. Here, we consider the implications of these accounts for online speech processing. We used eye tracking and an individual differences approach to assess sensitivity to subphonemic detail in a community sample of young adults with a wide range of reading-related skills. Subphonemic sensitivity inversely correlated with meta-phonological task performance, consistent with overspecification."

The causal role of cognitive deficits typically associated to DD can be investigated through intervention studies. It has been demonstrated that visual-attention and reading speed could be simultaneously improved by using action video game (AVG) training both in shallow and deep alphabetic orthographies. Here, in a clinical study we showed that after this general-domain behavioral intervention both the phonological decoding speed and phonological short-term memory were increased only in DD children in which their video game score was improved. These findings confirm that an AVG training enhances the efficiency of both visual and auditory processing. The plasticity of the multi-sensory attentional network could explain the reading and reading-related improvements induced by the AVG training in children with DD."

Classical regression identified decoding, vocabulary, and morphosyntactic knowledge as unique predictors with no interaction with language background. Quantile regression demonstrated that the prediction of reading comprehension differed across ability levels; decoding and morphosyntactic knowledge were consistently unique predictors, but vocabulary was uniquely related only for poor comprehenders and working memory only for good comprehenders.

However, QR models the conditional quantile function of y given x just as linear regression models the conditional mean function. This article's contribution is twofold: First, it discusses potential consequences of methodological misconceptions and formulations of Petscher and Logan's (2014) presentation by contrasting features of QR and linear regression. Second, it reinforces the importance of correct understanding of QR in empirical research by illustrating similarities and differences in various QR estimators and linear regression using simulated data.

It is hoped that this review will serve to highlight some interesting features of this important problem. Some of the investigations discussed are currently being prepared for publication. The overview of the results is reported here simply to provide examples and ramifications of what we consider to be a reasonably heuristic approach to the investigation of this thorny issue. In this discussion, it is taken as demonstrated that some forms of central information processing differences and/or deficits are responsible for the group of clinical disorders known as learning disabilities. There is evidence (Benton 1975; Rourke 1975,1978a, 1978b) that is quite consistent with the view that various types and degrees of disordered brain function are responsible for the information processing deficiencies that character ize at least the majority of children who are learning disabled."

The pattern of strengths and weaknesses shown by Low Nonverbal subjects suggested good left-brain functioning, but a right-brain dysfunction. These subjects were good readers, but relatively weak in arithmetic. Behaviors reported significantly more often for the Low Nonverbal subjects were low motivation, poor work habits, inability to work independently or to take age-related responsibility, disorganization, and poor relationships with peers. High Nonverbal subjects, who exhibited signs of a probable left-brain dysfunction, were usually perceived by their teachers as sociable, responsible, and determined to succeed, in spite of their having language disorders and dyslexia. It is argued that the constellation of behaviors displayed by the Low Nonverbal subjects is part of the right-brain dysfunction syndrome. To date, there are limited resources available for helping such children."

Each of the 66 subjects was rated by two teachers (English and mathematics) on the eight items of the Personal-Social Behavior section of the Myklebust Pupil Rating Scale. Factor analysis showed that the eight behaviors split into two factors: Factor I—responsibility and Factor II—social cooperation. The low math group was significantly lower than the other two groups on Factor I and the total scale but not on Factor II. Group differences occurred only among boys. It was concluded that children with a disability in mathematical computation may be at risk for impulsive and possibly antisocial behavior.

To develop and evaluate an intervention strategy for children at risk of reading failure in their first year at school.



Samples. Classes in four UK infant schools with different demographic characteristics were screened to identify children most at risk of reading failure (62 in total, mean initial age 6.0 years). Control children, matched overall for age and reading performance, were selected from comparable schools.



Methods. The selected children were given an individually adaptive, curriculum-based, support programme with the emphasis on word building and phonics skills in the broad reading context. The programme was administered to children in groups of four for two half-hour sessions per week for 10 weeks.



Results. The intervention group improved significantly in mean reading standard score (from 89.0 to 92.8), whereas the control group made no overall improvement. The intervention proved cost-effective, with mean ‘effect size’ comparable to those reported for Reading Recovery, yet with only 10% of the costs. Despite the clear progress of the intervention group overall, 25% remained ‘problem readers' (with reading still at least 6 months behind). Of these problem readers 88% had initial ‘at risk’ or ‘borderline risk’ scores on the DEST screening test, compared with only 28% of the ‘recovered readers’.



Conclusions. The following three-stage intervention strategy is promising: (i) children at risk of reading difficulties are identified before 6 years; (ii) at risk children are given a small-group intervention programme for 3-4 months; (iii) children still failing to make progress may then be given continuing targeted additional support."

Denenberg mounted two main lines of criticism, one concerning characteristics of the population sampled for the experimental group, and the other a statistical critique, concerning (a) violation of parametric assumptions for use of the F distribution and (b) our supposed acceptance of the null hypothesis of no differences between experimental and control groups. We show that the first criticism stemmed from a misunderstanding of the experimental hypothesis and that the second can be answered by both parametric and nonparametric comparisons across conditions within the experimental group, without reference to the control group. Thus, our original conclusion stands: The difficulty with rapid /ba/-/da/ discrimination that some children with reading impairment may experience does not stem from difficulty in discriminating the rapid spectral transitions at stop-vowel syllable onsets."

Thresholds were estimated for detecting a brief backward-masked tone (BM), detection of frequency modulation (FM), and pitch discrimination using temporal cues (Δf 0 ). Both BM and FM thresholds improved with training, and by the 2nd test session, FM thresholds were in the adult range. There were marked individual differences on BM and Δf 0, and, for both tasks, performance correlated with Tallal’s Auditory Repetition Task administered 2 years previously. However, no auditory measure gave significant differences between LI and control groups; performance was influenced more by nonverbal than language ability. Some children did have a stable pattern of poor performance on certain auditory tasks, but their good FM detection raised questions about whether processing of auditory temporal information is abnormal.

These opposing theories were contrasted by assessing the impact of pre-school phonological skills on reading amongst children experiencing their first year of formal instruction by a NA mixed NA method. Those beginning readers who could decode nonwords were found to have accomplished this by employing their letter-sound knowledge rather than by making analogies based on familiar rime units. Children displayed this pattern of performance regardless of their pre-school rhyming skills. Further investigations revealed that explicit awareness of onset and rime units was poor, even amongst children whose implicit rhyming skills were excellent. This evidence, together with the children's knowledge of orthographic units, was consistent with the view that letter-sound correspondences rather than onset or rime units formed the basis of their first attempts to utilise phonology in reading. The findings are discussed with reference to instructional influences on early reading and phonological awareness. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V."

Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for their deficits: (i) a speech-specific failure in phonological representation and (ii) a general deficit in auditory “temporal processing,” such that they cannot easily perceive the rapid spectral changes of formant transitions at the onset of stop-vowel syllables. To test these hypotheses, two groups of second-grade children (20 “good readers,” 20 “poor readers”), matched for age and intelligence, were selected to differ significantly on a /ba/–/da/ temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, said to be diagnostic of a temporal processing deficit. Three experiments then showed that the groups did not differ in: (i) TOJ when /ba/ and /da/ were paired with more easily discriminated syllables (/ba/–/sa/, /da/–/∳a/); (ii) discriminating nonspeech sine wave analogs of the second and third formants of /ba/ and /da/; (iii) sensitivity to brief transitional cues varying along a synthetic speech continuum. Thus, poor readers’ difficulties with /ba/–/da/ reflected perceptual confusion between phonetically similar, though phonologically contrastive, syllables rather than difficulty in perceiving rapid spectral changes. The results are consistent with a speech-specific, not a general auditory, deficit."

We argue that (1) errors in temporal order judgment of both syllables and tones reflect difficulty in identifying similar (and so readily confusable) stimuli rapidly, not in judging their temporal order; (2) difficulty in identifying similar syllables or tones rapidly stem from independent deficits in speech and nonspeech discriminative capacity, not from a general deficit in rate of auditory perception; and (3) the results of dichotic experiments and studies of aphasics purporting to demonstrate left-hemisphere specialization for nonspeech auditory temporal perception are inconclusive. The paper supports its arguments with data from a recent control study. We conclude that, on the available evidence, the phonological deficit of impaired readers cannot be traced to any co-occurring nonspeech deficits so far observed and is phonetic in origin, but that its full nature, origin, and extent remain to be determined."

Thus the experiences which a child has with rhyme before he goes to school might have a considerable effect on his success later on in learning to read and to write. We now report the results of a large scale project which support this hypothesis."

They base this claim on the relative predictive success of two rhyme and two phoneme segmentation tasks. However, there is a problem with one of their two rhyme measures, the Rhyme Detection measure. The children were asked to select a choice word which “rhymes with or sounds like” a target word, but the authors only scored rhyme choices (“boat”–“coat”) as correct. Choices of words with the same onset as the target (“train”–“tractor”) were counted as mistakes, even though these latter choices also shared a common sound with the target. A better way to score the task is to count onset as well as rhyme choices as correct. The new score predicts reading and spelling as well as the phoneme tasks. This result is consistent with the hypothesis of Goswami and Bryant (1990) that sensitivity to onset and rhyme, as well as awareness of phonemes, plays a part in children's success in reading and to spelling."

Measures of phonological ability, rhyme awareness and phoneme deletion, also showed strong differences between the different reading ability groups. Regression analyses showed that rhyme awareness, phoneme deletion, and speech rate (but not verbal short-term memory) had independent predictive relationships to reading skill.

Writing systems based on the meaningless units, syllables and phonemes, were late developments in the history of written language. The alphabetic system, which requires abstraction of the phonemic unit of speech, was the last to appear, evolved from a syllabary and, unlike the other systems, was apparently invented only once. It might therefore be supposed that phoneme segmentation is particularly difficult and more difficult, indeed, than syllable segmentation. Speech research suggests reasons why this may be so. The present study provides direct evidence of a similar developmental ordering of syllable and phoneme segmentation abilities in the young child. By means of a task which required preschool, kindergarten, and first-grade children to tap out the number of segments in spoken utterances, it was found that, though ability in both syllable and phoneme segmentation increased with grade level, analysis into phonemes was significantly harder and perfected later than analysis into syllables. The relative difficulties of the different units of segmentation are discussed in relation to reading acquisition."

The strongest predictors of reading achievement were tasks tapping phonological processing skills, interdigital dexterity, and familiarity with the alphabetic code of English script. Collectively, individual attributes accounted for 63% of the variance in reading achievement at the end of Kindergarten and 59% at the end of Grade 1. A short set of five predictors offers a potentially useful screening test for the early identification of reading-disabled children. The effect of the ability composition of a child's class and school was also assessed. Significant ability-composition effects were obtained, accounting for 9% of Kindergarten and 6% of Grade 1 reading achievement variance over and above variance owing to individual factors. Peer ability was as strong a predictor of individual reading achievement as individual ability. Children emerging from primary school exhibit enormous variation in their reading achievement. Within a single school it is possible to find children who are reading at several grades above their own grade level, while other children at the same school are reading at several grades below. Furthermore, there are often substantial differences in reading achievement between schools. The source of this enormous variation in achievement has been the focus of considerable research in the last two decades.

The apparent finding that pre-readers are able to perform rhyme tasks much more readily than phoneme tasks has led some to propose that teaching children to read by drawing attention to rime units within words is ‘a route into phonemes’ (Goswami, 1999a, p. 233). Rhyme and analogy have been adopted as an integral part of the National Literacy Strategy (DfEE, 1998), a move which appears to have been influenced by three major research claims:1) rhyme awareness is related to reading ability, 2) rhyme awareness affects reading achievement, and 3) rhyme awareness leads to the development of phoneme awareness. A critical examination of the experimental research evidence from a methodological viewpoint, however, shows that not one of the three claims is sufficiently supported. Instructional implications are discussed."

Words rhyme because they share component sounds: To recognize that two words rhyme is, therefore, to know something about their component sounds. This theory was investigated in a 15-month longitudinal study which began when the children were age 3 years, 4 months. Assessments were made of their knowledge of nursery rhymes and their phonological skills, particularly the detection and production of rhyme and alliteration.

Next, normative growth rates under typical instructional conditions are contrasted with CBM growth rates derived from studies of effective practices. Finally, based on these two data sets, issues and conclusions about appropriate methods for establishing academic growth rates using CBM are discussed. As already argued in this special issue (Carnine & Granzin, this issue), the reform movement creates the context within which research-based estimates of expected progress for students with learning disabilities become critical. The press on general education to account for student progress has been mounting over the past decade. Similar pressures arise with respect to students with learning disabilities as they increasingly participate in accountability frameworks and as concern grows over the reading deficits associated with this population of learners. At the same time, recent legal decisions have increased school administrators' focus on the academic growth of students with learning disabilities. Most crucial is the Shannon Carter case (Wright, 1994), in which the courts decided that a public school's obligation to reimburse parents for a private-school education rested in part on judgments regarding the acceptability of the student's reading program. Such a decision-making framework raises questions about what constitutes ""acceptable"" academic growth for students with learning disabilities. The purpose of this article is to illustrate how one well-developed, technically strong measurement system, curriculum-based measurement (CBM), can be used to establish academic growth standards for students with learning disabilities.

Basic Concepts Underlying Use of CBM in Establishing Growth Standards CBM is a set of methods for indexing academic competence and progress. The developers of CBM (see Deno, 1985) sought to establish a measurement system that (a) teachers could use efficiently; (b) would produce accurate, meaningful information with which to index standing and growth; (c) could answer questions about the effectiveness of programs in producing academic growth; and (d) would provide information that helped teachers plan better instructional programs. To accomplish this goal, a systematic program of research, conceptualized as a 3 X 3 matrix (see Deno & Fuchs, 1987), was undertaken. The rows in this matrix specified three questions for developing a measurement system (what to measure, how to measure, and how to use the resulting database); the columns provided three criteria against which answers to those questions could be formulated (technical adequacy, treatment validity, and feasibility). A 20-year research program has addressed each cell in this matrix with multiple studies for four academic domains: reading, spelling, mathematics, and written expression. …"

Children were assessed on a variety of measures on their entry to kindergarten. Their reading success was evaluated in first grade. Further, characteristics of the language arts program to which the children were exposed in kindergarten were observed. Measures administered in kindergarten were evaluated for their ability to predict first-grade reading achievement. It was found that a child's ability to name letters in kindergarten was the strongest predictor of first-grade reading skill. Among the nonreading measures, measures of linguistic processing skills, particularly phonological processing, were found to account for the largest proportion of variance in first-grade reading. Several characteristics of the kindergarten language arts program were also found to be related to first-grade reading performance. Further, some of these relationships varied depending on the risk status of the children for experiencing later reading difficulties as determined on the basis of the prediction aspect of the study. For example, the proportion of time devoted to activities designed to attune children to the phonemic nature of language was related to first-grade reading success for “at risk” children, but not for children who were not identified as “at risk.” © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Our strategy involved establishing selection measures and criteria by calibrating indicators of RD on 1 cohort of children, testing the parameters on a new cohort, exploring the relative accuracy of predictors gathered over time, and testing the contribution of dynamic segmentation in which children received varying levels of prompts in performing the task. Discriminant analysis based on a small set of predictors yielded high hit rates in distinguishing children who exhibited an RD profile at the end of 1st grade.

The children were also administered several measures of word recognition, pseudoword reading, and reading comprehension. A series of hierarchical regression analyses and commonality analyses indicated that phonological sensitivity remained a strong predictor of reading performance after variance in working memory and syntactic processing had been partialled out. However, syntactic processing failed to predict word recognition, pseudoword reading, and reading comprehension once working memory and phonological sensitivity had been partialled. The results support the phonological limitation hypothesis of Shankweiler et al. (1992) in which it is posited that correlations between reading difficulty and deficient syntactic awareness arise as epiphenomena of deficiencies in phonological processing."

In the 2nd section we discuss how different types of current fluency interventions correspond to particular components in fluency's structure and to particular phases of its development. The last section presents an overview of an experimental fluency program that attempts to address multiple components in the development of fluent reading. Finally, we argue that increased exploration of the issues surrounding fluency and comprehension will contribute to our understanding of both reading development and dyslexia subtypes."

Studies supported by the National Institutes of Health suggested more intense intervention; however, this was precluded by limited funds.

Construct and social consequential validity were evaluated through concurrent and predictive criterion-related validity coefficients, multiple regression analyses, and classification analysis. Evidence supportive of validity was found for both fluency measures, with NWF receiving the strongest support. Both fluency measures were more sensitive to poor reader status in first grade than any other measure when reading was defined by oral reading fluency. These findings extend the usefulness of NWF to the early identification of kindergarten students."

In this study, of the 8 boys, all except one had been pushed to extremes of misery during primary school, and he had temporarily emigrated. All had been teased, humiliated, and insulted by staff, children, or both. There were five examples of extreme violence from teachers, three of which occurred under the age of nine. Of those who had not been physically attacked by teachers who could not cope, there was evidence of truancy, total demoralization, psychosomatic pains, and isolation, in addition to the risk of permanent physical damage being done while inducing artificial sickness. The boys registered a great deal of intensity, pain, or embarrassment in recalling the worst incidents, which showed in voice, gesture, eyes, increased colour, feeling hot, drawing odd doodles, or coffee consumption. The students in this study had all had years of intensive specialist help, yet their reported experiences make it clear that teachers also need to bear in mind the importance of individual reactions to failure. It is clear from this study that the type of educational failure experienced by these boys not only scars the personality but can also have damaging side behavioral side effects."

Drawing on a rich array of research on the nature and development of reading proficiency, Marilyn Adams shows educators that they need not remain trapped in the phonics versus teaching-formeaning dilemma and offers instructional alternatives. She proposes that phonies can work together with the ""whole language"" approach to teaching reading and provides an integrated treatment of the knowledge and processes involved in skillful reading, the issues surrounding their acquisition, and the implications for reading instruction Broad in scope and clearly written, ""Beginning to Read provides fresh insights into the relationship between thinking and learning. Developing the new connectionist theory as it relates to reading and its acquisition, Adams underscores the automatic nature of print perception in skillful readers while contrasting it with the attentive thought required for conceptual learning and understanding Adams reviews the history of debate over approaches to reading instruction as well as the research on their effectiveness, She consistently integrates instructional concerns with meticulous attention to research and theory from education, developmental and cognitive psychology, and linguistics. Throughout, she emphasizes the interdependence of meaning appreciation and orthographic facility in both fluent reading and its acquisition. Relevant learning theory is presented along with discussion of the roles of experience, practice, direct instruction, rules, thinking and understanding. Adams stresses the importance of preschool language andliteracy experiences and includes descriptions of those that will best prepare children for reading instruction.

Performance was studied in relation to duration of stimulus elements, interval between elements and number of elements in a sequence. No significant differences between groups were observed on visual tests. On auditory tests aphasics, but not controls, were adversely affected by decreases in duration of stimulus elements and interval between elements, and by increases in number of elements. Total duration of stimulus patterns proved critical to aphasics' performance. It is suggested that developmental aphasics are incapable of perceiving auditory information at a normal rate, and the possibility is considered that this constraint on the speed of auditory processing may underlie their language impairment."

There is still continuing interest in the role of visual factors in the aetiology of dyslexia, especially in low level impairments of the visual system.3 4 However, most research suggests that these are not its cause. The most widely accepted view today is that dyslexia is a verbal deficit5 and can be considered part of the continuum of language disorders. Indeed, converging evidence supports a specific theory, that dyslexic readers have phonological (speech) processing deficits.

Reading disabled children were impaired in making judgments with very brief tones and with stop consonant syllables at short interstimulus intervals (ISI's). They had no unusual difficulty with vowel stimuli, vowel stimuli in a white noise background, or very brief visual figures. Poor performance on the tones and stop consonants appears to be due to specific difficulty in processing very brief auditory cues. The reading disabled children also showed deficits in the perception of naturally produced words, less sharply defined category boundaries, and a greater reliance on context in making phoneme identifications. The results suggest a perceptual deficit in some reading disabled children, which interferes with the processing of phonological information."

The children were followed from the beginning of kindergarten (at the age of 6, 1 year before reading instruction in Denmark) until the beginning of the second grade. Children of dyslexic parents were found to have an increased risk of dyslexia (a 4.3 odds ratio) when dyslexia was defined as poor phonological recoding (poor reading of nonwords and pseudohomophones of real words). All language measures in kindergarten were statistically significant predictors of dyslexia. Logistic regression analyses with backwards stepwise selection indicated that three measures contributed independently to the prediction of dyslexia: letter naming, phoneme identification, and distinctness of phonological representations. The measure of distinctness of phonological representations also contributed significantly to the prediction of poor phoneme awareness in Grade 2—even when differences in early syllable and phoneme awareness, articulation, and productive and receptive vocabulary were accounted for. The results suggest that the quality of phonological representations in the mental lexicon is a determinant of the development of both segmental (e.g., phoneme) awareness and of the acquisition of phonological recoding skills in reading.

ESTE TRABAJO presenta los resultados de un estudio longitudinal de ninos hijos de padres dislexicos y normales. El seguimiento de los ninos se produjo desde el comienzo del preescolar (a la edad de seis anos, un ano antes de comenzar la ensenanza de la lectura en Dinamarca), hasta el comienzo de segundo grado. Se hallo que entre los hijos de padres dislexicos aumentaba el riesgo de dislexia (a razon del 4.3) cuando se definia la dislexia como problemas de recodificacion fonologica (problemas para leer pseudo-palabras y pseudo-homofonos de palabras reales). Todas las medidas de lenguaje tomadas en preescolar fueron predictoras de dislexia estadisticamente significativas. Los analisis de regresion logistica con seleccion por pasos indicaron que las tres medidas contribuian independientemente a la prediccion de la dislexia: nombrar letras, identificar fonemas y la precision de las representaciones fonologicas. La medida de precision de las representaciones fonologicas tambien contribuyo significativamente a predecir problemas de conciencia fonologica en segundo grado - aun cuando se tomaron en cuenta las diferencias en conciencia silabica y fonologica tempranas. Los resultados sugieren que la calidad de las representaciones fonologicas en el lexico mental es determinante tanto del desarrollo de la conciencia segmental (por ej., fonologica) como de la adquisicion de habilidades fonologicas en la lectura.

DIESER ARTIKEL stellt die Ergebnisse einer Langzeitstudie mit Kindern von dyslexischen und normal-lesenden Eltern vor. Die Kinder wurden mit Beginn des Kindergartens (im Alter von sechs, ein Jahr vor Beginn des Leseunterrichts in Danemark) bis zum Eintritt in das zweite Schuljahr betreut. Es wurde festgestellt, das Kinder von dyslexischen Eltern einem erhohten Risiko der Dyslexie unterliegen (im Wahrscheinlichkeitsverhaltnis von 4.3), wobei Dyslexie als unzureichende phonologische Wiedergabe definiert wurde (Leseschwache mit nicht-bestimmbaren Worten und scheinbaren Gleichlauten bzw. Pseudo-Homophonie bei realen Worten). Alle im Kindergarten ermittelten sprachlichen Masnahmen erwiesen sich als statistisch bedeutende Hinweise auf Dyslexie. Logistische Regressionsanalysen mit schrittweisen, ruckwirkenden Betrachtungsablaufen indizierten drei wesentliche Masnahmen, die unabhangig voneinander zur Bestimmung von Dyslexie beitragen: Buchstabieren, phonemische Unterscheidung und Deutlichkeit der phonologischen Ausdrucksweisen. Die systematische Bemessung der Deutlichkeit der phonologischen Reprasentation trug ebenfalls wesentlich zur Bestimmung eines voraussichtlich auftretenden geschwachten phonemischen Bewustseins bei Schulern in der zweiten Klasse bei, sogar wenn Unterschiede in der fruhen Erkenntnis von Silbenbildung und phonemischer Wahrnehmung, Artikulation bzw. Wortgliederung, sowie in produktiver und rezeptiver Wortbildung ermittelt wurden. Die Ergebnisse weisen daraufhin, das die Qualitat der phonologischen Vorstellungen im mentalen Lexikon ein Bestimmungsfaktor in der Entwicklung beider segmentaler (z.B. phonemischer) Aufnahmefahigkeiten und der Aneignung von phonologischen Wiedergabefahigkeiten beim Lesen ist.

Les enfants ont ete suivis du debut du jardin d'enfants (a six ans, un an avant l'enseignement de la lecture au Danemark) jusqu'au commencement de la seconde annee. On a trouve que les enfants de parents dyslexiques presentent un plus grand risque de dyslexie (4.3 fois plus) quand la dyslexie est definie comme un faible recodage phonologique (faible lecture de non-mots et de pseudo-homophones de mots reels). Tous les indicateurs langagiers au jardin d'enfants sont des predicteurs statistiquement significatifs de dyslexie. Des analyses de regression avec selection retroactive variable par variable ont montre que trois mesures contribuent independam ment a predire la dyslexie: la denomination de lettres, l'identification de phonemes, et la precision dans les representations phonologiques. La mesure de la precision dans les representations phonologiques contribue aussi de maniere significative a predire une faible conscience phonemique en deuxieme annee, meme si les differences initiales de conscience de la syllabe et du phoneme, de l'articulation, et du vocabulaire emis ou produit sont prises en consideration.

Disabled readers were highest in the Spatial category, intermediate in the Conceptual category, and lowest in the Sequential category. The high rank in the Spatial category suggests that disabled readers are strong in visual-spatial skills. The low rank in the Sequential category can be accounted for by deficits in short-term memory processes and attentional processes."

LI committed more errors, but effects of timing were comparable. The same result was obtained for a subsample of good and poor readers. Task performance predicted reading, spelling, and calculation.

Children who encounter reading difficulty tend to be deficient in the perception of spoken words, the ability to retain linguistic material in temporary memory, and the ability to comprehend certain spoken sentences, as well as in their awareness about the phonological structure of spoken words. This paper summarizes these findings and provides an explanation in terms of the requirements of skilled reading. It further reviews the results of two longitudinal studies which show that inferior performance in kindergarten tests of language skills may presage future reading problems in the first grade. Based on these studies, procedures are suggested for kindergarten screening and for some ways of aiding children who, by virtue of inferior performance on the screening tests, might be considered at risk for early reading difficulties."

As the term is used by those who study early reading development, phonological processing refers to an individual's mental operations that make use of the phonological or sound structure of oral language when he or she is learning how to decode written language. The last 20 years of research have produced a broad variety of converging evidence that at least three kinds of phonological processing skills are positively related to individual differences in the rate at which beginning reading skills are acquired (see Adams, 1990; Brady & Shankweiler, 1991; Crowder & Wagner, 1991; and Torgesen, 1993, for recent reviews of this work).

The children's scores on phonological awareness tasks as 4 year olds significantly predicted their reading and spelling ages 6 years later. Qualitative analyses of their reading and spelling processes, conducted within the framework of dual-route models of reading and spelling, indicated that children with good early phonological awareness have well-developed lexical and sublexical reading and spelling procedures. However, they show larger regularity effects in word reading and spelling, are better at nonword reading and spelling, and make more phonologically based errors in both reading and spelling than children with poor early phonological awareness. Furthermore, early phonological awareness scores are significantly related to reading regular but not irregular words. The results are interpreted to suggest that early phonological skills relate more strongly to development of sublexical than lexical processing systems."

Finding that a large percentage of children can be equally classified as SRD or SLI has repercussions for the criteria used to define an SRD, for conceptualising subgroups of learning disability, and for estimates of the incidence of SRD.

Data used in the study were compiled from the 27 individual studies comprising the Cooperative Research Program in First-Grade Reading Instruction relevant to three basic questions: (1) To what extent are various pupil, teacher, class, school, and community characteristics related to pupil achievement in first-grade reading and spelling? (2) Which of the many approaches to initial reading instruction produces superior reading and spelling achievement at the end of the first grade? (3) Is any program uniquely effective or ineffective for pupils with high or low readiness for reading? The instructional approaches evaluated included Basal, Basal plus Phonics, i.t.a., Linguistic, Language Experience, and Phonic/Linguistic. Identical information was gathered in each project concerning teacher, school, and community characteristics and common experimental guidelines were followed in all 27 studies. Results of the correlation analysis revealed that the ability to recognize letters of the alphabet prior to the beginning of reading instruction was the single best predictor of first-grade reading achievement. The analysis of methodology indicated that the various nonbasal instructional programs tended to be superior to basal programs as measured by word recognition skills of pupils after 1 year of reading instruction. Differences between basal and nonbasal programs were less consistent when measures of comprehension, spelling, rate of accuracy of reading, and word study skills constituted the criterion of reading achievement. The analysis of treatments according to level of readiness for reading revealed that no method was especially effective or ineffective for pupils of high or low readiness as measured by tests of intelligence, auditory discrimination, and letter knowledge.

En cada proyecto se recopilo informacion identica respecto de las caracteristicas del profesor, la escuela, y la comunidad, y se siguieron las mismas pautas experimentales en los 27 estudios. Los resultados del analisis correlativo revelaron que la habilidad para reconocer las letras del alfabeto, previa a la iniciacion de la ensenanza de lectura, era el unico y mejor indicador para predecir las realizaciones en lectura en el primer grado. El analisis de la metodologia indico que los diversos programas nobasicos de ensenanza tendian a ser superiores a los programas basicos, medidos en terminas de habilidades de los estudiantes para reconocer palabras despues de un ano de ensenanza de lectura. La diferencia entre programas basicos y no-basicos era menos consistente cuando medidas de compresion, deletreo, rapidez y exactitud en la lectura, y destreza en el estudio de palabras donstituyeron los criterios para las realizationes en lectura. El analisis de los tratamientos de acuerdo con el nivel de aptitud para la lectura revelo que ningun metodo era particularmente eficaz o ineficas para alumnos de alta o baja aptitud, medida por medio de pruebas de inteligencia, discriminacion auditiva y conocimiento de letras.

Die Lehrmethoden, die evaluiert wurden, umfasten grundlegenden Fibelunterricht, Fibelunterricht und Sprachlehre, das System des Anfangsalphabets (i.t.a.), Sprachlehre, Sprache im Verwendungszusammenhang und Verschriftung. In jedem Projectbereich wurden identische Informationen zu den einzelnen Merkmalen gesammelt, betreffend den Lehrer, die Schule und den Bezirk. Allgemeine Forschungsrichtlinien wurden in allen 27 Studien beachtet. Die Ergebnisse der aufeinander bezogenen Analysen zeigten, das die Fahigkeit, Buchstaben des Alphabets noch vor dem Leseunterricht zu erkennen, als beste singulare Vorhersage fur die Leistungen von Erstlesern bezeichnet werden kann.

Provided that language problems had resolved by age 5 1/2 years, literacy development was normal, but many of the children who still had verbal deficits at 5 1/2 years of age did have reading difficulties and persisting oral language impairments later on. In these children, reading comprehension tended to be poor relative to reading accuracy. Syntactic competence in the preschool period accounted for a substantial proportion of the variance in literacy attainments, after allowing for the effects of non-verbal ability. There were only weak links between expressive phonological disorders and later ability to read either meaningful text or non-words."

This disorder is typically labelled specific language impairment. Children diagnosed with specific language impairment often have accompanying reading difficulties (dyslexia)2, but not all children with reading difficulties have specific language impairment3. Some researchers claim that language impairment arises from failures specific to language or cognitive processing4–6. Others hold that language impairment results from a more elemental problem that makes affected children unable to hear the acoustic distinctions among successive brief sounds in speech7–11. Here we report the results of psycho-physical tests employing simple tones and noises showing that children with specific language impairment have severe auditory perceptual deficits for brief but not long tones in particular sound contexts. Our data support the view that language difficulties result from problems in auditory perception, and provide further information about the nature of these perceptual problems that should contribute to improving the diagnosis and treatment of language impairment and related disorders."

In 1980 steps were undertaken in Australia to commence a review of the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability (Neale, 1958) which culminated in a revision and restandardisation of the test in 1984. This paper outlines the major features of this revision and presents data on the reading performance of boys and girls from the standardisation sample drawn from two Australian states, Victoria and South Australia. The results overall suggest that girls and boys do not differ significantly in performance at different age levels, except in speed of reading (Rate) and word recognition skills (Accuracy), in their first year of schooling. It was also observed that differences exist between the original norms and the revised norms for Australian children and that continued use of the former would result in significantly biased estimation of the reading performance of Australian children."

There was a strong association between reading problems and behavioural maladjustment, as rated by parents and teachers, particularly amongst boys. It is likely that this association is responsible for the reported excess of boys in clinical samples.

This investigation compared SRDs, LDRDs and normal readers aged 7–10 years on measures of auditory temporal processing (temporal order judgement) and phonological decoding (nonword reading). LDRDs exhibited deficits in temporal order judgement compared with normal readers, from whom SRDs did not differ significantly. These findings suggest that auditory temporal processing and oral language are related; however, very large within-group variability in the auditory temporal processing data further suggests that this relationship prevails in only a proportion of disabled readers with concomitant oral language weakness. In nonword reading, LDRDs performed worst of all, but SRDs also exhibited significant deficits compared with normal readers. Taken together, our results preclude the conceptualisation of temporal processing deficits as the unitary cause of phonological and language deficits in disabled readers."

Based on their reading and intelligence scores at the end of second grade, these students were placed into nondisabled (ND), reading disabled (RD), or garden-variety poor reading (GV) groups. Although each group made gains in phonological processing, large differences were found between the ND and RD/GV groups. The RD and GV groups performed similarly on many of the tasks. Consistent with the literature, it was found that intelligence does not differentiate between good and poor readers. The most important finding of the present study was that reader-group membership at Time 4 could be very accurately determined from students' Time 1 scores. All of the children in the RD and GV groups were correctly identified, and only 3 of the 148 ND children were misclassified, indicating that children at risk for reading dif..."

Segmentation was strongly correlated with attainment in reading and spelling at the end of the first year at school, while Rhyming was not. In addition, letter name knowledge predicted both reading and spelling skill and showed an interactive effect with children's segmentation skills. By the end of the second year of school, however, rhyming had started to exert a predictive effect on spelling, but not on reading.

Large sample sizes allowed for sensitive differentiation of constructs. In the first study, 128 preschool children without any experience of formal reading instruction were tested with a battery of tasks intended to tap various aspects of phonological awareness: rhyme recognition, syllable counting, initial-phoneme matching, initial-phoneme deletion, phoneme blending, and phoneme counting. Three basic components were extracted in a principal component analysis: a phoneme factor, a syllable factor and a rhyme factor. Cross-tabulations indicated considerable dissociation between performance on phoneme, syllable, and rhyme tasks. The structural relationships were replicated on a much larger sample (n=1509) in the second study. Subjects in this study were one year older and were attending grade 1 thus providing an opportunity to test their reading achievement. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that the phonemic factor was by far the most potent predictor. However, the rhyming factor made an independent (although small) contribution to explaining the reading variance. Among the phonemic tasks, phoneme identification proved to be the most powerful predictor."

1,1990002648,phonological recoding and self teaching sine qua non of reading acquisition,1995,david l share,cognition,1,1569,344,"The self-teaching hypothesis proposes that phonological recoding functions as a self-teaching mechanism enabling the learner to independently acquire an autonomous orthographic lexicon. Successful decoding encounters with novel letter strings provide opportunities to learn word-specific print-to-meaning connections. Although it may not play a central role in skilled word recognition, phonological recoding, by virtue of its self-teaching function, is regarded as critical to successful reading acquisition. This paper elaborates the self-teaching hypothesis proposed by Jorm and Share (1983), and reviews relevant evidence. Key features of phonological recoding include an item-based rather than stage-based role in development, the progressive “lexicalization” of the process of recoding, and the importance of phonological awareness and contextual information in resolving decoding ambiguity. Although phonological skills have been shown to be primary in reading acquisition, orthographic processing appears to be an important but secondary source of individual differences. This implies an asymmetrical pattern of dissociations in both developmental and acquired reading disorders. Strong relationships between word recognition, basic phonological processing abilities and phonemic awareness are also consistent with the self-teaching notion. Finally, it is noted that current models of word recognition (both PDP and dual-route) fail to address the quintessential problem of reading acquisition - independent generation of target pronunciations for novel orthographic strings."

A causal model was postulated concering the relationships between general abilities, metalinguistic competence, and reading and spelling skills. The quantitative implications of the model were worked out by path analysis, which revealed an orderly and interpretable picture. The most invariant and important determinant of basic reading and spelling skills was the analysis of simple words. Failure and success in school could be predicted with high accuracy on the basis of preschool data. Over 70% of the children were classified correctly in the extreme quartiles as to their future school achievement. The methodological advantage of applying path analysis instead of conventional multiple regression analysis on the present problem was discussed."

1,2016336040,hierarchical regression analysis in structural equation modeling,1999,p f de jong,structural equation modeling,1,55,13,"In a hierarchical or fixed-order regression analysis, the independent variables are entered into the regression equation in a prespecified order. Such an analysis is often performed when the extra amount of variance accounted for in a dependent variable by a specific independent variable is the main focus of interest (e.g., Cohen & Cohen, 1983). For example, in the area of reading achievement, there is a general interest in the specific abilities that predict reading development. Because these specific abilities are often correlated with more general abilities, such as verbal intelligence, the latter abilities are controlled for first (e.g., Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994). An additional reason for performing a hierarchical regression analysis is that, in these research applications, as well as in many others, the independent variables are often highly correlated. When correlated independent variables are included simultaneously in the regression model, multicollinearity arises (Cohen & Cohen, 1983). Though regularly used with observed variables, hierarchical regression analysis has not been performed with latent variables. In most applications of structural equation modeling (SEM), the latent predictors have been entered simultaneously into the regression model, although in several cases hierarchical regression analysis would have been the more appropriate approach (e.g., Guthrie et al., 1998; Normandeau & Guay, 1998; Wagner et al., 1994; Wagner et al., 1997). In this article we describe how a hierarchical regression analysis may be conducted in SEM. The main procedure proposed is to perform a Cholesky or triangular decomposition of the intercorrelations among the latent predictors (Harman, 1976; Loehlin, 1996). First the procedure is described and then an example of a hierarchical regression analysis with latent variables is given. Copyright © 1999, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc."

1,2037921353,the foundations of spelling ability evidence from a 3 year longitudinal study,2001,"marketa caravolas, charles hulme, margaret j snowling",journal of memory and language,1,320,59,"The development of spelling skills was investigated at four points over the first 3 years of schooling in 153 British children. In order to uncover the developmental relationship between spelling and reading ability and to identify the component skills of spelling, children were assessed with a large battery of tests, including reading, phoneme awareness, letter-sound and letter-name knowledge, memory, and verbal and nonverbal IQ. Spelling productions were assessed both for phonological plausibility and for conventional accuracy. A path analysis revealed that phoneme segmentation and letter-sound knowledge were the precursor skills of early phonological spelling ability; in turn phonological spelling combined with reading to promote conventional spelling skill. Although initial phonological spelling ability predicted later reading, early reading ability did not influence later phonological spelling ability. These results indicate that skilled spelling requires a foundation in phonological transcoding ability which in turn enables the formation of orthographic representations. Our data also suggest that the increasingly complex and specific orthographic patterns demonstrated in children's spelling are learned through experience and instruction in both reading and spelling."
1,2060451083,foundation literacy acquisition in european orthographies,2003,"philip h k seymour, mikko aro, jane erskine, jane erskine",british journal of psychology,1,1356,23,"Several previous studies have suggested that basic decoding skills may develop less effectively in English than in some other European orthographies. The origins of this effect in the early (foundation) phase of reading acquisition are investigated through assessments of letter knowledge, familiar word reading, and simple nonword reading in English and 12 other orthographies. The results confirm that children from a majority of European countries become accurate and fluent in foundation level reading before the end of the first school year. There are some exceptions, notably in French, Portuguese, Danish, and, particularly, in English. The effects appear not to be attributable to differences in age of starting or letter knowledge. It is argued that fundamental linguistic differences in syllabic complexity and orthographic depth are responsible. Syllabic complexity selectively affects decoding, whereas orthographic depth affects both word reading and nonword reading. The rate of development in English is more than twice as slow as in the shallow orthographies. It is hypothesized that the deeper orthographies induce the implementation of a dual (logographic + alphabetic) foundation which takes more than twice as long to establish as the single foundation required for the learning of a shallow orthography."

The essence of this approach is to decompose the predictor variables in the regression into orthogonal components based on a Cholesky decomposition and to regress the dependent variable on these orthogonal components. The components may be conceived of as phantom factors that do not have their own indicators. Because the idea of sequential entry of predictors in a latent variable regression framework seems generally to be unknown, the approach was developed by de Jong for latent variable regressions. However, it equally can be used for observed variable regression or path models. In this article we show that the phantom factors are unnecessary to achieve the objectives of a hierarchical regression. We give a direct approach that is equivalent to de Jong's approach."
1,2086436060,the relationship of phonemic awareness to reading acquisition more consequence than precondition but still important,1991,"heinz wimmer, karin landerl, renate linortner, peter hummer",cognition,1,214,29,"Abstract NA NA Three studies examined the presence of phonemic awareness among Austrian children before reading instruction and its relationship to concurrent and later reading. These children were about 6–7 years of age but in the majority of cases unable to read when they entered school. Testing phonemic awareness with a newly developed, rather simple and natural vowel substitution task revealed that many children showed not a single correct response or little success. In contrast, the few readers at the beginning of grade one exhibited high phonemic awareness and after a few months of reading instruction most of the children scored at least close to perfect in the vowel substitution task. Despite this apparent effect of reading on phonemic awareness there was a specific predictive relationship between initial phonemic awareness differences and success in learning to read and to spell. In agreement with other studies it was found that phonemic awareness differences before instruction predicted the accuracy of alphabetic reading and spelling at the end of grade one independent from IQ and initial differences in letter knowledge and reading. However, closer examination of the relationship between phonemic awareness before instruction and later success in learning to read revealed a specific pattern. Children with high phonemic awareness at the beginning of grade one showed uniformly high reading and spelling achievement at the end of grade one."

The results show, first, that reading skills at the end of preschool and Grade 1 predicted subsequent spelling skills and, second, that the level of spelling skills at the beginning of preschool predicted the level of reading skills at the end of the preschool year and at the end of Grade 1. These results suggest that emerging reading and spelling form a recursive developmental pattern. The results show further that phonological awareness predicts reading and spelling in preschool, whereas letter knowledge contributes to both skills during Grade 1."

Although many studies have examined the properties of GFI as indicators of overall model fit for single-group data, there have been none to date that examine how GFIs change when between-group constraints are added to a measurement model. The lack of a consensus about what constitutes significant GFI differences places limits on measurement invariance testing. We examine 20 GFIs based on the minimum fit function. A simulation under the two-group situation was used to examine changes in the GFIs (ΔGFIs) when invariance constraints were added. Based on the results, we recommend using Δcomparative fit index, ΔGamma hat, and ΔMcDonald's Noncentrality Index to evaluate measurement invariance. These three ΔGFIs are independent of both model complexity and sample size, and are not correlated with the o..."

After outlining components of reading ability, we discuss manifest causes of reading difficulties, in terms of deficiencies in component reading skills that might lead to such difficulties. The evidence suggests that inadequate facility in word identification due, in most cases, to more basic deficits in alphabetic coding is the basic cause of difficulties in learning to read. We next discuss hypothesized deficiencies in readingrelated cognitive abilities as underlying causes of deficiencies in component reading skills. The evidence in these areas suggests that, in most cases, phonological skills deficiencies associated with phonological coding deficits are the probable causes of the disorder rather than visual, semantic, or syntactic deficits, although reading difficulties in some children may be associated with general language deficits. Hypothesized deficits in general learning abilities (e.g., attention, association learning, cross-modal transfer etc.) and low-level sensory deficits have weak validity as causal factors in specific reading disability. These inferences are, by and large, supported by research evaluating the biological foundations of dyslexia. Finally, evidence is presented in support of the idea that many poor readers are impaired because of inadequate instruction or other experiential factors. This does not mean that biological factors are not relevant, because the brain and environment interact to produce the neural networks that support reading acquisition. We conclude with a discussion of the clinical implications of the research findings, focusing on the need for enhanced instruction."
1,2100697074,the effects of spelling consistency on phonological awareness a comparison of english and german,2005,"usha goswami, johannes c ziegler, ulla richardson, ulla richardson",journal of experimental child psychology,1,106,57,"Within alphabetic languages, spelling-to-sound consistency can differ dramatically. For example, English and German are very similar in their phonological and orthographic structure but not in their consistency. In English the letter a is pronounced differently in the words bank, ball, and park, whereas in German the letter a always has the same pronunciation (e.g., Ball, Park, Bank). It is often argued that reading acquisition has a reciprocal effect on phonological awareness. As reading is acquired, therefore, spoken language representation may be affected differently for English and German children. Prior to literacy acquisition, however, phonological representation in English and German children should be similar due to the similar phonological structure of the two languages. We explored this hypothesis by comparing phonological awareness at the rime and phoneme levels in prereaders and beginning readers in English and German. Similar developmental effects were indeed observed in prereaders, but differential effects had emerged within the first year of reading instruction."

In the original study (Byrne & Fielding-Barnsley, 1991 a), preschoolers were trained with the program for 12 weeks and gained in phonemic awareness and knowledge of the alphabetic principle as compared with a control group. The children were retested at the end of kindergarten on phonemic awareness, word identification, decoding, and spelling. Children who entered school with advanced levels of phonemic awareness scored significantly higher on each of the measures. Alphabetic knowledge predicted literacy development, but phonemic awareness accounted for significant additional variance in decoding and spelling. Verbal intelligence did not influence reading and spelling performance"

It was considered that Turkish, with its systematic phonological and orthographic structure, would make different demands on the beginning reader than the languages used in many of the previous studies of literacy acquisition. First grade children were assessed using tests of phonological awareness, letter recognition, word and pseudoword recognition, spelling, syntactic awareness, and listening comprehension at the beginning of the school year. The impact of these factors on the development of word recognition, spelling, and reading comprehension was examined. The results strongly suggest that a phonologically transparent orthography fosters the early development of word recognition skills, and that phonological awareness contributes to word recognition in the early stages of reading acquisition. Once the children's word recognition performance is high, listening comprehension ability distinguishes the different levels of reading comprehension among children. These patterns of results were interpreted as reflecting the phonological and orthographic characteristics of the Turkish language and orthography."

The relationships among early phonological skills, letter knowledge, grammatical skills, and vocabulary knowledge were investigated as predictors of word recognition and reading comprehension. Word recognition skills were consistently predicted by earlier measures of letter knowledge and phoneme sensitivity (but not by vocabulary knowledge, rhyme skills, or grammatical skills). In contrast, reading comprehension was predicted by prior word recognition skills, vocabulary knowledge, and grammatical skills. The results are related to current theories about the role of phonological, grammatical, and vocabulary skills in the development of early reading skills."

Each variable showed significant genetic and unique environment influences. Multivariate analyses revealed very high genetic correlations among the variables, indicating that the same genes are involved in their aetiology. These genes are partly independent of those contributing to intelligence. A further analysis indicated that the covariation between decoding and orthographic learning is mediated by shared genes rather than by a direct causal path. The authors argue that a learning parameter, most directly assessed by orthographic learning in this study, underlies all three literacy variables. The results are also discussed in relation to Share’s self-teaching hypothesis, which may require modification. In this article we report on a behaviour-genetic analysis of orthographic learning in Grade 2 children. We examine the genetic and environmental influences on it and on its relations with spelling achievement and decoding.

Three different tasks were used: numeral reading, number word reading, and pseudoword reading. The pseudowords shared the letter patterns for onsets and rimes with the number words. The results showed that with the exception of English, pseudowords in the remaining orthographies were read with a high level of accuracy (approaching 90%) by the end of Grade 1. In contrast to accuracy, reading fluency for pseudowords was affected not only by regularity but also by other orthographic differences. The results highlight the need for a revision of English-based characterizations of reading development. The present study is an extension of Wimmer and Goswami’s (1994) comparative study of reading development in young English and German children. The main finding of Wimmer and Goswami was that 7-, 8-, and 9-year old English children had substantially more difficulties in a pseudoword reading task than German children did. Landerl’s (2000) replication supported Wimmer and Goswami’s (1994) findings: in comparison to English children, young German readers in first and second grade displayed a distinct advantage in their ability to read pseudowords with a high degree of accuracy. Another recent replication with a comparison of Spanish and Portuguese children was reported by Defior, Martos, and Cary (2002). Their results show that the pseudoword reading accuracy of Spanish and Portuguese children is relatively similar to the performance of German children and much better than that reported for English children in the aforementioned studies."
1,2126155260,iq phonological awareness and continuous naming speed related to dutch poor decoding children s performance on two word identification tests,1998,kees p van den bos,dyslexia,1,56,0,"This correlational study focuses on the relationship between word identification variables and the reading-related variables of intelligence, phonological awareness and continuous-naming speed. Subjects are from two samples of 10- to 12-year-old children who are all poor to very poor decoders, but with subnormal IQs or normal IQs. An initial analysis of the reading-related variables indicates a naming speed and an intelligence factor. The variable of phonological awareness loads substantially on the intelligence factor. Although naming speed factor scores and intelligence factor scores are both significantly correlated with the poor decoders' word identification scores, speed factor correlations are significantly larger than intelligence factor correlations. In a subsequent analysis, phonological awareness is considered as a separate factor and scores on this factor correlate only marginally with some word identification variables. With regard to comparisons of correlational data in the samples of traditionally defined discrepant poor decoders (‘dyslexics’) and non-discrepant poor decoders, it can be concluded that these are very similar. Moreover, differences between these groups on reading and reading-related tasks disappear as soon as the intelligence contribution to the variables is partialled out. Additionally, the majority of relationships are very similar for real-word and pseudoword reading performance. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

This study examines the usefulness of these assessments in kindergarten and 2nd grade. Method: Measures of phonological awareness and letter identification were administered in kindergarten, and measures of phonological awareness, phonetic decoding (i.e., nonword reading), and word reading were administered in 2nd and 4th grades to a sample of 570 children participating in a longitudinal study of reading and language impairments. Results: A path analysis indicated that kindergarten measures of phonological awareness and letter identifi cation provided information to the prediction of 2nd-grade reading. In 2nd grade, measures of reading offered information to the prediction of 4th-grade reading. Additionally, a reciprocal relationship was found between phonological awareness and word reading, with kindergarten phonological awareness predicting 2nd-grade word reading and, conversely, 2nd-grade word reading predicting 4th-grade phonological awareness. Clinical Implications: Phonological awareness assessment provides information about reading in kindergarten but loses its predictive power at 2nd grade. At that time, phonological awareness and word reading become so highly correlated that phonological awareness does not add information to the prediction of 4th-grade reading."

The primary focus is on the effects that differences in orthographic consistency might have on the process of learning to spell across alphabetic writing systems. General characteristics of alphabetic writing systems are summarized, and various indicators of orthographic consistency are discussed for one consistent (Czech) and two inconsistent (English, French) orthographies. Then, against a model of spelling development in English, the results of several studies of spelling development in relatively more consistent orthographies are considered. Together, the current findings suggest that the core component skills underlying spelling development, namely, phonological awareness and letter knowledge, are similar across alphabetic languages. However, the degree of consistency of an orthography seems to play an important mediating role in determining the rate of learning to spell. The extent to which..."

Proportions of variance due to genetic influences on kindergarten reading were estimated at .84 in Australia, .68 in the U.S., and .33 in Scandinavia. The effects of shared environment on kindergarten reading were estimated at .09 in Australia, .25 in the U.S., and .52 in Scandinavia. A similar pattern of genetic and environmental influences was obtained for kindergarten spelling. One year later when twins in all three samples had received formal literacy instruction for at least one full school year, heritability was similarly high across country, with estimated genetic influences varying between .79 and .83 for reading and between .62 and .79 for spelling. These findings indicate that the pattern of genetic and environmental influences on early reading and spelling development varies according to educational context, with genetic influence increasing as a function of increasing intensity of early instruction. Longitudinal analyses revealed genetic continuity for both reading and spelling between kindergarten and Grade 1 across country. However, a new genetic factor comes into play accounting for independent variance in reading at Grade 1 in the U.S. and Scandinavia, suggesting a change in genetic influences on reading. Implications for response-to-instruction are discussed."
1,2170893155,analyzing the development of individual differences in terms of matthew effects in reading results from a dutch longitudinal study,1998,"janwillem bast, pieter reitsma",developmental psychology,1,162,68,"The Matthew effect hypothesis provides a theoretical framework to describe the development of individual differences in reading ability. The model predicts an increase of individual differences in reading. Reciprocal relationships between reading and other factors seem to cause these increasing differences. This longitudinal study of 3 years was concerned with uncovering the existence and causes of increasing individual differences in reading in the early elementary grades. Data were analyzed within a structural equation modeling framework. The results clearly indicate increasing individual differences for word recognition skills. For reading comprehension, no such effects could be established for this limited time period. More important, some evidence for interactive relationships between reading and other cognitive skills, behaviors, and motivational factors, hypothesized to cause increasing differences between readers, was found. It is evident that not all children become proficient readers. How do individual differences in reading performance come into existence? For most children, reading development starts at school with formal education in Grade 1. However, the development of skills necessary to acquire reading skills starts well before the beginning of formal instruction in reading. Already before children enter school, large differences among them exist as a result of innate competencies and the quality and intensity of parental care invested in them (Walberg & Tsai, 1983). Taking initial differences between individuals as a starting point, the question is whether these differences remain stable or whether individuals converge or diverge in level of performance with further instruction in reading. Stability of individual differences, that is, a relative consistency of individual differences over age, has frequently been found in longitudinal studies of reading (Butler, Marsh, Sheppard, & Sheppard, 1985; Juel, 1994). However, this stability refers only to the rank ordering of participants within a certain population. The absolute performance difference between readers can increase or decline in the course of development as a result of interindividu al differences in intraindividu al change. Individual differences in reading ability do not seem to disappear with further development or to diminish over the years. Even among college students, large individual differences in their reading skills are still found (Perfetti, 1985). Thus, a decrease in variance with time is not to be expected. Instead of a decline,"
1,2172006752,a comparative quantitative analysis of greek orthographic transparency,2009,"athanassios protopapas, eleni l vlahou",behavior research methods,1,72,44,"Orthographic transparency refers to the systematicity in the mapping between orthographic letter sequences and phonological phoneme sequences in both directions, for reading and spelling. Measures of transparency previously used in the analysis of orthographies of other languages include regularity, consistency, and entropy. However, previous reports have typically been hampered by severe restrictions, such as using only monosyllables or only word-initial phonemes. Greek is sufficiently transparent to allow complete sequential alignment between graphemes and phonemes, therefore permitting full analyses at both letter and grapheme levels, using every word in its entirety. Here, we report multiple alternative measures of transparency, using both type and token counts, and compare these with estimates for other languages. We discuss the problems stemming from restricted analysis sets and the implications for psycholinguistic experimentation and computational modeling of reading and spelling."

One view holds that sensitivity to various linguistic units reflects independent abilities, whereas another holds sensitivity to these units reflects one ability. We examined relations among sensitivity to words, syllables, rhymes, and phonemes in 149 older preschool children (4- and 5-year-olds) and 109 younger preschool children (2- and 3-year-olds) who completed eight measures of phonological sensitivity and measures of print knowledge. Confirmatory factor analyses of all combinations of word, syllable, rhyme, and phoneme factors found that a one-factor model best explained the data from both groups of children (CFIs > .98). Only variance common to all phonological sensitivity skills was related to print knowledge and rudimentary decoding. Findings support a developmental conceptualization of phonological sensitivity."
1,2002139462,dyslexia theory and research,1979,frank r vellutino,NA,5,678,0,"Dyslexia is a term commonly used to refer to severe and pervasive reading impairment in otherwise normal children. Because dyslexia technically refers to reading disability in brain injured patients, organic disorder has been one of the most frequently cited reasons for why Johnny can't read. It is also one of the most misunderstood and expensive problems known to psychologists and educators. Millions of dollars are spent annually on research, assessment, and treatment programs for dyslexia from which concerned parents and teachers have sought help. Most of the research on the subject however has been characterized by poorly designed experiments, informal observations, and equivocal results.This book makes available the first systematic and comprehensive treatment of dyslexia. It carefully examines the problem, points out the flaws in many of the educational techniques currently being used for training dyslexics, and presents new theories as to what constitutes specific reading disability.The book is divided into three sections. Part I considers the various definitions of dyslexia that have been offered, discusses the problems inherent in choosing a meaningful research population, and surveys the major theories of this disorder from the turn of the century to the present.Part II examines in detail the four major conceptions of dyslexia outlined in the first section -- visual perception, intersensory integration, serial processing, and verbal processing. Here, Vellutino provides evidence suggesting that, contrary to popular belief, dyslexic children do not see letters backward. Instead, he suggests that specific reading disability is associated with deficiency or disorder in one or more aspects of linguistic functioning, or in visual-verbal association learning, and discusses research that supports these possibilities.The first two sections of the book are summarized in Part III, which also suggests areas of future research and discusses the implications of research findings for the development of assessment and treatment programs for dyslexia.The analyses, conclusions, and suggestions in this study will be of particular interest to specialists and students in developmental psychology, learning disability, education, linguistics, speech and hearing, pediatrics, neurology, and reading theory."

Although the ultimate goal of reading instruction is to help children acquire the skills necessary to comprehend text, an important subgoal for early reading instruction is to teach children to identify words accurately on the printed page. Five recent studies of methods to prevent reading difficulties were examined in light of the goal that every child should acquire adequate word reading skills during early elementary school. It was estimated that our best current methods, if applied broadly, would leave anywhere from 2% to 6% of children with inadequate word reading skills in the first and second grades. Several broad characteristics of these ""treatment resisters"" are identified, and the implications of these findings for future research are discussed."

They describe the acquisition of initial reading skills and transition to skilled reading, the nature of the reading process in adult readers, and the ways people learn from reading.The book's third part takes up questions people frequently ask about reading -- such as reading by deaf children, dyslexia, the influence of nonstandard dialects on learning to read, comparison of reading achievement across different nations and different languages, and the debatable virtues of ""speed reading."" The authors conclude that reading cannot be understood simply as associative learning -- that is, the learning of an arbitrary code connecting written symbols and their sounds.

In their attempts to increase the number of correct classifications and predictions, psychologists have developed and applied many psychometric devices, such as patterns of test responses as well as cutting scores for scales, indices, and sign lists. Since diagnostic and prognostic statements can often be made with a high degree of accuracy purely on the basis of actuarial or experience tables (referred to hereinafter as base rates), a psychometric device, to be efficient, must make possible a greater number of correct decisions than could be made in terms of the base rates alone. The efficiency of the great majority of psychometric devices reported in the clinical psychology literature is difficult or impossible to evaluate for the following reasons: a. Base rates are virtually never reported. It is, therefore, difficult to determine whether or not a given device results in a greater number of correct decisions than would be possible solely on the basis of the rates from previous experience.

L. S. Fuchs and D. Fuchs (1998) proposed that academic problems could be indexed by a dual discrepancy on level and slope of performance, relative to classmates, on curriculum-based measurement tasks. From a sample of 694 1st- and 2nd-grade children, we identified 47 children as dually discrepant in reading and compared them with 17 children identified as IQ-reading achievement discrepant and 28 children identified as low achieving. The dually discrepant children were younger and more impaired on phonological processes and teacher ratings of academic competence and social behaviors. This group also reflected the gender and racial distributions of the population. Single-point measures of fluency and phonological awareness were not sensitive indicators of reading problems, suggesting that ongoing assessment and evaluation may be necessary for valid identification."

Using meta-analysis techniques, almost 200 studies that considered the relation between SES and academic achievement were examined. Results indicated that as SES is typically defined (income, education, and/or occupation of household heads) and typically used (individuals as the unit of analysis), SES is only weakly correlated (r = .22) with academic achievement, With aggregated units of analysis, typically obtained correlations between SES and academic achievement jump to .73. Family characteristics, such as home atmosphere, sometimes incorrectly referred to as SES, are substantially correlated with academic achievement when individuals are the unit of analysis (r = .55). Factors such as grade level at which the measurement was taken, type of academic achievement measure, type of SES measure, and the year in which the data were collected are significantly correlated statistically with the magnitude of the correlation between academic achievement and SES. Variables considered in the meta-analysis accounted for 75% of the variance in observed correlation coefficients in the studies examined."

There are drawbacks to all the explications, but a relatively acceptable one is available when the independent variables have a relevant, known ordering: consider the proportion of variance of the dependent variable linearly accounted for by the first independent variable; then consider the proportion of remaining variance linearly accounted for by the second independent variable; and so on. When, however, the independent variables do not have a relevant ordering, that approach fails. The primary suggestion of this article is to rescue the idea by averaging relative importance over all orderings of the independent variables. Variations and extensions of the idea are described."

According to this view, reading ability is considered to follow a bimodal distribution, with dyslexia as the lower mode. We hypothesized that, instead, reading ability follows a normal distribution, with dyslexia at the lower end of the continuum. Methods and Results We used data from the Connecticut Longitudinal Study, a sample survey of 414 Connecticut children who entered kindergarten in 1983 and were followed as a longitudinal cohort. Dyslexia was defined in terms of a discrepancy score, which represents the difference between actual reading achievement and achievement predicted on the basis of measures of intelligence. Data were available from intelligence tests administered in grades 1, 3, and 5 and achievement tests administered yearly in grades 1 through 6.

Concurrent with the development of these technologies, metaphors associated with the readability of the brain have evolved within the scientific literature. A cursory glance at recently published articles from Nature Journals reveals many references to the brain readability metaphor, from ""developments in neuroimaging... including the reading of brain states"" to ""neurotechnologies such as brain reading.""
 NA 
With increasing interest in neurotechnology from diverse disciplines from medicine to pharmacology, the readability metaphor developed within the context of neuroimaging diagnostics has extended to include reading an individual's thoughts. In a recent publication, an interviewed cognitive neuroscientist affirmed that, even if much work is involved, ""the possibility of reading out a person's thoughts does exist."" Somehow, the purpose of cerebral imaging has shifted from a clinical diagnostic procedure to a tool for ""reading the private intentions of a person"" or ""mind-reading."" Arguably, this shift does reflect increasingly accurate diagnoses of neuropathology and our ability to ""decod[e] mental states from brain activity in humans."" Whether the metaphor discusses more traditional diagnostics or the less understood concept of mind-reading, the common factor that ties these articles together is the idea that it is possible to read the neural muddle with neuroimaging techniques. Indeed, idioms such as ""neural signature"" and ""neural code"" are now part of accepted and shared interdisciplinary terminologies (see Table 1).
 NA 
While medical writing, as a heterogeneous language, must evolve and adapt to explain scientific advances within and outside of the medical community, scientific discussions of mind reading are questionable, even if this expression is the product of a long evolution. Does the readability metaphor accurately describe our current understanding of blood flow, metabolic tissue activity, and the orientation of hydrogen atoms and its relationship to thoughts? In other words, what can scientists genuinely glean from these brain images? NA 
That the modern scientific community has embraced the possibility of brain reading through cerebral imaging makes an odd juxtaposition of an ancient, unsubstantiated medical tradition with current technologies that allow us to observe brain activity with increasing accuracy. To be fair, the metaphor of ""reading the brain"" as an explanation of neuroimaging is not without merit; it makes the description of these technologies accessible for a multiplicity of stakeholders who would otherwise have difficulty navigating the technical language that scientists frequently use. However, because brain reading is not a new concept developed by contemporary medical neuroimaging, this metaphorical language may limit the physician’s or neuroimagist’s ability to communicate the nature of their innovative observations and discoveries to the layperson."
1,1967752530,rhyme rime and the onset of reading,1989,"clare kirtley, peter bryant, morag maclean, lynette bradley",journal of experimental child psychology,1,180,24,"Abstract NA NA There is recent evidence that children naturally divide syllables into the opening consonant or consonant cluster (the onset) and the rest of the syllable (the rime). This suggests an explanation for the fact that preschool children are sensitive to rhyme, but often find tasks in which they have to isolate single phonemes extremely difficult. Words which rhyme share a common rime and thus can be categorized on that speech unit. Single phonemes on the other hand may only be part of one of these speech units. This analysis leads to some clear predictions. Young children, even children not yet able to read, should manage to categorize words on the basis of a single phoneme when the phoneme coincides with the word's onset (“cat,” “cup”) but not when it is only part of the rime (“cat,” “pit”). They should find it easier to work out that two monosyllabic words have a common vowel which is not shared by another word when all three words end with the same consonant (“lip,” “hop,” “tip”) but the odd word has a different rime than when the three words all start with the same consonant (“cap,” “can,” “cot”) and thus all share the same onset. The hypothesis also suggests that children should be aware of single phonemes when these coincide with the onset before they learn to read. We tested these predictions in two studies of children aged 5, 6, and 7 years. The results clearly support these predictions."
1,2012140045,the development of grapheme phoneme correspondence in normal and dyslexic readers,1980,margaret j snowling,journal of experimental child psychology,1,305,12,"Abstract NA NA The present experiment was concerned with the development of grapheme-phoneme conversion ability in normal and reading-age matched dyslexic readers. The use of grapheme-phoneme correspondences was observed in a recognition memory task for pronounceable nonwords. The nonwords were presented in either the visual or auditory modality and had to be recognized immediately from the converse modality, thus necessitating decoding of stimuli across modalities. The use of grapheme-phoneme correspondences increased with reading age in the normal readers but not in the dyslexics. It was postulated that dyslexics have a specific difficulty in grapheme-phoneme conversion. For them an increase in reading age is attributable mainly to an increase in size of sight vocabulary."
1,2044698258,how reading differs from object naming at the neuronal level,2006,"cathy j price, eamon mccrory, uta noppeney, andrea mechelli, c j moore, n biggio, joseph t devlin",neuroimage,1,66,42,"This paper uses whole brain functional neuroimaging in neurologically normal participants to explore how reading aloud differs from object naming in terms of neuronal implementation. In the first experiment, we directly compared brain activation during reading aloud and object naming. This revealed greater activation for reading in bilateral premotor, left posterior superior temporal and precuneus regions. In a second experiment, we segregated the object-naming system into object recognition and speech production areas by factorially manipulating the presence or absence of objects (pictures of objects or their meaningless scrambled counterparts) with the presence or absence of speech production (vocal vs. finger press responses). This demonstrated that the areas associated with speech production (object naming and repetitively saying “OK” to meaningless scrambled pictures) corresponded exactly to the areas where responses were higher for reading aloud than object naming in Experiment 1.

Collectively the results suggest that, relative to object naming, reading increases the demands on shared speech production processes. At a cognitive level, enhanced activation for reading in speech production areas may reflect the multiple and competing phonological codes that are generated from the sublexical parts of written words. At a neuronal level, it may reflect differences in the speed with which different areas are activated and integrate with one another."

They culminate in a representation of letter strings as an ordered set of abstract letter identities, a representation known as the Visual Word Form (VWF). Brain lesions in patients with pure alexia and functional imaging data suggest that the VWF is subtended by a restricted patch of left‐hemispheric fusiform cortex, which is reproducibly activated during reading. In order to determine whether the operation of this Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) depends exclusively on the visual features of stimuli, or is influenced by language‐dependent parameters, brain activations induced by words, consonant strings and chequerboards were compared in normal subjects using functional MRI (fMRI). Stimuli were presented in the left or right visual hemifield. The VWFA was identified in both a blocked‐design experiment and an event‐related experiment as a left‐hemispheric inferotemporal area showing a stronger activation to alphabetic strings than to chequerboards, and invariant for the spatial location of stimuli. In both experiments, stronger activations of the VWFA to words than to strings of consonants were observed. Considering that the VWFA is equally activated by real words and by readable pseudowords, this result demonstrates that the VWFA is initially plastic and becomes attuned to the orthographic regularities that constrain letter combination during the acquisition of literacy. Additionally, the use of split‐field stimulation shed some light on the cerebral bases of the classical right visual field (RVF) advantage in reading. A left occipital extrastriate area was found to be activated by RVF letter strings more than by chequerboards, while no symmetrical region was observed in the right hemisphere. Moreover, activations in the precuneus and the left thalamus were observed when subjects were reading RVF versus left visual field (LVF) words, and are likely to reflect the attentional component of the RVF advantage."

In Experiment 1, participants made an arm movement in one direction for word trials and pressed a button with the other hand for nonword trials. The results indicated that word frequency not only modulated the speed to initiate the arm movement, but also modulated the acceleration and force of the movement after initiation. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that word frequency and stimulus degradation produced large and additive effects on response latency, accuracy, and the force of the response after initiation. In Experiments 3 and 4, participants made the same arbitrary speech response in a modified lexical decision task for both high- and low-frequency words. The results indicated that both the onset and duration of the speech response were modulated by word frequency. The results are viewed as most consistent with an enabled response model, wherein early operations can enable appropriate action systems before central decisions are made."

Criterion-based naming rates were obtained from three types of RAN tasks: digits, letters, and letter sounds. Latency measures were obtained from the naming of regular words, exception words, nonwords and pseudohomophones; as well as button press and verbal lexical decision tasks. Regression analyses supported the hypotheses that RAN-Letters latency reflects SV processing in that its variance is uniquely accounted for by exception word naming latency and button press lexical decision latency, and that RAN-Letter Sounds latency best reflects PD processing in that its variance is uniquely accounted for by pseudohomophone and nonword naming latency. Findings are discussed in light of what the RAN tasks are measuring, implications involving visual word recognition models of reading, and the utility of the new RAN-Letter Sounds task with respect to diagnostic and remediation applications."

In this article, the language basis of dyslexia and the current research that supports and extends it are reviewed. Research continues to indicate that phonological processing deficits lie at the core of dyslexia. However, recent evidence also suggests that these deficits may underlie the difficulties of many poor readers who do not meet the traditional definitions of dyslexia (i.e., low achievers). Rather than collapse dyslexics and low achievers into a single diagnostic category, it is argued that these groups or groups like them may be differentiated on the basis of higher-level language abilities. The role of higher-level language functioning and phonological processing in reading is further considered in an expanded view of the language basis of reading disabilities. The implications this view has for the early identification and remediation of reading disabilities are also presented."

The squared sib-pair trait difference is regressed on the proportion of marker alleles the pair is estimated to share identical by descent: a significantly negative regression coefficient suggests linkage. It has been shown that a maximum likelihood method that directly models the sib-pair covariance has more power. This increase in power can also be obtained using the H-E regression procedure by changing the dependent variable from the squared difference to the mean-corrected product of the sibs' trait values. Multiple sibs in a sibship can be accommodated by allowing for the correlations between pairs of products in a generalized least squares procedure. Multiple trait loci, including epistatic interactions, involve only multiple linear regression. Multivariate traits can use the method of Amos et al. [1990] to find the linear function of the traits that maximizes the evidence for linkage, which now leads more simply to a test of significance. Multiple markers can be the basis of a multipoint analysis. Results of simulation studies for a continuous trait are presented that investigate Type I error and power. A similar general scheme can be used to study affected sib pairs, testing whether their identity by descent sharing probabilities are greater than would be expected in the absence of linkage, and to study other types of relative pairs."

Data from two twin studies were used to address the question of whether these linked deficits have a common etiology. Study 1 involved 57 MZ and 22 DZ pairs where one or both twins had specific speech/language impairment. A control group of 173 single-born children was also tested. Motor skill was assessed using a tapping task, which was carried out with left and right hands. Tapping scores were converted to scaled scores adjusted for age and sex. Unaffected twins and single-born controls did not differ in motor skill, but twins with speech and/or language impairments obtained significantly poorer tapping scores than controls. Bivariate DeFries-Fulker analysis pointed to shared genetic influence on tapping speed and a measure of speech production accuracy. In study 2, 37 twin pairs from study 1 were retested 2–3 years later and combined with 100 twin pairs from a general population sample. A timed peg-moving task was used to assess motor skill. Children with combined speech and language impairments obtained poorer peg-moving scores than unaffected children. Bivariate DeFries-Fulker analysis found significant shared genetic variance for impairments on peg-moving and on a test of nonword repetition.

The results of two further experiments indicate that the poor memory performance of the language-disordered children is unlikely to be due to either impaired perceptual processing or to slow articulation rates. Our proposal is that a deficit of phonological storage in working memory may underpin the poor memory performance of the language-disordered children, and could play a central role in their disordered language development."

Verbal short-term memory and phonological awareness skills were assessed to determine whether learning new words involved accurately representing phonological information in memory. Results showed a relationship between verbal short-term memory measures and typically developing individuals’ ability to learn the phonological form of novel words but not their ability to learn the physical referent of new words. Similarly, individuals with Down syndrome showed impaired verbal short-term memory and impaired form but not referent learning. Together, these findings specify the circumstances in which an accurate phonological representation within short-term memory is required for new word learning."

In their method the squared sib-pair trait difference is regressed on the estimated proportion of alleles at a locus shared identical by descent by sib pairs. This method has recently been improved by changing the dependent variable from the squared difference to the mean-corrected product of the sib-pair trait values, a significantly positive regression indicating linkage. Because situations arise in which the original test is more powerful, a further improvement of the H-E method occurs when the dependent variable is changed to a weighted average of the squared sib-pair trait difference and the squared sib-pair mean-corrected trait sum. Here we propose an optimal method of performing this weighting for larger sibships, allowing for the correlation between pairs within a sibship. The optimal weights are inversely proportional to the residual variances obtained from the two different regressions based on the squared sib-pair trait differences and the squared sib-pair mean-corrected trait sums, respectively, allowing for correlations among sib pairs. The proposed method is compared with the existing extension of the H-E approach for larger sibships. Control of the type I error probabilities for sibships of any size can be improved by using a generalized estimating equation approach and the robust sandwich estimate of the variance, or a Monte-Carlo permutation test."

The imperative to discover the genetic and environmental risk factors for ADHD is motivating the search for quantifiable intermediate constructs, termed endophenotypes. In this selective review, we conclude that such endophenotypes should be solidly grounded in the neurosciences. We propose that three such endophenotypes — a specific abnormality in reward-related circuitry that leads to shortened delay gradients, deficits in temporal processing that result in high intrasubject intertrial variability, and deficits in working memory — are most amenable to integrative collaborative approaches that aim to uncover the causes of ADHD."

Thus, some of the same genes may jointly influence cognitive components within and between these three disorders. We examined the plausibility of this theory in a sample of families ascertained on the basis of a child with SSD. Methods: Using the method of generalized estimating equations to solve a bivariate family predictive model we obtained measures of comorbidity and familial aggregation of SSD and LI. We then used two methods of multipoint model-free linkage analysis to evaluate SSD and LI psychometric test measures over a region previously implicated in linkage studies of RD, DYX8 region, 1p34-p36. Results: Bivariate phenotypic analyses show evidence of comorbidity and within family aggregation and coaggregation of SSD and LI. In addition, two regions on chromosome 1 show suggestive evidence of linkage. The first region was previously reported in dyslexia studies. Our maximum linkage signal in this region measured articulation (p = 0.0009) in SSD sibling pairs. The second region is characterized by processes involved in language production, with the maximum linkage signal measuring listening comprehension (p = 0.0019) using all sibling pairs. Conclusion: We conclude that the DYX8 region could bear genes controlling pleiotropic effects on SSD, LI and RD."

Here we confirm that this may be due to the large variance in magnitude and position of the linkage statistics when maximized across a region. Simulations suggest that for genes of moderate effect (locus-specific sibling relative risks As in the range 1.23-1.39), sample sizes of less than 500 affected sib pairs will give unacceptably large standard errors in the magnitudes and locations of significant linkage results. For genes of small effect (λ s NA ≤ 1.13), sample sizes in the region of 1000-2000 pairs may be required to achieve consistency of results between different studies. These figures have important implications for our confidence in location estimates for disease genes obtained from linkage studies of modest size. In particular, collection of larger data sets and/or analysis strategies such as conditioning or narrowing the phenotype definition, in order to increase the relative effect size, may be required before embarking on positional cloning."

Since the first documented cases at the beginning of the last century, it has become increasingly apparent that the reading problems of people with dyslexia form part of a heritable neurobiological syndrome. As for most cognitive and behavioural traits, phenotypic definition is fraught with difficulties and the genetic basis is complex, making the isolation of genetic risk factors a formidable challenge. Against such a background, it is notable that several recent studies have reported the localization of genes that influence dyslexia and other language-related traits.

The work was based on a large sample of 4 1/2-year-old twins, who were assessed at home on a broad range of speech and language measures as part of the Twins Early Development Study. We found that genetic factors strongly influence variation in young children's speech in typical development as well as in SLI, and that these genetic factors also account for much of the relationship between early speech and later reading. In contrast, shared environmental factors play a more dominant role for broader language skills, and in relating these skills to later reading; isolated impairments in language as opposed to speech appear to have largely environmental origins.

Clearly substantial co-morbidity exists between SLI and poor motor skill, suggesting that SLI is not a specific disorder of language, but rather that children with SLI experience a broader range of
diYculties, of which motor incoordination is one. Current theoretical explanations of SLI do not account fully for such wide-ranging diYculties and it may be useful in the future to focus on a more detailed explanation in terms of

As predicted, the phonological STM and the verb tense measures both discriminated children with risk of language impairment from low risk children, and DeFries–Fulker analysis showed that impairments on both tasks were significantly heritable. However, there was minimal phenotypic and etiological overlap between the two deficits, suggesting that different genes are implicated in causing these two kinds of language difficulty.

The speech and language deficits associated with SSD are shared with several other disorders, including dyslexia, autism, Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), and Angelman’s Syndrome (AS), raising the possibility of gene sharing. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that dyslexia and SSD share genetic susceptibility loci. The present study assesses the hypothesis that SSD also shares susceptibility loci with autism and PWS. To test this hypothesis, we examined linkage between SSD phenotypes and microsatellite markers on the chromosome 15q14–21 region, which has been associated with autism, PWS/AS, and dyslexia. Using SSD as the phenotype, we replicated linkage to the 15q14 region (P = 0.004). Further modeling revealed that this locus influenced oral-motor function, articulation and phonological memory, and that linkage at D15S118 was potentially influenced by a parent-of-origin effect (LOD score increase from 0.97 to 2.17, P = 0.0633). These results suggest shared genetic determinants in this chromosomal region for SSD, autism, and PWS/AS."

This information, in turn, can help define disorders and their perceptual and processing deficits. Initial molecular genetic studies of dyslexia, for example, appear to converge on defects in neuronal and axonal migration. Further study of individuals with abnormalities of these genes may lead to the recognition of characteristic cognitive deficits attributable to the neurological dysfunction. Such abnormalities may affect other disorders as well, and studies of co-morbidity of dyslexia with attention deficit disorder and speech sound disorder are helping to define the scope of these genes and show the etiological and cognitive commonalities between these conditions. The genetic contributions to specific language impairment (SLI) are not as well defined at this time, but similar molecular approaches are being applied to identify genes that influence SLI and comorbid disorders. While there is co-morbidity of SLI with dyslexia, it appears that most of the common genetic effects may be with the language characteristics of autism spectrum disorders rather than with dyslexia and related disorders. Identification of these genes and their neurological and cognitive effects should lay out a functional network of interacting genes and pathways that subserve language development. Understanding these processes can form the basis for refined procedures for diagnosis and treatment. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. MRDD Research Reviews 2007;13:96–105."

Findings from two experimental studies suggest that the phonological deficits of dyslexic children and adults cannot be explained in terms of impairments in low-level auditory mechanisms, but reflect higher-level language weaknesses. A study of individual differences in the pattern of reading skills in dyslexic children rejects the notion of ‘sub-types’. Instead, the findings suggest that the variation seen in reading processes can be accounted for by differences in the severity of individual children's phonological deficits, modified by compensatory factors including visual memory, perceptual speed and print exposure. Children at genetic risk who go on to be dyslexic come to the task of reading with poorly specified phonological representations in the context of a more general delay in oral language development. Their prognosis (and that of their unaffected siblings) depends upon the balance of strengths and difficulties they show, with better language skills being a protective factor. Taken together, these findings suggest that current challenges to the phonological deficit theory can be met. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

SSD has been found to be associated with later reading disability (RD), and there is also evidence for both a cognitive and etiological overlap between the two disorders. The present study tested whether SSD is linked to replicated risk loci for RD. Method: One hundred and eleven probands with SSD and their 76 siblings were tested with measures of speech, phonological memory (Nonword Repetition – NWR), and phonological awareness and genotyped for linkage markers on chromosomes 1p36, 6p22, and 15q21. Both single point and multipoint linkage were tested with multiple methods. Results: The speech and NWR phenotypes were linked to the RD loci on chromosomes 6 and 15, with suggestive results for the RD locus on chromosome 1. Conclusions: It now appears that several RD loci are pleiotropic for SSD, extending the findings of Stein et al. (2004) for the RD locus on Chromosome 3. Keywords: Behavioral genetics, comorbidity, genetic, reading disorder, speech disorder. The overall goal of the present study was to test whether speech sound disorder (SSD) is linked to risk loci for reading disability (RD), specifically those on chromosomes 1p36, 6p22, and 15q21 (see Fisher & DeFries, 2002 for a review). SSD is a common childhood disorder that affects as many as 16% of children at age 3 (Shriberg, 2002) and about 4% of children at age 6 (Shriberg, Tomblin, & McSweeny, 1999). It is defined by developmentally inappropriate errors in speech production that reduce intelligibility, and it is distinct from stuttering or mutism. In the past, SSD has been called articulation disorder and, more recently, phonological disorder. We prefer the SSD nomenclature because it recognizes that this disability has antecedents in both articulatory (sensorimotor) and phonological (cognitive-linguistic) domains. This term has been used recently in the classification of speech disorders from a genetic standpoint in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (2005; %608445). As issues of genetic etiology and phenotypic overlap are resolved, the terminology may be refined further. The rationale for hypothesizing a genetic overlap between a written language disorder, RD, and a spoken language disorder, SSD, derives from converging evidence of an association between the two disorders at three levels of analysis: symptom, cognitive, and etiological. We will next briefly review this evidence and then describe the current study."

This shift, however, occurred 2 years later in the HR group. Familial risk was continuous rather than discrete because HR children who did not become RD performed worse than LR non-RD children on some phonological and literacy measures. Finally, later RD could be predicted with moderate accuracy at age 5 years, with the strongest predictor being letter-name knowledge."

SSD is prevalent in childhood and is comorbid with disorders of language, spelling, and reading disability, or dyslexia. Previous research suggests that developmental problems in domains associated with speech and language acquisition place a child at risk for dyslexia. Recent genetic studies have identified several candidate regions for dyslexia, including one on chromosome 3 segregating in a large Finnish pedigree. To explore common genetic influences on SSD and reading, we examined linkage for several quantitative traits to markers in the pericentrometric region of chromosome 3 in 77 families ascertained through a child with SSD. The quantitative scores measured several processes underlying speech-sound production, including phonological memory, phonological representation, articulation, receptive and expressive vocabulary, and reading decoding and comprehension skills. Model-free linkage analysis was followed by identification of sib pairs with linkage and construction of core shared haplotypes. In our multipoint analyses, measures of phonological memory demonstrated the strongest linkage (marker D3S2465, NA P =5.6×10 −5 , and marker D3S3716, NA P =6.8×10 −4 ). Tests for single-word decoding also demonstrated linkage (real word reading: marker D3S2465, NA P =.004; nonsense word reading: marker D3S1595, NA P =.005). The minimum shared haplotype in sib pairs with similar trait values spans 4.9 cM and is bounded by markers D3S3049 and D3S3045. Our results suggest that domains common to SSD and dyslexia are pleiotropically influenced by a putative quantitative trait locus on chromosome 3."

Longitudinal language-test data on 87 language-impaired children assessed at the ages of four, 4half;and 5 ½years were converted to age-equivalent scores to compare the rates of development of children who recover from early language delay with those who have more persisting problems. On most measures, over the 18-month period all the children progressed by about 18 months. Thus although children with good and poor outcomes were distinguished in terms of initial level of performance, they did not differ in rate of progress. Speed on a peg-moving task was closely related to language performance. Children who had a good outcome after early language delay had significantly impaired scores at four years, but subsequently were indistinguishable from a control group. Quantitative but not qualitative differences in peg-moving performance were found for children with good and poor outcomes. No association was found between presumptive aetiological factors and language or pegboard performance. These findings are interpreted in terms of a theory which attributes specific language impairment to a maturational lag in neurological development.

Bei 87 sprachbehinderten Kindern wurden im Alter von vier, 4 ½ und 5½ Jahren Sprachtests durchgefuhrt und diese Daten wurden auf altersentsprechende Scores umgerechnet, urn die Entwicklungsraten der Kinder, die eine fruhe Sprachverzogerung uberwinden, mit denen zu vergleichen, die langerdauerde Probleme haben. In diesen 18 Monaten haben alle Kinder in den meisten Punkten schlielsich Fortschritte gemacht. Obwohl also die Kinder mit gutem wie mit schlechtem Outcome in Bezug auf den anfanglichen Leistungsstand zu unterscheiden waren, unterschieden sie sich nicht in der Fortschrittsrate. Die Geschwindigkeit bei Aufgaben, die die viso-motorische Koordination betreffen, stand in enger Relation zu den sprachlichen Leistungen. Kinder, die nach anfanglicher Sprachverzogerung einen guten Outcome hatten, hatten mit vier Jahren signifikant herabgesetzte Scores, waren aber im weiteren Verlauf von den Kontrollen nicht zu unterscheiden. Bei den Aufgaben, die die viso-motorische Koordination betreffen, fanden sich quantitative aber keine qualitativen Unterschiede bei Kindern mit guten wie mit schlechten Outcomes. Diese Befunde werden im Sinne einer Theorie interpretiert, die die spezifische Sprachstorung einer Reifungsverzogerung in der neurologischen Entwicklung zuordnet.

Alteracion especifica del lenguaje como fallo madurativo: evidencia a partir de datos longitudinales sobre el lenguaje y el desarrollo motor



Los datos de un test longitudinal del lenguaje realizado en 87 niflos con alteracion del lenguaje, evaluados a la edad de cuatro, cuatro y medio y cinco anos y medio fueron convertidos en puntajes equivalentes de edad para comparar los porcentajes de desarrollo de niflos en fase de recuperacion de un retraso precoz del lenguaje, con los de aquellos que tienen problemas persistentes. En la mayoria de las mediciones, mas alia de los 18 meses todos los ninos progresaban alrededor de 18 meses. Asi a pesar de que los niflos con un curso rico o pobre se distinguian en terminos de niveies iniciales de realizacion, no difirieron en el porcentaje de progreso. La velocidad en una tarea movil estaba en intima relaci6n con la ejecucion del lenguaje. Los niflos que tenian un buen curso posterior despues de un retraso precoz del lenguaje, tenian unos puntajes significativamente afectados a los cuatro aflos, pero posteriormente no se distinguian del grupo control. Se hallaron diferencias cuantitativas pero no cualitativas en la ejecucion movil en ninos con curso posterior bueno o malo. Estos hallazgos se interpretan de acuerdo con una teoria que atribuye la alteracion especifica del lenguaje a un fallo madurativo en el desarrollo neurologico."

They were divided randomly into experimental (E) and control (C) groups and distributed equally in two classrooms with other children (R) . Experimental group children received 37 auditory perception sessions for 15 to 20 minutes daily until all had mastered requisite skills. The AAT was administered to all 40 children, and comparisons were made between R and NR groups and between E anc C groups. Post-test results indicated significant differences between R and NR groups, between E and C groups, and between R and C groups, but not between R and E groups. Training apparently was effective in teaching phonic analysis skills necessary for successful performance on the AAT, and phonic skills were related to readiness. Tables and references are included.

In addition, they have a sufficient command of most of the phonemes that constitute their language; that is, they can pronounce most sounds clearly (Singer, 1979). The aspect of language that these young children typically lack, however, is phonemic awareness, an understanding that speech is composed of a series of individual sounds. Cat, in other words, is simply cat, a furry animal that purrs. Young children are unaware that the spoken utterance cat is a word that is made up of a series of sounds, or phonemes, /k/, /a/, and Itl (see Adams, 1990, for a thorough discussion of phonemic awareness). Whether or not a child is phonemically aware can be determined through a variety of tasks (Lewkowicz, 1980; Yopp, 1988). One task requires that the child blend a series of orally presented sounds together to form a word. For instance, given the separate sounds /r/-/u/-/n/, the child should respond with the word run. Or, a child might be asked to tell what sound he or she hears at the beginning, middle, or end of a spoken word. What sound do you hear at the end of the word stop?

Other relationships among the variables were explored via multiple regression, factor analysis, and path analysis. Developmental comparisons were made with groups of thirdand fifth-grade children.

With IQ controlled, there were no intercorrelations among measures of phonological awareness, phonetic recoding in working memory, and phonological recoding in lexical access. Thus, these results failed to substantiate the concept of a general phonological processing ability. Partial correlations controlling for IQ revealed no relationship between reading and phonological awareness or phonetic recoding in working memory. In contrast, lexical access measures were significantly, albeit moderately, correlated with word identification but not word attack. Word attack and word identification were predicted by different combinations of variables. These results suggest that lexical access ability is an important factor in reading acquisition and that different combinations of phonological processes may be related to different aspects of reading."

Each task represented one of three kinds of phonological processing: phonological awareness, phonological coding in lexical access, and phonological coding in working memory. Five alternative models of the nature of prereaders' phonological processing abilities were tested by their fit to the covariances among phonological processing tasks after IQ had been partialled out. Our results provide evidence for two coherent phonological processing abilities in prereaders that are independent of IQ: NA phonological coding in working memory NA and NA phonological coding in lexical access . Performance on common measures of phonological awareness appears to be a function of efficiency of phonological coding in working memory. Our results call into question the view that phonological awareness, narrowly defined, is what is being measured by common-awareness measures and, by implication, that phonological awareness in and of itself is consequential to successful acquisition of beginning reading skills. Rather, the ability to make productive use of phonological information in coding information may be what really matters, and whether or not awareness enables use is an important unresolved issue.

Reading ability in the third-grade children was most strongly related to vocabulary and word-recognition speed, whereas the strongest predictors of reading ability in the fifthgrade sample were vocabulary and decoding skill.

The cognitive profiles of these two groups were very similar.

Furthermore, although a significant improvement in reading achievement was observed for both experimental groups in kindergarten and first-grade children, the degree of improvement in reading ability of the first-grade children depended strongly upon the type of instruction received. That is, the children who reflected upon and discussed the value, application, and utility of phonemic awareness for the activity of reading at an explicit level performed significantly better on a transfer measure of reading achievement than the skill and drill experimental group.

One such paradox is that cognitive research has undermined the assumption of specificity in the definition of dyslexia. The assumption of specificity is the underlying premise that the cognitive problems characteristic of the dyslexic child are reasonably specific to the reading task and do not implicate broader domains of cognitive functioning. This paper demonstrates how to develop hypotheses about the cognitive deficits of dyslexic children that do not undermine the assumption of specificity. Phonological awareness is explored as one candidate process.

This article describes a language-to-reading intervention method, termed Communicative Reading Strategies, that can be effectively used to provide language intervention within the context of the child's classroom reading group. A passage from children's literature contained within a reading textbook is used to exemplify the types of language difficulties encountered in the classroom, followed by a transcript modeling principles that can be used to assist children in learning how to deal with the complexities of contextual language. Techniques such as CRS are advantageous because they enable language intervention to be provided within the classroom, resulting in benefits to the child, the classroom teacher, and the speech-language pathologist."

In this paper we report a study of two matched groups of children: one group of language-disordered children and one group of normally speaking children.

Such outmoded beliefs clutter the literature dealing with the process of reading. They interfere with the application of modern scientific concepts of language and thought to research in reading. They confuse the attempts at application of such concepts to solution of problems involved in the teaching and learning of reading. The very fact that such naive beliefs are based on common sense explains their persistent and recurrent nature. To the casual and unsophisticated observer they appear to explain, even predict, a set of phenomena in reading. This paper will deal with one such key misconception and offer a more viable scientific alternative. Simply stated, the common sense notion I seek here to refute is this: “Reading is a precise process. It involves exact, detailed, sequential perception and identification of letters, words, spelling patterns and large language units.” In phonic centered approaches to reading, the preoccupation is with precise letter identification. In word centered approaches, the focus is on word identifications. Known words are sight words, precisely named in any setting. This is not to say that those who have worked diligently in the field of reading are not aware that reading is more than precise, sequential identification. But, the common sense notion, though not adequate, continues to permeate thinking about reading. Spache (8) presents a word version of this common sense view: “Thus, in its simplest form, reading may be considered a series of word perceptions.” The teacher’s manual of the Lippincott Basic Reading (6) incorporates a letter by letter variant in the justification of its reading approach: “In short, following this program the child learns from the beginning to see words exactly as"

The extraneous cognitive requirements inherent in the tasks varied widely. The children's performance on three tasks that involved a rhyming response was at ceiling, and these tasks did not correlate with subsequent reading progress. The other seven measures were all moderately related to later reading ability and, employed in sets, were very strong predictors. The relative predictive accuracy of the phonological tasks was equal to or better than more global measures of cognitive skills such as an intelligence test and a reading readiness test. The phonological tasks had a large amount of common variance. Factor analysis revealed only one factor on which all the nonrhyming phonological tasks loaded highly. The results bolster the construct validity of phonological awareness, indicate considerable comparability and interchangeability among the tasks used to measure the construct, and are encouraging as regards the possible use of such tasks in predictive test batteries."

The program, called The ABDs of Reading, provided explicit training in phoneme analysis and phoneme blending, letter-sound correspondences, and decoding. Recent research indicating the importance of phoneme skills in beginning reading provided a rationale for the program. The results of 2 years of program evaluation in New York City classrooms for learning-disabled children indicated that the program successfully teaches general decoding strategies. That is, instructed children were able to decode novel combinations of letters that were not presented in training. No extensive teachertraining, teacher-aides, or other unusual classroom support was required. The purpose of this article is to describe an instructional program that teaches basic decoding skills to learning-disabled children, to present the rationale for its development, and to present results of field trials designed to evaluate its effectiveness.

A series of phonological oddity tasks was devised, assessing children's sensitivity to subsyllabic onset and rime units, and to phonemes. These tasks were administered to three groups of children. The first group comprised the oldest children of a sample of kindergarten children. The second and third groups comprised the youngest and oldest children from a first-grade sample. The kindergarten group was equivalent to the younger first-grade group in terms of general verbal maturity, but had not been exposed to reading instruction. The younger first-grade sample was verbally less mature than the older first-grade sample, but had equivalent exposure to reading instruction. On all tasks, both first-grade groups performed at equivalent levels, and both groups did better than the kindergarten group. In all groups, onset and rime unity oddity tasks were of equal difficulty, but phoneme oddity tasks were more difficult than rime oddity tasks. Although some of the kindergarten children could reliably focus on onset and rime units, none performed above chance on the phoneme oddity tasks. Further analyses indicated that rime/onset oddity performance explained variation in very early reading achievement more reliably than phoneme oddity performance."

Students' activities in 20 classrooms were observed, confirming that half of the classrooms followed an individualized language-experience approach and half a decoding-oriented basal reader approach. Year-end testing of the students revealed basic level reading skill to be less universally acquired in the language-experience group, but no difference in information processing and linguistic abilities between the two groups. In addition, while the various cognitive measures generally correlated positively with reading in the decoding-oriented group, significant negative correlations between linguistic ability and reading skill were observed in the language-experience group. It is argued that linguistic ability facilitates beginning reading only after a threshold of print-specific skills is acquired, and that the observed difference between the two groups stemmed primarily from their varying emphasis on systematic instruction, with corrective feedback, of these print-specific skills."

The reading attainment of working-class children, as indicated by reading test performance, is lower than that of other children but there is some evidence that it might be improved if their parents are involved more in the teaching of reading by hearing their children read at home. A study was carried out of a reading at home parental involvement project in a primary school serving a working-class area. The project was satisfactorily implemented and 76 children completed three years in it. Their reading test scores were compared to those of similar children who had passed through the school before the project. No significant improvement was found in test performance. The findings are discussed in relation to those of the Haringey Project (Tizard et al., 1982). It is hypothesised that the effects of this form of parental involvement may depend on the nature of home visiting which supports it, on the previous extent of parental involvement, or on whether the families concerned are from ethnic minorities. It is argued that there should be continued development and evaluation of parental involvement in the teaching of reading."

Children classified as novice readers were higher in both phonological sensitivity and verbal ability than nonreaders.

Furthermore, overall performance on the metalinguistic tasks was significantly correlated with each language measure when the effects of age were partialed out. In contrast, the correlation between age and metalinguistic performance was not significant once the effects of both language measures were partialed out.

Controlling for maternal language behaviour, as assessed using scales devised by Bernstein's colleagues, had little effect on the association between coaching and reading performance; controlling for coaching, however, markedly reduced the correlation between maternal language behaviour and reading performance.

Whereas evidence for this reciprocal relation has come from studies with school-age children, this study examined the relation between phonological sensitivity and letter knowledge in 97 middle-income 4- and 5-year-old children in a 1-year longitudinal study. Multiple regression analyses revealed that phonological sensitivity predicted growth in letter knowledge, and letter knowledge predicted growth in phonological sensitivity when controlling for children's age and oral language abilities. These results indicate that the reciprocal relation between reading and phonological sensitivity is present relatively early in the development of literacy skills, prior to the onset of formal reading instruction."

Hierarchical regression analyses that controlled for parents' print exposure and children's age and analytic intelligence showed that storybook exposure explained statistically significant unique variance in children's oral-language skills but not in their written-language skills. In contrast, parent teaching explained statistically significant unique variance in children's written-language skills but not in their oral-language skills. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that storybook exposure may enhance children's oral-language skills whereas additional support in the form of teaching may be necessary to enhance written-language skills. At the end of Grade 1, children's oral and written language performance accounted for 20% of the variance in word reading, but storybook exposure and parent teaching did not account for additional statistically significant unique variance.

Participaron del estudio ninos de preescolar (n = 110) y 1er. Grado (n = 47). Los analisis de regresion jerarquica, controlando la exposiscion a la lengua escrita de los padres y, la edad de los ninos y la inteligencia analitica, mostraron que la exposicion a libros de cuentos explico una proporcion unica estadisticamente significativa de la variancia en las habilidades de lenguaje oral pero no en las habilidades de lenguaje escrito. Por el contrario, la ensenanza de los padres explico una proporcion unica estadisticamente significativa de la variancia en las habilidades de lenguaje escrito pero no en las habilidades de lenguaje oral. Estos hallazgos son consistentes con la hipotesis de que la exposicion a libros de cuentos puede mejorar las habilidades de lenguaje oral de los ninos, en tanto que puede ser necesario un apoyo adicional en la forma de ensenar para mejorar las habilidades de lenguaje escrito.

Konsonant-Vokal-Konsonant] Worten und ersonnenes Buchstabieren) von Kindern im Kindergarten (n = 110) und in der 1. Klasse (n = 47). Hierarchische Regressionsanalysen zur kontrollierten Bemessung des elterlichen Aufwands an Druckmaterial, dem Alter der Kinder und deren analytischer Intelligenz zeigten, das der Bucheinflus von Geschichten statistisch eine deutliche, ausgepragte Abweichung bei der Bemessung der mundlichen Sprachfahigkeiten bei diesen Kindern aufweist, jedoch nicht bei deren Schreibfahigkeiten. Im Widerspruch dazu ergab elterlicher Unterricht statistisch wesentliche Abweichungen bei den Schreibfertigkeiten der Kinder, jedoch nicht bei deren mundlichen Sprachfahigkeiten. Diese Erkenntnisse befinden sich im Einklang mit der Hypothese, das das Anbieten bzw. Lesen von Geschichten aus Buchern mundliche Sprachfertigkeiten steigern kann, wobei zusatzliche Unterstutzung in Form von Unterricht notig werden konnte, um schriftliche Sprachfahigkeiten zu fordern. Mit Abschlus der 1. Klasse betrug die Veranderung in der mundlichen und schriftlichen Sprachleistung 20% beim Lesen von Worten, jedoch konnte die Heranfuhrung an Geschichten aus Buchern und der elterliche Unterricht statistisch nicht mehr als besonders herausragende Abweichung nachgewiesen werden. Diese Befunde lassen vermuten, das die Verbindung zwischen fruhzeitigen Sprachausbildungserfahrungen zu Hause und spateren Leseleistungen durch erworbene mundliche und schriftliche Sprachfertigkeiten der Kinder vermittelt wird.

The amount of time first-grade teachers spent reading to their students was unrelated to the reading achievement of their students. Results are discussed in terms of a “displacement theory.” In other words, teachers who read the most spent the least amount of time in teaching activities that were positively correlated with reading achievement. Further information gathered from parent questionnaires about the time they spend reading to their children and the children's independent reading reveal a positive relationship between reading achievement and the time children spend engaged with print, but no relationship between reading achievement and the amount of time parents spent reading to their children.

One connection between the two might be alphabet books. Such books typically include both letter-name information and phonological information about initial sounds (‘B is for bear’). It may be that children who are read alphabet books, and thus understand how B is for bear, will learn both letter names and be able to isolate phonemes. To examine this, we gave three treatments to different groups of prekindergarteners. In the first group, the teacher read conventional alphabet books. In the second, the teacher read books chosen to contain the letter names only, without example words to demonstrate sound values. The third group, a control, read only storybooks. We found that all groups gained in print concept and letter knowledge over the course of the study. The conventional alphabet group made significantly greater gains in phoneme awareness than the group that read books about letters without example words, suggesting that conventional alphabet books may be one route to the development of phoneme awareness."

Two classrooms of children were observed for nine-months while they attended a universityoperated preschool. The children's parents filled out questionnaires in which they described (1) their child's interest in, and knowledge about, letters and words and (2) what role they played in helping their child learn to read. Several tests and tasks were devised to measure children's conceptual knowledge of letters, printed words and the kinds of strategies they used to learn, remember, and spell words. The results indicate when, under what circumstances, and how young children begin to read. The results suggest a natural hierarchy of knowledge development in learning to read words. With considerable parental help, children realize that letters are discriminable patterns, that letters provide clues for reading, and that sounds in words are determined by letters. These three developmental levels describe more efficient approaches to reading. Specifically, as the child becomes more attracted to letters and to figuring out what words say, he/ she uses better strategies for learning and remembering words. Thus, children who are guided by parents to attend to letters, signs, and labels and are given opportunities to read, spell, and print words, learn some of the essential rudiments of reading even before going to kindergarten."

This paper reports on the amount of time 6-year-olds in inner London engage in educational activities at home, and links these results with earlier research on the association between parental help with reading and children's reading progress. The activities data were collected using a time budget approach. The median child in this sample read aloud at home about 20 minutes per week, and received about 40 minutes per week total “teaching” in reading, writing and maths outside school. Black (Afro-Caribbean) children read aloud more than white children, girls read on their own more than boys, and the more educational qualifications the mother had, the more time the children spent on all the measured educational activities. Associations between reading activities at home and reading attainment at the end of year 1 ranged from 0.13 to 0.27 but associations with progress were small. However, children who spent more time with books at home did make greater reading progress during year 1. Implications for understanding social class differences in educational attainment and for designing intervention studies are discussed."

The analysis focused on the social domains mediated by print as well as the linguistic unit and complexity of discourse text read and/or written by the participants in the homes. The analysis also examined relationships between the types and frequencies of literacy events and the emergent literacy knowledges held by the focal children. Results revealed a description of literacy practice and literacy learning which included great variability in type and frequency of literacy events across the 20 homes. The results also suggested the following patterns of relationships between home literacy practices and emergent literacy knowledge: (a) children's understanding of the intentionality of print is related to both the frequency of literacy events in the home and to their personal focus and involvement in the literacy events, (b) children knew more about the alphabetic principle and the specific forms of written language more in homes where literate members read and wrote at more complex levels of discourse for their own entertainment and leisure, and (c) parents' intentional involvement in their children's literacy learning was higher when their children began formal literacy instruction in school. Reflections on literacy as cultural practice and the ways in which school and home learning can build upon each other are discussed.

DIESE BESCHREIBENDE Studie dokumentiert Umfang und Haufigkeit von Lese- und Schreibpraktiken in 20 Familien mit niedrigem sozialokonomischen Status im Zeitraum einer ganzen Woche, wobei die daraus hervorgehenden Kenntnisse im Lesen und Schreiben an 24 Kindern im Alter von vier bis sechs Jahren gemessen wurden. Die Analyse konzentrierte sich auf die sozialen Interaktionen, die eingeleitet wurden durch gedruckte wie gesprochene Einheiten, und auf den Umfang von Gesprachen uber einen von den Teilnehmern gelesenen und/oder geschriebenen Text. Die Analyse untersuchte auch die Zusammenhange zwischen den Textsorten und der Haufigkeit von literarisierenden Erlebnissen und den daraus sich ergebenden Fahigkeiten, die sich die Zielgruppe aneignete. Die Ergebnisse erbrachten einen Zusammenhang zwischen den Tatigkeiten der Lese- und Schreibpraxis und dem Lesenlernen, wobei eine grose Bandbreite an Formen und in der Haufigkeit von Lese- wie Schreibanlassen in den 20 Familien sichtbar wurde. Die Ergebnisse legen die folgenden Beziehungsmuster in der vorschulischen Literarisierung und den sich daraus ergebenden Fahigkeiten nahe: a) Das Verstandnis der Kinder fur die Botschaft von etwas Gedrucktem hangt zusammen mit der Haufigkeit von Textangeboten in der Familie, mit dem personlichen Interesse wie mit dem personlichen Beteiligungsgrad an dem literarisierenden Ereignis. b) Kinder wusten eher Bescheid uber alphabetische Prinzipien und die spezifischen Formen der geschriebenen Sprache in solchen Familien, deren alphabetisierte Mitglieder sich einer hoheren, komplexeren Sprachebene beim Lesen und Schreiben zu ihrer Unterhaltung und zur Entspannung bedienten. c) Das Interesse der Eltern an der Literarisierung ihrer Kinder war groser zu dem Zeitpunkt, als ihre Kinder in der Schule offiziell lesen und schreiben lernten.

A further aim was to investigate possible mechanisms through which a home reading project might lead to significant reading gains.



Parents from four main target groups were visited at home and interviewed about the help which family members gave with educational activities. The groups involved were middle class families (N=30), working class families (N=40), families from largely low SES areas who had participated in a Paired Reading project a year before (N=30) and families of Asian origin (N=50). About 100 recordings were taken of home reading sessions and these were analysed in terms of parental correction strategies and interaction.



Analysis of data revealed significant differences in the helping styles adopted by the various groups and indicated that success in reading was associated with a parental helping style which emphasised comprehension and interest. The results are discussed in terms of implications for home reading projects."

Items requiring analysis of syllables into phonemes were highly correlated with each other and somewhat independent of sentence and word analysis items. The results are related to Gibson's model of reading, in which the acquisition of grapheme-phoneme correspondences is a crucial process."

Comparison was made with the parallel classes at the same schools, and with randomly chosen classes at two schools, again randomly allocated, where children were given extra reading tuition in school. This report presents cross-sectional analyses which show a highly significant improvement by children who received extra practice at home in comparison with control groups, but no comparable improvement by children who received extra help at school.

This article offers a preliminary typology of children's emergent literacy skills, a review of the evidence that relates emergent literacy to reading, and a review of the evidence for linkage between children's emergent literacy environments and the development of emergent literacy skills. We propose that emergent literacy consists of at least two distinct domains: inside-out skills (e.g., phonological awareness, letter knowledge) and outside-in skills (e.g., language, conceptual knowledge). These different domains are not the product of the same experiences and appear to be influential at different points in time during reading acquisition. Whereas outside-in skills are associated with those aspects of children's literacy environments typically measured, little is known about the origins of inside-out skills. Evidence from interventions to enhance emergent literacy suggests that relatively intensive and multifaceted interventions are needed to improve reading achievement maximally. A number of successful preschool interventions for outside-in skills exist, and computer-based tasks designed to teach children inside-out skills seem promising. Future research directions include more sophisticated multidimensional examination of emergent literacy skills and environments, better integration with reading research, and longer-term evaluation of preschool interventions. Policy implications for emergent literacy intervention and reading education are discussed."

To explore the factors that make some letter-sound correspondences easier for children to learn than others, we first analyzed knowledge of letters' sounds (and names) by 660 children between 31/2 and 71/2 years old. A second study examined preschoolers' (M age 4 years, 11 months) ability to learn various sound-letter mappings. Together, the results show that an important determinant of letter-sound knowledge is whether the sound occurs in the name of the letter and, if so, whether it is at the beginning or the end. The properties of the sound itself (consonant versus vowel, sonorant versus obstruent, stop versus continuant) appear to have little or no influence on children's learning of basic letter-sound correspondences. The findings show that children use their knowledge of letters' names when learning the letters' sounds rather than memorizing letter-sound correspondences as arbitrary pairings."

Verbal abilities remained high, and in contrast to the findings at 4;6 (reported in Crain-Thoreson & Dale, 1992), reading achievement is now at a superior level. Overall, the results are consistent with a two-phase model of reading development, in which the second phase is more closely related to language ability than the first. Phonological awareness, as indexed by a phoneme deletion task, appears to emerge as a consequence, rather than a cause, of early reading. There also appears to be a complex relationship among early interest in reading, instruction, and reading development. Differences in child interest in books and book reading may evoke variation in literacy-relevant experiences."
1,2110778189,development of phonological sensitivity in 2 to 5 year old children,1998,"christopher j lonigan, stephen r burgess, jason l anthony, theodore a barker",journal of educational psychology,1,339,45,"This study examined phonological sensitivity in 238 children from middle- to upper-income families and 118 children from lower-income families across different levels of linguistic complexity. Children ranged in age from 2 to 5 years. Overall, the results indicated that as children increased in age, phonological sensitivity both increased in absolute terms and became more stable. Significant social class differences in growth of phonological sensitivity were also obtained. Phonological sensitivity at different levels of linguistic complexity (e.g., syllables, phonemes) was substantially interrelated at each age and predicted word reading ability in older children independently of language skills and letter knowledge. These results indicate that phonological sensitivity can be assessed in young preschool children and that lower levels of phonological sensitivity may serve as developmental precursors to higher levels of phonological sensitivity. The development of phonological processing is an important precursor to the acquisition of early reading skills (e.g., Adams, 1990; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987). Phonological processing refers to the use of phonological information (i.e., the sounds of one's language) in processing written and oral language. A growing body of research indicates that individual differences in one form of phonological processing, phonological sensitivity, are causally related to the normal acquisition of beginning reading (e.g., Bryant, MacLean, Bradley, & Crossland, 1990; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994). Children who are better at detecting and manipulating syllables, rhymes, or phonemes are quicker to learn to read, and this relation is present even after variability in reading skill due to factors such as IQ, receptive vocabulary, memory skills, and social class is partialed out (Bryant et al., 1990; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987; Wagner et al., 1994). The majority of evidence linking phonological sensitivity in prereaders with the development of reading has come from studies that have assessed children's phonological sensitivity at the point of school entry but prior to formal reading instruction. For example, Share, Jorm, MacLean, and Mathews (1984) found that children's phonological sensitivity, measured at the beginning of kindergarten with a phoneme segmentation task, was the single best predictor of"

The study reported has sought not only to replicate earlier findings but to investigate significant home factors from a younger age. Literacy experiences of 42 children at ages 3, 5 and 7 were investigated, and the relationship of home factors to literacy development explored. Findings are reported concerning two outcome measures at age 7: children's reading level, as determined by the difficulty level of their school reading book, and whether or not children at age 7 were judged to have literacy difficulties. Significant factors included having favourite books at age 3; letter knowledge and parents reading to children at school entry; and at age 7, access to home computers, and parents’ knowledge of literacy teaching in school. Children with literacy difficulties owned fewer books, were less likely to read to themselves or their parents, and generally had less support for literacy at home. Implications for teachers, highlighting the relevance of home literacy, are discussed. The findings underline the importance of home factors for children's literacy development."

The results support the hypothesis that parent-preschooler reading is related to outcome measures such as language growth, emergent literacy, and reading achievement. The overall effect size of d = .59 indicates that book reading explains about 8% of the variance in the outcome measures. The results support the hypothesis that book reading, in particular, affects acquisition of the written language register. The effect of parent-preschooler reading is not dependent on the socioeconomic status of the families or on several methodological differences between the studies. However, the effect seems to become smaller as soon as children become conventional readers and are able to read on their own."

The Haringey Reading Project was a two-year educational intervention, which sought, firstly, to increase the amount of parental help given to 6–8 year-old children learning to read, and secondly, to evaluate the impact of that help on the children's reading performance. As reported previously, at the end of the project children who had taken part in the parent involvement exercise were reading better than comparable children who had acted as controls. No such improvement was apparent in children given extra reading help, on a small group basis, from a supplementary teacher in school.



Three years after the end of the project, the children were tested in reading by the LEA, as part of their routine monitoring and screening exercise for children transferring from junior to secondary schools. Analysis of these data revealed that the beneficial effects on reading performance of having taken part in the parent involvement exercise were still clearly apparent three years later. Again, no clear pattern of benefit could be seen in the children who had received extra teacher help as part of the project."

Forty–three normally developing children were given four tests of language development; twelve metalinguistic tasks measuring phonological awareness, word awareness, and structural awareness; and two measures of literacy knowledge. The results clearly demonstrated that most 3-year-olds can make metalinguistic judgments and productions in structured tasks, with overall metalinguistic performance improving with age in months. Specific metalinguistic tasks varied in difficulty and probably in developmental order. The major domains of metalinguistic awareness (phonological, word, and structural) were significantly intercorrelated and also correlated with overall linguistic skill. Literacy knowledge was positively correlated with overall metalinguistic skill and, specifically, with phonological awareness. It is concluded that, as young as age 3, children are already rapidly developing a mental framework for analyzing language structure separately from language meaning"

One group appears to activate the orthographic representation of the word and then pronounce it by reversing the spelling (e.g., “bomb” is reversed as /bamab/) while a second group pronounces the word by reversing the phonemes (e.g., “bomb” is reversed as /mab/). The second group, however, is not completely immune from the effects of activating and using orthographic information during the process of reversing speech because the spelling of the word can influence choice of the units to be reversed. The two phonemes /k/ and /s/, for example, which are typically represented by the single letter x in words such as FOX, are treated as a single phoneme in about one third of their backward utterances. Like backwards talkers, I intend to take a backwards approach to orthographic knowledge because this chapter will be concerned with the phenomenon, interpretation, and significance of the activation of orthographic information during the process of auditory word recognition."

In particular, it examines whether letter-name knowledge facilitates the learning of spellings in which the names of one or more letters can be heard in the pronunciation of the words. Preschool children who could not read any word out of context were divided into two groups on the basis of their ability to name the letters of the alphabet: one group knew the names of the letters while the other did not. Both groups were taught to read two types of simplified spellings: visual spellings, that is, spellings whose letters did not correspond to sounds in the pronunciations of the words but which were visually more salient (e.g., XQKO for the word ‘cerveja’), and phonetic spellings, that is, spellings whose letters corresponded to sounds in the pronunciation of the words (e.g., CRVA for the word ‘cerveja’). In all phonetic spellings, the name of at least one letter could be clearly heard in the pronunciation of the words. Results corroborated Ehri's hypothesis. The children who did not know the names of the letters learned to read the visual spellings more easily than the phonetic ones. On the other hand, the children who knew the names of the letters showed the opposite pattern, that is, they learned the phonetic spellings more easily than the visual ones."

In addition, 4 linguistic manipulations within 3 phonological awareness tasks were theorized to affect item difficulties. Multiple measures of IQ, verbal short-term memory, speech perception, and phonological awareness were administered to 136 3rd and 4th graders. Application of structural equation modeling revealed that IQ, speech perception, and verbal short-term memory each contributed unique variance to the phonological awareness construct. All 4 experimental linguistic manipulations influenced phonological awareness item difficulties as well. Results underscore the importance of speech perception for phonological awareness"

Longitudinal and experimental training studies are examined in detail, as these are considered most appropriate for exploring a causal hypothesis of this nature. A particular focus of our analysis is the degree to which studies to date have controlled for existing literacy skills in their participants and the influence that these skills might have on performance on phonological awareness tasks. We conclude that no study has provided unequivocal evidence that there is a causal link from competence in phonological awareness to success in reading and spelling acquisition. However, we believe that such a study is possible and outline some ideas for its design and implementation."

Two types of error involved in fitting a model are considered. The first is error of approximation which involves the fit of the model, with optimally chosen but unknown parameter values, to the population covariance matrix. The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of â€œclose fitâ€ of a model is suggested."

At the end of first grade, academic achievement was assessed. Marked group differences were observed on most measures. Most differences remained after performance IQ effects were controlled. When general verbal ability effects were controlled, differences in phonological sensitivity and word-level reading and arithmetic achievement remained. When phonological sensitivity effects were also controlled, differences remained only in arithmetic performance. The same general pattern of results was observed in converging hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Overall, the results are consistent with the view that socioeconomic status differences in word-level reading achievement are mediated partly through preexisting differences in phonological sensitivity."

Kindergartners overused letters from their own first names (or commonly used nicknames) when spelling. Kindergartners with longer names, who had more own-name letters available for intrusions, tended to produce longer spellings than did children with shorter names. Moreover, the spellings of kindergartners with long names tended to contain a lower proportion of phonetically reasonable letters than did the spellings of children with short names. These effects appeared to be confined to children who read below the first grade level. The results support the view that children’s own names play a special role in the acquisition of literacy. They further show that children choose letters in a way that reflects their experience with the letters."

In Experiment 1 (n=45), children in an experimental group learned English letter names for letter-like symbols. Some of these names contained the corresponding letter sounds, whereas others did not. Following training, children were taught the sounds of these same “letters.” Control children learned the same six letters, but with meaningful real-word labels unrelated to the sounds learned in the criterion letter-sound phase. Differences between children in the experimental and control groups indicated that letter-name knowledge had a significant impact on letter-sound learning. Furthermore, letters with names containing the relevant sound facilitated letter-sound learning, but not letters with unrelated names. The benefit of letter-name knowledge was found to depend, in part, on skill at isolating phonemes in spoken syllables. A second experiment (n=20) replicated the name-to-sound facilitation effect with a new sample of kindergarteners who participated in a fully within-subject design in which all children learned meaningless pseudoword names for letters and with phoneme class equated across related and unrelated conditions."

Prereading test results were clustered into composite scores reflecting skill interpreting environmental print, understanding how print functions, producing and decoding print, isolating phonemes, and comprehending stories. Several decontextualized language skills were assessed with a picture description task and a word definition task. Prereading skills were found to be highly intercorrelated and to relate to the ability to provide decontextualized definitions for words. Oral language measures of decontextualized skill correlated within task, but not across tasks. Social class differences were found for the prereading measures and for those oral language measures that correlated with the prereading measures. Social class differences were not found on measures of ability to provide communicatively adequate definitions or for receptive vocabulary."
1,2035546404,the importance of letter knowledge in the relationship between phonological awareness and reading,2004,ken blaiklock,journal of research in reading,1,72,0,"Previous correlational and experimental research has found a positive association between phonological awareness and reading skills. This paper provides an overview of studies in this area and shows that many studies have neglected to control for extraneous variables such as ability, phonological memory, pre-existing reading skills and letter knowledge. The paper reports on the results of a longitudinal study that took account of these variables when examining the relationship between phonological awareness and reading for a group of children during their first two years at school. Children showed rhyme awareness before they began to read but were unable to perform a phoneme deletion task until after they had developed word-reading skills. Concurrent and predictive correlations between phonological awareness scores and later reading were often significant and remained so after adjusting for verbal ability or phonological memory. Controlling for letter knowledge, however, reduced most correlations to nonsignificant levels."
1,2043652583,young children s phonological awareness and nonword repetition as a function of vocabulary development,1999,jamie l metsala,journal of educational psychology,1,467,45,"The role of vocabulary growth in the development of two reading-related phonological processes was examined. In Experiments I and 2, 4- and 5-year-olds and a sample of first graders performed better on phonological awareness tasks for word versus pseudoword stimuli, and for highly familiar versus less familiar words. Three- and 4-year-olds in Experiment 3 performed better for words with many versus few similarly sounding items in a listener's lexicon. Vocabulary was strongly associated with nonword repetition scores for 3- to 5-year olds. The shared variance of this association was accounted for by phonological awareness measures and did not appear to be due to phonological short-term memory, as previously argued. The author proposes that vocabulary growth, defined in terms of absolute size, word familiarity, and phonological similarity relations between word items, helps to explain individual differences in emerging phonological awareness and nonword repetition."

1,2056494381,children s sensitivity to syllables onsets rimes and phonemes,1996,"rebecca treiman, andrea zukowski",journal of experimental child psychology,1,149,0,"It has been argued that children's performance on phonological awareness tasks varies with the linguistic level that is tapped by the task. For example, tasks that involve syllables are thought to be easier than tasks that involve lower-level linguistic units, and tasks that tap the level of onsets are thought to be easier than tasks that require access to single phonemes. In previous research, however, the linguistic status of a unit has often been confounded with its size. Five experiments were carried out in an attempt to disentangle these variables and so to provide a better test of the linguistic status hypothesis. In the first study, preschoolers and kindergartners more readily judged that two stimuli shared a beginning sound when that sound was an onset on its own than when it was part of a cluster onset. In two additional experiments, there was an advantage for syllables over rimes in kindergarten and first-grade children when the shared units occurred in the middle syllables of trisyllabic stimuli. The superiority for syllables was largely masked in two other studies in which the stimuli that shared a unit rhymed. This latter result suggests that children's familiarity with rhyme can override the syllable advantage. Overall, the results support the linguistic status hypothesis by indicating that effects of linguistic level on phonological sensitivity cannot always be reduced to effects of unit size."

Subjects were tested initially before entering kindergarten; from 105 to 154 of the 255 kindergarten children were followed through grades 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10. A subset of cognitive tasks maintained a high relation to high school achievement scores, especially in reading. Tenth-grade self-concept of ability, expectancy for success, value of success, and perception of task difficulty showed effects of sex and academic content area, with boys generally being more favorable toward math and girls more favorable toward reading. Children's attitudes were related both to mothers' earlier ratings of their children's cognitive abilities and actual achievement scores; this was especially the case for girls. There was a negative relation between mothers' ratings and girls' attitudes toward mathematics. Sex differences in all measures throughout the 11-year period are reviewed."
1,2076728705,explaining the variance in reading ability in terms of psychological processes what have we learned,1985,keith e stanovich,annals of dyslexia,1,118,200,"After years of confusion, the literature on individual differences in reading ability is finally beginning to coalesce around a small set of general conclusions that are endorsed by the vast majority of researchers. The most fundamental is that word decoding ability accounts for a very large proportion of the variance in reading ability at all levels. Variation in word decoding skill is primarily the result of differences in phonological abilities, rather than visual processes. Less-skilled readers are not characterized by a general inability to use context to facilitate word recognition. However, situations where such readers fail to utilize context to facilitate word recognition will arise when their slow and inaccurate decoding of words renders the context useless. Less-skilled readers display performance deficits on a wide variety of short-term memory tasks, probably due to an inability to efficiently employ various memory strategies, and most certainly due to inadequate phonological coding. Less-skilled readers may have comprehension deficits that are partially independent of word decoding skill. These problems probably arise because syntactic abilities and metacognitive strategies are inadequately developed."

Data from a longitudinal study of reading acquisition are then reported. This study included assessments of phonological skills in children before they had begun to learn to read. The results of the study suggest that (a) even if learning to read is conceptualised as a sequence of stages, not all children pass through the same sequence of stages, (b) phonological awareness and reading acquisition have a reciprocal interactive causal relationship, not a unidirectional one, and (c) phonological skills can play a role in the very first stage of learning to read among phonologically adept children. Hence, it is incorrect to claim that the first stage of learning to read always involves such non-phonological procedures as “logographic” processing."

The five component model included a concepts-about-print component which influenced a graphic awareness component, which in turn influenced a phonemic awareness component, which influenced a grapheme-phoneme correspondence knowledge component, which ultimately influenced a word reading component; in addition, concepts about print also influenced grapheme-phoneme correspondence knowledge.

How does this knowledge affect their subsequent acquisition of spelling? The results of 4 experiments speak against the idea that children go through a stage of spelling development during which they are equally likely to symbolize any sequence of phonemes that matches the name of a letter with the corresponding letter. Although kindergarteners and first graders sometimes spell the nonword /var/ as «vr,» using the letter r to represent both of the phonemes in its name, they are less likely to spell the nonword /ves/ as «vs» or the nonword /tib/ as «tb.» These differences are interpreted as reflecting the phonological or sound properties of the letters' names"

Forty-three normally developing children, whose family incomes ranged from under $10,000 to over $100,000, were given 4 tests of language development; 12 metalinguistic tasks measuring phonological awareness, word awareness, and structural awareness; and 2 measures of literacy knowledge. The children's family literacy experiences were described following a parent interview. The data analysis had two main purposes. The first was to examine the family literacy experiences of the children using a qualitative analysis. The second was to describe, in a quantitative way, the relationships among family literacy experiences, socioeconomic factors, language development, metalinguistic performance, and concepts about print. The interview data revealed that, while parents varied in the emphasis they placed on literacy activities, all of the children were at least somewhat involved in literacy activities at home; family report of literacy activities was associated with family income. Quantitative analyses revealed that amount of family literacy involvement and the children's race were related to oral language development, and language development was the most powerful predictor of metalinguistic awareness. When language development was controlled statistically, family literacy and socioeconomic factors had negligible effects on metalinguistic skills; however, knowledge of print concepts was related to metalinguistic performance, especially in the phonological domain, and was associated with the children's family literacy experiences, maternal education, and race."

Programs combining a phonological and a letter training were more effective than a purely phonological training. Furthermore, training effects were stronger with posttests assessing simple decoding skills than with real-word-identification tests.

ESTE ESTUDIO investigo el curso evolutivo de las habilidades de lectura en ninos de pre-escolar y escuela primaria, asi como los antecedentes cognitivos y sociales de dicho desarrollo. Ciento noventa y seis ninos de 5 a 6 anos fueron evaluados en octubre y abril en pre-escolar y nuevamente en primer grado. Los datos incluyeron medidas de habilidad de lectura y sus antecedentes cognitivos y sociales y fueron analizados usando el metodo “Simplex and Piecewise Growth Curve Modeling.” Los resultados mostraron que, durante el ano de pre-escolar las diferencias individuales en lectura aumentaron y que este crecimiento fue mas rapido entre aquellos que entraron a preescolar con habilidades bien desarrolladas. Sin embargo, durante el primer grado, las diferencias individuales en lectura disminuyeron. Los resultados sugieren que la ensenanza sistematica de la lectura en la educacion primaria es mas beneficiosa para los ninos con habilidades de lectoescritura menos desarrolladas; en tanto que los ninos con habilidades de lectura mas desarrolladas obtienen relativamente menos beneficios de la ensenanza de la lectura en primer grado.

Following a longitudinal design, the children's decoding abilities for (1) regular CVC words, (2) complex monosyllabic words with consonant clusters in prevocalic and postvocalic position, and (3) polysyllabic words were assessed on two occasions during every grade. The results showed substantial growth across grade for all of the word decoding measures. Growth curve analyses showed a quadratic rather than a linear growth curve to optimally model the children's word decoding development. Small but significant effects of gender and linguistic diversity were observed: Girls generally did better than boys — mainly on the regular CVC word patterns. And children learning to read in Dutch as a first language generally did better than children learning to read Dutch as a second language — mainly on polysyllabic words. From a structural point of view, the development of word decoding in the different subgroups turned out to be highly comparable.

Children (n = 383) were tested individually twice each year for up to 4 years on measures of phonological awareness, decoding, reading comprehension, and vocabulary. Growth curve analyses indicated that schooling effects were greatest for decoding skills and reading comprehension, were medium in size for phonological awareness, and were less evident for vocabulary. Except for vocabulary, relatively small amounts of growth were observed for preschoolers, followed by a period of rapid growth for kindergarteners and first graders, which slowed again for second graders. Findings demonstrate the differential effect of schooling on four separate literacy skills during the crucial school transition period."

Instead, one must develop empirical benchmarks of comparison that reflect the nature of the intervention being evaluated, its target population, and the outcome measure or measures being used. This approach is applied to the assessment of effect size measures for educational interventions designed to improve student academic achievement. Three types of empirical benchmarks are illustrated: (a) normative expectations for growth over time in student achievement, (b) policy-relevant gaps in student achievement by demographic group or school performance, and (c) effect size results from past research for similar interventions and target populations. The findings can be used to help assess educational interventions, and the process of doing so can provide guidelines for how to develop and use such benchmarks in other fields."

Various immersion program designs were taken into account. The analysis confirms the results of earlier program evaluations that any lags in immersion students' achievement in reading, writing, and math disappear by grade 6. We offer two explanations to account for this result. The lag explanation holds that taking reading, writing, and math in French until the end of grade 3 creates a lag in achievement until English is introduced into the curriculum, after which immersion students catch up to regular students' performance. The selection explanation suggests that immersion test performance improves by grade 6 relative to regular English program counterparts because the composition of the grade 6 cohort is more select than that of earlier cohorts."

Other individual factors, such as motivation, and contextual factors that determine amount and type of exposure to the second language, are also central to the acquisition process and in most situations are likely to interact with cognitive factors. I argue in this chapter that the process of second-language acquisition can be clarified by distinguishing between two dimensions of proficiency that relate in specific ways to determinants of the acquisition process, namely, NA attribute-based NA and NA input-based NA aspects of proficiency. NA Attribute-based aspects of proficiency refer to those dimensions of proficiency whose acquisition is strongly influenced by relatively stable attributes of the individual learner, for example, cognitive and personality variables. Input-based aspects of proficiency, on the other hand, are considerably less related to stable attributes of the individual than they are to the quality and quantity of L2 input received from the environment. In the initial stages of acquiring the L2 the distinction between attribute- and input-based dimensions of proficiency may not be apparent but, over time, the distinctive influences of attributes and input will result in differentiation between these dimensions."

Then, using a framework developed by Farmer & Klein (1995), the proposal that a temporal processing deficit (in vision, audition, or both) might be the root cause of some proportion of cases of developmental dyslexia is introduced and various research strategies for testing this proposal are identified. The symposium papers which address this general question using a range of these strategies are then critically reviewed. It is noted that whereas reading is a recent artifact not yet subject to any direct selection pressure, its normal performance requires the use of, and connections between, the highly evolved modules for visual pattern recognition and language. Within vision and language redundant coding, which permits performance in the face of injuries and degraded input, also makes it difficult to detect subtle deficits (whether temporal, or not) unless precise tests are used. Yet such deficits may degrade performance on tasks (such as reading) which require the non-copious connections between vision and language. The efficacy of this pathway, I suggest, is measured by performance on the rapid automatized naming (RAN) test."

The need to know two or more languages is not new. Historical documents indicate that individuals and whole communities around the world have been compelled to learn other languages for centuries and they have done so for a variety of reasons -language contact, colonization, trade, education through a colonial language (e.g., Latin, Greek), and intermarriage (Lewis, 1977).

Researchers usually distinguish between 2 aspects of an individual's word knowledge: breadth and depth. In addition to these 2 factors, it may be important to also consider fluency in the study of word knowledge. Two hundred and three 3rd-grade students took part in a study that examined the relationships between 3 dimensions of word knowledge and reading comprehension. Confirmatory factor analyses, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical regression analyses show that a 2-factor model of breadth and depth/fluency provides the best fit to the data. Breadth has a stronger relationship to reading comprehension than does depth/fluency; however, the 2 dimensions of word knowledge have significant overlapping variance that contributes to the prediction of reading comprehension."

The study assessed the reading, language, and memory skills of 37 bilingual Portuguese-Canadian children, aged 9–12 years. English was their main instructional language and Portuguese was the language spoken at home. All children attended a Heritage Language Program at school where they were taught to read and write Portuguese. The children were administered word and pseudoword reading, language, and working memory tasks in English and Portuguese. The majority of the children (67%) showed at least average proficiency in both languages. The children who had low reading scores in English also had significantly lower scores on the Portuguese tasks. There was a significant relationship between the acquisition of word and pseudoword reading, working memory, and syntactic awareness skills in the two languages. The Portuguese-Canadian children who were normally achieving readers did not differ from a comparison group of monolingual English speaking normally achieving readers except that the bilingual children had significantly lower scores on the English syntactic awareness task. The bilingual reading disabled children had similar scores to the monolingual reading disabled children on word reading and working memory but lower scores on the syntactic awareness task. However, the bilingual reading disabled children had significantlyhigher scores than the monolingual English speaking reading disabled children on the English pseudoword reading test and the English spelling task, perhaps reflecting a positive transfer from the more regular grapheme phoneme conversion rules of Portuguese. In this case, bilingualism does not appear to have negative consequences for the development of reading skills. In both English and Portuguese, reading difficulties appear to be strongly related to deficits in phonological processing."

Phonological awareness in Spanish predicted (a) phonological awareness in English and (b) English word reading; thus, phonological awareness may transfer across first and second languages and across oral and written language. English VIQ and oral language proficiency predicted both English and Spanish word reading, but Spanish VIQ and oral language proficiency did not predict English word reading. In the second study, the 4 males and the 4 females with the lowest reading achievement participated in an instructional design experiment in which empirically supported instructional components for teaching beginning reading to monlingual English speakers were included. These components were phonological awareness training (in both Spanish and English), explicit instruction in alphabetic principle (in English), and repeated reading of engaging English text with comprehension monitoring (in English). Both individual students and the group as a whole increased in real-word reading and pseudoword reading beyond the level expected on the basis of their Spanish or English VIQ or oral proficiency.

A model in which L1 proficiency predicted English (L2) reading ability, which in turn predicted high school achievement and distal educational/occupational attainment, fit the data well for the full LEP sample and a Hispanic subsample. In Hispanics, the model explained 24.1%, 7.4%, 29.4%, and 46.3% of the variance in initial English reading level, English reading growth, high school achievement, and post-high school attainment, respectively. Model fit for an Asian subsample, however, was poor. Possible reasons for lack of group invariance include cultural differences in construct conceptualization, greater linguistic and cultural heterogeneity within the Asian subgroup, and cross-language transfer difficulties when L1 and L2 lack a shared alphabetic structure. At least for Hispanic LEP students, this study's results establish the theoretical foundation for exploring the effectiveness of specific educational interventions."
1,2056831274,is nonword repetition a test of phonological memory or long term knowledge it all depends on the nonwords,1995,susan e gathercole,memory & cognition,1,391,39,"The extent to which children's performance on tests of nonword repetition is constrained by phonological working memory and long-term lexical knowledge was investigated in a longitudinal study of 70 children tested at 4 and 5 years of age. At each time of testing, measures of nonword repetition, memory span, and vocabulary knowledge were obtained. Reading ability was also assessed at 5 years. At both ages, repetition accuracy was greater for nonwords of high- rather than low-rated wordlikeness, and memory-span measures were more closely related to repetition accuracy for the low-wordlike than for the high-wordlike stimuli. It is argued that these findings indicate that nonword repetition for unwordlike stimuli is largely dependent on phonological memory, whereas repetition for wordlike items is also mediated by long-term lexical knowledge and is therefore less sensitive to phonological memory constraints. Reading achievement was selectively linked with earlier repetition scores for low-wordlike nonwords, suggesting a phonological memory contribution in the early stages of reading development. Vocabulary knowledge was associated with repetition accuracy for both low- and high-wordlike nonwords, consistent with the notion that lexical knowledge and nonword repetition share a reciprocal developmental relationship."

There was a significant relationship between English and Italian across all phonological tasks. The relationship was less evident for syntactic skills and was generally absent for working memory measures. Analyses of phonological, syntactic, and memory processes based on levels of skill in English reading showed significantly better performance by skilled readers compared to less skilled readers; this was also true for the 11- to 13-year-olds compared to the 9- to 10-year-olds. Similar results were obtained as a function of levels of skill in Italian reading. On all Italian tasks, the bilingual children lagged behind monolingual children matched on age. However, less skilled and skilled bilingual Italian children had significantly higher scores than monolingual English–Canadian children (with comparable reading skills) on English tasks involving reading, spelling, syntactic awareness, and working memory. The results suggest that English–Italian interdependence is most clearly related to phonological processing, but it may influence other linguistic modules. In addition, exposure to a language with more predictable grapheme–phoneme correspondences, such as Italian, may enhance phonological skills in English."

1,2073910028,cross linguistic transfer in literacy development and implications for language learners,2002,aydin y durgunoglu,annals of dyslexia,1,235,57,"One of the challenges for educators working in multilingual settings has been to identify the causes of reading difficulties of language learners (LLs). It is difficult to distinguish between reading problems stemming from low levels of linguistic proficiency versus more general reading/learning difficulties. There is now growing research evidence of cross-language transfer in different literacy processes. Literacy components that reflect language-independent, metacognitive/metalinguistic processes show similarities across the two languages of students. Some examples are phonological awareness, syntactic awareness, knowledge of genres and meaning-making strategies. A possible way to use cross-language transfer as a diagnostic tool is proposed. If children have had enough exposure to and possibly instruction in their first language (L1), we can assess their skills and insights in L1. For LLs who have these skills and insights in their strong L1, we can expect transfer to their second language (L2). If they do not have these skills and insights in their L2 yet, it indicates a delay due to limited language proficiency, and not because of a disability. This way LLs who just need more L2 practice and exposure can be distinguished from those LLs who truly have special needs."

Tasks of PA, including blending nonwords, segmenting words, and phoneme elision, were measured in Spanish and in English and analyzed via multilevel confirmatory factor analysis at the task level. Results showed that the PA tasks defined a unitary construct at both the student and classroom levels in each language. English and Spanish PA factors were related to each other (.93 and .83 at the student and classroom levels, respectively) as well as to word reading, both within languages (correlations estimated between .74 and .93) and across languages (correlations estimated between .47 and .79). Although the PA constructs were statistically separable in each language, the high correlation between Spanish and English PA indicates considerable overlap in these abilities."

Ninety-eight 6-year-old Turkish children, living in the Netherlands since infancy, were selected prior to their entrance into the first grade of primary school. A longitudinal design monitored the development of lexical, morphosyntactic, pragmatic, phonological, and literacy abilities in the children's first and second languages. To minimize test-bias, I developed linguistic tasks, which required minimal instruction, analyzing interdependence relationships in bilingual development with LISREL techniques. The results clearly show that at the level of lexicon and syntax, language transfer was quite limited. At the level of pragmatic skills, phonological skills, and literacy skills, however, positive evidence appeared for the interdependence in bilingual development."

This study investigated vocabulary and literacy in 81 children aged 8 to 10 years. In regression analyses, vocabulary accounted for unique variance in exception word reading and reading comprehension, but not text reading accuracy, decoding, or regular word reading. Consistent with these data, children with poor reading comprehension exhibited oral vocabulary weaknesses and read fewer exception words correctly. These findings demonstrate that oral vocabulary is associated with some, but not all, reading skills. Results are discussed in terms of current models of reading development."

This paper examines what the relationships are between FRD and these skills, and whether deficits in speech, language and phonological processing fully account for the increased risk of dyslexia in children with FRD. One hundred and fifty-three 4–6-year-old children, 44 of whom had FRD, completed a battery of speech, language, phonology and literacy tasks. Word reading and spelling were retested 6 months later, and text reading accuracy and reading comprehension were tested 3 years later. The children with FRD were at increased risk of developing difficulties in reading accuracy, but not reading comprehension. Four groups were compared: good and poor readers with and without FRD. In most cases good readers outperformed poor readers regardless of family history, but there was an effect of family history on naming and nonword repetition regardless of literacy outcome, suggesting a role for speech production skills as an endophenotype of dyslexia. Phonological processing predicted spelling, while language predicted text reading accuracy and comprehension. FRD was a significant additional predictor of reading and spelling after controlling for speech production, language and phonological processing, suggesting that children with FRD show additional difficulties in literacy that cannot be fully explained in terms of their language and phonological skills."

However, the family risk of dyslexia was continuous, and high-risk children who did not fulfil criteria for reading impairment at 8 years performed as poorly at age 6 as did high-risk impaired children on tests of grapheme–phoneme knowledge. The findings are interpreted within an interactive model of reading development in which problems in establishing a phonological pathway in dyslexic families may be compensated early by children who have strong language skills."

We review expressions for calculating these measures and for transforming them back and forth, and describe how to adjust formulas for obtaining g or d from t, or r from g, when the sample sizes are unequal. The real-life implications of d or g calculated from t become problematic when there are more than two groups, but the correlational approach is adaptable and interpretable, although more complex than in the case of two groups.

Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, 180 children from 15 UK nursery schools (n = 12 from each setting; Mage = 4;0) were randomly allocated to receive a 30-week oral language intervention or to a waiting control group. Children in the intervention group received 30 weeks of oral language intervention, beginning in nursery (preschool), in three group sessions per week, continuing with daily sessions on transition to Reception class (pre-Year 1). The intervention was delivered by nursery staff and teaching assistants trained and supported by the research team. Following screening, children were assessed preintervention, following completion of the intervention and after a 6-month delay. Results: Children in the intervention group showed significantly better performance on measures of oral language and spoken narrative skills than children in the waiting control group immediately after the 30 week intervention and after a 6 month delay. Gains in word-level literacy skills were weaker, though clear improvements were observed on measures of phonological awareness. Importantly, improvements in oral language skills generalized to a standardized measure of reading comprehension at maintenance test. Conclusions: Early intervention for children with oral language difficulties is effective and can successfully support the skills, which underpin reading comprehension.

However, the neural mechanisms associated with the relative advantages of early communication success, or the disadvantages of having delayed language development, are not well explored. In this study, 174 elementary school-age children whose parents reported that they started forming sentences ‘early’, ‘on-time’ or ‘late’ were evaluated with standardized measures of language, reading and spelling. All oral and written language measures revealed consistent patterns for ‘early’ talkers to have the highest level of performance and ‘late’ talkers to have the lowest level of performance. We report functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a subset of early, on-time and late talkers matched for age, gender and performance intelligence quotient that allows evaluation of neural activation patterns produced while listening to and reading real words and pronounceable non-words. Activation in bilateral thalamus and putamen, and left insula and superior temporal gyrus during these tasks was significantly lower in late talkers, demonstrating that residual effects of being a late talker are found not only in behavioural tests of oral and written language, but also in distributed cortical-subcortical neural circuits underlying speech and print processing. Moreover, these findings suggest that the age of functional language acquisition can have long-reaching effects on reading and language behaviour, and on the corresponding neurocircuitry that supports linguistic function into the school-age years."

This study used data from a large sample of 4[fraction one-half]-year-old twins who were tested on measures assessing articulation, phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and verbal memory. Phenotypic analysis suggested two latent factors: articulation (2 measures) and general language (the remaining 7), and a genetic model incorporating these factors provided a good fit to the data. Almost all genetic and shared environmental influences on the 9 measures acted through the two latent factors. There was also substantial aetiological overlap between the two latent factors, with a genetic correlation of 0·64 and shared environment correlation of 1·00. We conclude that to a large extent, the same genetic and environmental factors underlie the development of individual differences in a wide range of linguistic skills."

Method: The preschool language skills of 112 children at family risk of dyslexia (FR) at ages 3½ and 4½ were compared with those of children with SLI and typically developing (TD) controls. Results: Children at FR showed two different profiles: one third of the group resembled the children with SLI and scored poorly across multiple domains of language including phonology. As a group, the remaining children had difficulties on tasks tapping phonological skills at T1 and T2. At the individual level, we confirmed that some FR children had both phonological and broader oral language difficulties (compared with TD controls), some had only phonological difficulties and some appeared to be developing typically. Conclusions: We have highlighted the early overlap between family risk of dyslexia and SLI. A family history of dyslexia carries an increased risk for SLI and the two disorders both show an increased incidence of phonological deficits which appear to a proximal risk factor for developing a reading impairment.

The results of a longitudinal study of first grade readers support this claim. Children were tested at four points throughout the year on tasks of syn thesis (phoneme blending) and analysis (deletion and tapping). Analyses of the tasks emphasize the differing cognitive demands of phoneme synthesis and pho neme deletion. According to the results of partial time-lag correlations, the dele tion task in particular taps a phonemic knowledge that is truly reciprocal in its re lation to reading. Gains in reading enable gains in deletion which enable further gains in reading. The synthesis task taps a more primitive phonemic knowledge that has a simple (nonreciprocal) enabling relationship to reading gains."

Since dyslexia has a multifactorial etiology, this question can be restated as: what are the factors that put children at high risk for developing dyslexia? It is argued that a useful theoretical framework to address this question is Pennington’s (2006) multiple deficit model (MDM). This model replaces models that attribute dyslexia to a single underlying cause. Subsequently, the generalist genes hypothesis for learning (dis)abilities (Plomin and Kovas, 2005) is described and integrated with the MDM. Next, findings are presented from a longitudinal study with children at family risk for dyslexia. Such studies can contribute to testing and specifying the MDM. In this study, risk factors at both the child and family level were investigated. This led to the proposed intergenerational MDM, in which both parents confer liability via intertwined genetic and environmental pathways.

NA —There is strong evidence that developmental dyslexia is both familial and heritable, but the mode of genetic transmission has remained unclear. In this article, we examine specific genetic hypotheses about the mode of transmission of developmental dyslexia by performing complex segregation analyses. NA Design. NA —A family study method was applied, whereby the relatives of dyslexic probands were examined for dyslexia. The families studied represent four independently ascertained samples. NA Setting. NA —The four samples of families were primarily from rural and suburban communities of Colorado, Washington State, and Iowa. NA Participants. NA — A total of 204 families and 1698 individuals in the four samples combined. NA Main Outcome Measures. NA —The complex segregation program, POINTER, was used to test competing genetic hypotheses of how a categorical trait (dyslexia) is transmitted in families. NA Results. NA —The results were consistent with major locus transmission in three of four samples and with polygenic transmission in the fourth. In these three samples, the estimates of penetrance for the AA, Aa , and aa genotypes (where A is the abnormal allele) were, respectively, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.001 to 0.039 in males, and 0.560 to 1.000, 0.550 to 0.897, and 0.000 in females. The estimated gene frequency of the major locus was between 3% and 5%. NA Conclusions. NA —Sex-influenced, additive, or dominant transmission occurs in a significant proportion of dyslexic families. Other evidence indicates, however, that dyslexia is etiologically heterogeneous and that there is genetic heterogeneity even among families selected for apparent dominant transmission. Thus, while no single major locus may account for all of dyslexia, it is important to pursue potential major loci for dyslexia using linkage techniques. NA (JAMA. 1991;266:1527-1534)"

Sixteen dyslexic and 16 control university students were administered a full battery of psychometric, phonological, auditory, visual and cerebellar tests. Individual data reveal that all 16 dyslexics suffer from a phonological deficit, 10 from an auditory deficit, four from a motor deficit and two from a visual magnocellular deficit. Results suggest that a phonological deficit can appear in the absence of any other sensory or motor disorder, and is sufficient to cause a literacy impairment, as demonstrated by five of the dyslexics. Auditory disorders, when present, aggravate the phonological deficit, hence the literacy impairment. However, auditory deficits cannot be characterized simply as rapid auditory processing problems, as would be predicted by the magnocellular theory. Nor are they restricted to speech. Contrary to the cerebellar theory, we find little support for the notion that motor impairments, when found, have a cerebellar origin or reflect an automaticity deficit. Overall, the present data support the phonological theory of dyslexia, while acknowledging the presence of additional sensory and motor disorders in certain individuals."

Participants wereenrolled in five public schools in a moderately sizedsouthern American city (n = 197). We examined ifbeginning kindergarten levels of three kinds ofreading related abilities explained social classdifferences in growth of reading skills during thetime periods of beginning kindergarten to children'sfirst-, second-, third-, and fourth-grade years. Thereading related abilities were phonological awareness,rate of access to phonological information inlong-term memory, and print knowledge. We found thatthe reasons for social class differences in growth ofreading skills depended on the time interval that wasconsidered. During the earliest time interval, socialclass differences in growth of decoding skills werecompletely accounted for by performance on the controlmeasures of general verbal intelligence and prior wordreading skills. During the remaining time periods,social class differences in growth of decoding andreading comprehension skills persisted whenperformance on the three kinds of reading relatedabilities and the control measures were accounted for. The greatest attenuation of SES differences in growthof reading skills occurred when beginning kindergartenlevels of print knowledge were taken into account."
1,1977997278,the utility and accuracy of oral reading fluency score types in predicting reading comprehension,2011,"yaacov petscher, youngsuk kim",journal of school psychology,1,81,35,"This study used data from the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS; Good & Kaminski, 2002) oral reading fluency (ORF) probes to examine variation among different ORF score types (i.e., the median of three passages, the mean of all three passages, the mean of passages 2 and 3, and the score from passage 3) in predicting reading comprehension as a function of student reading fluency level and to compare the screening accuracy of these score types in predicting student reading comprehension. The results revealed that the relation between oral reading fluency and reading comprehension varied as a function of students' oral reading fluency and that different score types had varying predictive validity for year-end reading comprehension. The mean of all three passages demonstrated a marginally better balance in screening efficiency from September to December of grade one (especially for low-performing students), whereas in grades two and three, the median score was the best predictor. Furthermore, across all grades, increasing reading rates were observed for the three administered passages within an assessment period. The observed patterns mimicked previous experimental studies (Francis et al., 2008; Jenkins, Graff, & Miglioretti, 2009), suggesting that practice effects are an important consideration in the administration of multiple passages assessing oral reading fluency."

This study describes quantile regression, which provides estimates of the relations between the predictor(s) and outcome, but across multiple points of the outcome's distribution. Using data from the High School and Beyond and U.S. Sustained Effects Study databases, quantile regression is demonstrated and contrasted with linear regression when considering models with: (a) one continuous predictor, (b) one dichotomous predictor, (c) a continuous and a dichotomous predictor, and (d) a longitudinal application. Results from each example exhibited the differential inferences which may be drawn using linear or quantile regression."
1,2000381842,the role of sentence recall in reading and language skills of children with learning difficulties,2005,"tracy packiam alloway, susan e gathercole",learning and individual differences,1,56,59,"The present study explores the relationship between sentence recall and reading and language skills in a group of 7–11-year-old children with learning difficulties. While recent studies have found that performance on sentence recall tasks plays a role in learning, it is possible that this contribution is a reflection of shared resources with working memory. In order to investigate whether sentence recall was uniquely associated with reading and language skills, differences associated with IQ and working memory capacity were statistically controlled. A sample of 72 children was tested on measures of verbal complex memory, verbal short-term memory, sentence recall, expressive vocabulary, verbal and performance IQ, reading and language skills. Both sentence recall and verbal complex memory shared unique links with reading skill, and sentence recall was uniquely associated with language skills. This finding indicates that resources in long-term memory also play an important diagnostic role in reading and language abilities. The implications for educational practice are discussed."

We compared word, pseudoword, and text reading speed and accuracy, rapid naming (RAN) and phonological processing between poor readers (n = 80) and normally developing readers (n = 189). Reading problems were manifested in reading speed and in timed pseudoword reading accuracy. RAN predicted speed, and phonological processing predicted accuracy of reading in both groups. Among poor readers, RAN also explained reading accuracy. For the normally developing sample, phonological processing also predicted reading speed."
1,2024915811,reconsidering ses and gender divides in literacy achievement are the gaps across social class and gender necessary,2011,"tarja raag, karen kusiak, meredith e tumilty, anna kelemen, hilana bernheimer, jessica bond",educational psychology,1,9,21,"This study evaluated factors within families that enhance kindergarten reading readiness of children and are also linked to maternal education (a common proxy for SES). We were interested in identifying factors that would be more accessible to families and school administrators as sources of potential change than broad and un-malleable reflections of socio-economic status. Consistent with current research, we found that maternal education had a broad impact on the reading readiness of children. Maternal education was linked to the amount of time children spent with non-literary media (television, computers, videos, video games). Re-running analyses using time with media as a covariate resulted in reduced differences in reading outcomes of children as a function of maternal education. Effects of maternal education were reduced by the end of the kindergarten year, indicating that literacy programming implemented by the school was successful in closing this academic gap."

Through the application presented here, quantile regression is able to assess the genetic and environmental etiology of any skill or ability, at multiple points in the distribution of that skill or ability. This method is compared to the Cherny et al. (Behav Genet 22:153–162, 1992) method in an application to four different reading-related outcomes in 304 pairs of first-grade same sex twins enrolled in the Western Reserve Reading Project. Findings across the two methods were similar; both indicated some variation across the distribution of the genetic and shared environmental influences on non-word reading. However, quantile regression provides more details about the location and size of the measured effect. Applications of the technique are discussed."

The success of RTI rests in part on the accuracy of universal screening tools used within this framework. Despite advancements, screening instruments designed to identify children at risk for reading disabilities continue to have limited predictive validity. In this study, the authors examined a common screening instrument for the presence of floor effects and investigated the impact that these effects have on the predictive validity of the instrument. Longitudinal data (kindergarten to third grade) from a large cohort of children were used. These data included children's performance on five measures from the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) and two reading achievement outcome measures. The results showed that DIBELS measures were characterized by floor effects in their initial administrations and that these effects reduced the predictive validity of the measure..."

While home literacy activities and access to literacy materials have been associated with positive reading outcomes for urban and suburban students, little is known about home literacy environments of rural early elementary school students living in poverty and their relationship to foundational reading skills for struggling and nonstruggling readers. This study examined how home literacy environments might relate to rural kindergarten and first grade students’ reading performance. Parents of 1,108 kindergarten and first grade students in the rural Southeast completed questionnaires on the frequency of home literacy activities and access to literacy materials. Multilevel model analyses revealed that home literacy activities and access to literacy materials were positively related to basic word reading skills, passage comprehension, and spelling. Implications for families and educators are discussed."

Results demonstrated emergent dimensionality of language across development with distinct factors of vocabulary, grammar, and discourse skills by third grade, confirming that discourse skills are an important source of variance in children’s language ability and represent an important additional dimension to be accounted for in studying growth in language skills over the course of childhood."
