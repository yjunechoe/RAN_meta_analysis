Knowledge of and active application of specific reading strategies are also helpful to maximize reading comprehension (Snow et al., 1998), but most of the variability among children and adults in comprehension of written material can be accounted for by measuring the two broad families of skills identified in Gough‚Äôs simple view of reading (Gough, 1996; Hoover & Gough, 1990).

Moreover, the letter-sound knowledge level in kindergartners and first graders was consistently highest for letter sounds related to CV letter names, intermediate for letter sounds related to VC letter names, and lowest for letter sounds unrelated to letter names (McBride-Chang, 1999; Treiman et al., 1998; Treiman et al., 1994)."

When children‚Äôs patterns of alphabet acquisition are examined, a letter name structure effect is apparent: letter names and sounds are most likely to be known for letters that include cues to their sounds as opposed to letters with unrelated names and sounds (Justice et al., 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999; Piasta, 2006; Treiman et al., 1998)."

Considerable evidence also suggests reciprocal relations between phonological skills and alphabet knowledge development (Burgess & Lonigan, 1998; Lonigan, Burgess, & Anthony, 2000; McBride-Chang, 1999; Wagner et al., 1994), including potential benefits of phonological training on alphabet skills (Ball & Blachman, 1991).
Effects tended to be larger (moderate effect sizes) and more aligned with the NELP findings when multicomponential instruction was provided, perhaps lending support to notions of reciprocal relations among emergent literacy skills (Burgess & Lonigan, 1998; Lonigan et al., 2000; McBride-Chang, 1999; NICHD, 2000; Wagner et al., 1994).
Letter name and letter sound knowledge predict subsequent literacy skills independently of other important predictors including phonological awareness and oral language (Burgess & Lonigan, 1998; McBride-Chang, 1999; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994).
This result lends causal support to the argument for letter name-to-sound facilitation, discussed within the context of letter names that provide cues for learning letter sounds (Evans et al., 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999; Share, 2004; Treiman, Tincoff, & Richmond-Welty, 1996; Treiman et al., 1998)."

Across a large body of research, scientists have shown that alphabetic knowledge (letter-name and letter-sound knowledge) and phonological awareness (PA) are critical for students‚Äô reading acquisition in languages with alphabetic orthographies (Adams, 1990; Ehri, 1998; Kim, 2009; Levin, Shatil-Carmon, & Asif-Rave, 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999; Muter, Hulme, Snowling, & Stevenson, 2004; Schatschneider, Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, & Foorman, 2004; Storch & Whitehurst, 2002).
Letter names provide critical cues about letter sounds (McBride-Chang, 1999; Treiman & Kessler, 2003) that, in turn, are critical for word decoding.
Overall, the results of the present study suggest that children do take advantage of the iconicity in the learning of letter sounds (Foulin, 2005; McBride-Chang, 1999; Share, 2004; Treiman et al., 1999), and their sensitivity to sound structures in English does enhance probability of learning letter sounds."

Our finding that knowing a letter name is associated with the increased odds of knowing that letter sound by a large margin is not surprising, given the well-established relationship between letter-name knowledge and letter-sound knowledge (Evans et al., 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999).
Previous research suggests that letter sounds that are more closely connected to their names are easier to learn and more likely to be known at an earlier age (CardosoMartins, Mesquita, & Ehri, 2011; Evans et al., 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999; Piasta & Wagner, 2010b; Share, 2004; Treiman & Broderick, 1998; Treiman et al., 1998).

As mentioned earlier, phonemic awareness develops in tandem with orthographic instruction, which focuses on letters and sound-symbol correspondences (Adams, 1990).
Knowledge of letter names may enable children to read better because letter names are often similar to letter sounds, which facilitate nonword decoding (Adams, 1990, Treiman, Tincoff, & Richmond-Welty, 1996). Treiman et al. (1996) observed that young children were better able to supply the first letter for words such as beach or bead that begin with the same sounds as the letter name b than they were for words such as bail that do not.
Office of Education (see Adams, 1990) and conducted by Chall (1967) and Bond and Dykstra (1967) revealed that knowledge of letter names was the most significant predictor of beginning reading success for children.

In contrast, phonics is the system in which letters and graphemes represent sounds in an alphabetic-phonic language (Adams, 1990).
It has been defined as the ability to notice, think about, and work with the individual sounds in spoken words (Adams, 1990; Center for the Improvement of Early Reading Achievement, 2001).

Moreover, some education professionals contend that a combination of the two approaches is the best method of teaching the skill of reading (Adams, 1990). Slavin (1989) described these shifts of reading instruction as a swinging pendulum.
Researchers such as Chall (1967) and Adams (1990) have found that young children who are read to on a regular basis are exposed to the sounds of the language.
Success in decoding in one out of five children depended on explicit phonemic awareness instruction (Adams, 1990).
The opposing view held that teaching skills that enabled children to recognize written words should be the framework for early reading instruction (Adams, 1990.) According to Robinson and Clegg (1998), terms such as language experience, phonics, basal readers, and whole language have been linked to trends over time."

Furthermore, systematic phonics instruction has demonstrated reliably positive impacts on word decoding and word identification (Berninger, Abbott, Verneulen, Ogier, Brooksher, & Zook et al., 2002; Denton et al., 2006; Torgesen, 2000) In relation to early reading achievement, the meta analysis done by the NRP (2000) demonstrates the fact that systematic phonics instruction had the greatest effects for students in Kindergarten (d = 0.
Conversely poor readers are at increased risk for lifelong problems which may include delinquency, school-based behavioral problems, school avoidance/truancy, and limited future employment opportunities (Adams, 1990; Juel, 1996; Lyon, 1998; Riley, 1996; McGill-Frazen, 1987).
Systematic phonics instruction is shown to be successful in teaching the relationships between sounds and letters (Foorman et al., 2003; Foorman, & Torgesen, 2001; Adams, 1990).
The accuracy and rate at which a student can identify letters is important in the development of reading because it leads to the automatic association of letters with corresponding sounds, which is encompassed in the alphabetic principle (Hudson, et. al, 2009; Adams, 1990).
The underlying construct of the alphabetic principle is that letters of the alphabet (graphemes) represent corresponding sounds (phonemes) of spoken language, and that letter sound relationships can be incorporated to read real words, as well as to nonsense words (Adams, 1990; Foorman, Francis, Shaywitz, Shaywitz, & Fletcher, 1997; NRP, 2000; Torgesen, 2000).
Understanding the relationship between sounds (phonemes) and letters (graphemes) is at the center of the alphabetic principle, and without this knowledge, one cannot successfully master the skill of reading (Adams, 1990; Ehri, 1998; Hudson, 2009; NRP, 2000)."
1591354983,beginning to read thinking and learning about print,marilyn jager adams,1991,1544993446,"Adams (1990) argued that at school entry, knowledge of letter names is the strongest predictor of later reading ability.
An estimated one in three children experiences problems in learning to read (Adams, 1990).
It is clear, however, that letter knowledge is only one, among an array of emergent literacy skills, because teaching children the name of letters, solely, does not improve their reading ability (Adams, 1990).
Memorizing words gives the appearance of effective reading skills in the short-term but the skill of decoding is essential to reading novel words and reading success in the long-term (Adams, 1990; Ehri, 2005).
Research has demonstrated that phonological awareness strongly influences reading (Adams, 1990; Goswami & Bryant, 1990; Nation, 2008; Rack, Hulme, & Snowling, 1993; Wagner et al., 1997).
Some studies have linked the initiation of shared book reading and the frequency of shared book reading to family socio-economic status (Adams, 1990; Peralta de Mendoza, 1995; Raz & Bryant, 1990) but other studies have refuted this claim (Bus, van IJzendoorn, & Pellegrini, 1995).
The most effective programs provide explicit instruction in phonological awareness usually in combination with letter-sound training (Adams, 1990; Bus & van Uzendoorn, 1999)."

Naming speed is related to fluent reading, which is also associated with orthographic knowledge because recognition of letter patterns in a word depends on seeing these letters in sufficient temporal contiguity (Adams, 1990).
Phonological awareness (PA) refers to the ability to recognize that spoken words can be broken down into syllables, intra-syllabic units, and phonemes as well as the ability to talk about, reflect upon, and manipulate these components (Adams, 1990; Goswami & Bryant, 1990; Kirby et al., 2003; Wagner, Torgesen, Laughon, Simmons, & Rashotte, 1993).
These skills include phonological awareness, which refers to the ability to manipulate the sounds in words and the awareness of the sound structure of words, and phonological decoding, which enables the reader to convert written words into oral language by analyzing individual graphemes into their corresponding phonemes (Adams, 1990; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994).

Adams (1990), for example, suggests the following classification ranging from the easiest to the most difficult: - recognising familiar rhymes - recognising and classifying words into onset and rimes - syllable blending, or isolating the first sound of words - phoneme segmentation tasks - deletion or phoneme reversal to discover words.
It is agreed that letters are key to constructing the alphabetic principle (Adams, 1990; Ehri, 1993).
Letter knowledge is one of the most significant predictors of success in reading and writing, which together with phonological awareness is crucial in the acquisition of the alphabet principle (Adams, 1990; Bloodgood, 1999; Lonigan, Burgess & Anthony, 2000).

This result is not in line with research in English, where it has been found that rhyme awareness is reached by the end of kindergarten and that some rhyme tasks are too easy for first-grade children (Adams, 1990; Chard & Dickson, 1999).
c) After these foundational and basic phases, children advance to a consolidated alphabetic phase, which is the stage at which they are able to read and decode chunks of letters, such as rhymes, syllables, and morphemes to identify words, ideally by correspondence to morphemic units (Adams, 1990; Duncan, Seymour & Hill, 2000; Duncan & Seymour, 2003; Frith, 1985; Tafa & Manolitsis, 2008)."

Confirming findings from other studies (Kirtley et al., 1989; Treiman, 1985; Treiman & Weatherstone, 1992), Stahl and Murray (1994) found that the onset-rime level was the easiest to segment, whereas the most difficult levels were onset clusters (CC in CCVC words) and cluster codas (CC in CVCC words).
Four primary studies and one secondary source study 'suggested additional explanations for the differential difficulty of onset-rime and phoneme level tasks (Bowey & Francis, 1991; Kirtley et al., 1989; Treiman, 1985; Treiman & Zukowski, 1991).
In contrast, phonemic awareness appears dependent upon concurrent acquisition of alphabetic understanding (Bowey, 1994; Bowey & Francis, 1991; Kirtley et al., 1989; Stanovich, 1994).

In several studies, children with LD have more socio-emotional and behavioral difficulties; however, compared to control groups, children with NVLD, or both nonverbal and verbal disabilities, seem to be at greater risk (Badian, 1992; Dimitrovsky, et. al., 1998).

A longitudinal study (Nathan et al., 2004) of the relationship among early speech, language, and literacy skills in children from 4 to 7 years revealed that speech sound production skill did not account for variation in literacy outcomes once the effects of phoneme awareness were controlled.
Furthermore, speech therapy may also include varying levels of phonological awareness instruction, which also may influence the outcome of an experiment by minimizing negative literacy outcomes (Bird et al., 1995; Nathan et al., 2004; Rvachew, Chiang, & Evans, 2007).
Nathan et al. (2004) reported that persistence of preschool speech difficulty appeared to be a unique predictor of spelling (but not reading) for children at age 6;9 with a history of speech impairment.

1975998563,what is phonological awareness,catherine mcbridechang,1995,1544993446,"A wide variety of tasks have been designed to measure phonological awareness (McBride-Chang, 1995).
Based on growing evidence, most researchers would now support the reciprocal model of the phonological awareness-reading ability relationship (e.g. Castles & Coltheart, 2004; Fuchs et al., 2001; Hogan, Catts, and Little, 2005; McBride-Chang, 1995; Nation, 2008; Stanovich, 1986; Wagner et al., 1997).
Evidence suggests that phonological awareness and word reading are bi-directionally related such that ability to read words helps children recognize and understand the phonological components (Hogan, Catts, & Little, 2005; McBride-Chang, 1995; Stanovich, 1986).
Speech perception is necessary to hear the differences between sounds in speech and short term memory is required to store the speech sounds until cognitive processing (McBride-Chang, 1995; McBride-Chang et al., 1997).
This is consistent with current views of the bi-directional relationship between phonological awareness and word reading (Hogan, Catts, & Little, 2005; McBride-Chang, 1995; Perfetti, 1985; Stanovich, 1986).
This would be consistent with the hypothesis that the relationship between phonological awareness and word reading is bi-directional (McBride-Chang, 1995; Perfetti, 1985; Stanovich, 1986; Wagner et al., 1997) which suggests that greater word reading ability may help children 'pick-up' or notice the phonological structure of words more easily.

Examples of scaffolding involve using words that begin with continuants at the time of initial instruction in new tasks and introducing single phonemes prior to phoneme clusters (Caravolas & Bruck, 1993; Gonzalez & Garcia, 1995; McBride-Chang, 1995; Stahl & Murray, 1994; Treiman, 1985; Treiman & Weatherstone, 1992).
For example, scaffolding involves using words that begin with continuants at the time of initial instruction in new tasks and leaving clusters until tasks are familiar and partially mastered (Caravolas & Bruck, 1993; Gonzalez & Garcia, 1995; McBride-Chang, 1995; Stahl & Murray, 1994; Treiman, 1985; Treiman & Weatherstone, 1992).
In addition, a fourth study (McBride-Chang, 1995) supported the differential effect that linguistic features of words contribute to complexity.
One secondary source (Treiman & Zukowski, 1991), and eight primary studies provide delineation of linguistic complexity features and their interaction with student performance (Bowey & Francis, 1991; Caravolas & Bruck, 1993; Gonzalez & Garcia, 1995; Kirtley et al., 1989; McBride-Chang, 1995; Stahl & Murray, 1994; Treiman, 1985; Treiman & Weatherstone, 1992).

Letter knowledge is supposed to affect the origin and development of phonological awareness (Bowey, 1994), being the initial bridge for children to learn the alphabetic principle and grapheme- phoneme conversion (Riley, 1999; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998).
Several studies have supported significant correlations between phonological awarenees and vocabulary (Bowey, 1994; Burgess & Lonigan, 1998; Chaney, 1992; Wagner et al., 1994).
Specifically, letter knowledge contributes to the origin and development of phonological sensitivity (Bowey, 1994), providing the necessary knowledge for transforming graphemes into phonemes (Borzone de Manrique, 1994;"

Four primary studies and one secondary source study 'suggested additional explanations for the differential difficulty of onset-rime and phoneme level tasks (Bowey & Francis, 1991; Kirtley et al., 1989; Treiman, 1985; Treiman & Zukowski, 1991). Treiman (1985) explained that onset-rime units are more accessible than phonemes because they are cohesive units that function as real psychological units.
In contrast, phonemic awareness appears dependent upon concurrent acquisition of alphabetic understanding (Bowey, 1994; Bowey & Francis, 1991; Kirtley et al., 1989; Stanovich, 1994).
The purpose of the dissertation was to extend current knowledge on how to teach phonological awareness by addressing the following question: Is it more efficient and effective to teach onset-rime segmentation as a precursor to teaching phonemic segmentation than to teach phonemic segmentation directly?

In other words, is specific meta-linguistic ability required to use contextual facilitation that helps with establishing sound-letter rules? Bowey & Patel (1988) addressed this question.

First, RAN is closely connected with reading fluency (Kirby et al., 2010; Norton & Wolf, 2012), which makes it one of the prerequisites of reading fluency.
However, the research evidence thus far has shown the strongest support for a connection between RAN and reading fluency (often defined as speed of accurate response to oral reading tasks) or reading speed, as the evidence on the connections with other aspects of reading or spelling have been more or less conflicting (for reviews, see Georgiou & Parrila, 2013; Kirby et al., 2010; Norton & Wolf, 2012).
RAN predicted reading skills independently of phonological awareness, and was uniquely associated with reading speed, which is in line with the DDH and several results from studies investigating various orthographies (Wolf & Bowers, 1999; for reviews, see Georgiou & Parrila, 2013; Kirby et al., 2010; Norton & Wolf, 2012).
These results are in line with those of previous studies in which the DDH has been supported in various orthographies (for the most recent reviews, see Georgiou & Parrila, 2013; Kirby et al., 2010; Norton & Wolf, 2012) and separate roles indicated for RAN and phonological awareness in predicting literacy skills (Compton et al."

Selection was necessary to ensure that the poor readers did indeed have difficulty with /ba/‚Äì/da/ TOJ, because both Tallal (1980) and Reed (1989) found poor readers whose TOJ performance fell within the normal range.
To be sure, Reed (1989), the only researcher to have tested specifically reading-impaired children on both speech and nonspeech tasks in the Tallal paradigm, did find that such children performed significantly worse than normal controls on TOJ for both brief tones and stop consonants.
Values of the stimulus parameters were identical to those used by Reed (1989) in her successful replication of Tallal‚Äôs experiments (Tallal, 1980; Tallal & Stark, 1981).
Yet the poor readers did display precisely the difficulties with /ba/‚Äì/da/ TOJ that Tallal (1980) proposed as symptomatic of a phonological disorder and that Reed (1989) subsequently observed in some reading-impaired children."

The provision of further detailed information about these cross-population similarities and differences in language profiles and documentation of subtypes within populations would enhance clinicians‚Äô ability to identify young children who are likely to develop clinically significant language-learning problems and would enhance clinicians‚Äô understanding of the different levels of risk that may predispose very young children for persistent language impairment (Thal et al., 2004).
Within-group variation in language and associated cognitive and behavioral skills is a hallmark feature of many clinical groups of children with delayed or disordered development (Kennedy et al., 1991; Lord et al., 2004; Mervis, 2003; Tager-Flusberg, 2004a; Thal et al., 2004; Tomblin, Zhang, Weiss, Catts, & Weismer, 2004), yet the primary focus in many prior comparative studies has been on describing average group differences in language performance, which can obscure within-group variations."

Though definitive studies have not been conducted, there are a number of investigations showing that individuals selected on the basis of the exclusionary criteria given above are indeed substantially deficient in decoding skill (Doehring, Trites, Patel, and Fiedorowicz 1981; Seymour and Porpodas 1980; Snowling 1980; Vellutino 1979)."

This theoretical argument leads me to support those theorists who have emphasized processing failures at the word level in the understand ing of reading disability (Gough and Hillinger 1980; Morrison and Manis 1982; Shankweiler and Liberman 1972; Vellutino 1979)."

Calfee's (1977) concept of a ""clean"" psychological test: the idea that before a deficit in a specific processing operation is hypothesized, investigators should insure that the tasks employed isolate (as much as is feasible) that particular process without heavily involving other cognitive processes that could contaminate the inference of a specific processing deficit (see also, Stanovich 1978; Torgesen 1975, 1979; Vellutino 1979).
Finally, although it was previously thought that the phonological analysis deficits revealed in the studies reviewed above were due to problems in becoming consciously aware of phoneme units rather than in basic speech discrimination processes (see Groff 1975; Vellutino 1979; Wallach et al. 1977), recent evidence may lead to a qualification of this conclusion.
Indeed, there is now a strong consensus in the reading literature on this point (Barron 1981; Bateman 1979; Chali 1979; Gough 1981; Gough and Hillinger 1980; Juel 1983; Liberman 1982; Mitchell 1982; Perfetti and Roth 1981; Samuels 1979; Stanovich 1980, 1982a, 1982b; Vellutino 1979).
It is generally accepted that visual perception training programs have been ineffec tive in promoting reading acquisition (Bateman 1979; Coles 1978; Hammill and Larsen 1974,1978; Kavale and Mattson 1983; Larsen and Hammill 1975; Larsen, Parker, and Hammill 1982; Vellutino 1979).

And certainly there are many studies that are strongly suggestive of a causal connection (Fox & Routh, 1984; Lundberg et al., 1988; Schneider et al., 1997; Treiman & Baron, 1983).
In contrast to these less conclusive findings, there are several reports of successful transfer of phonemic awareness training to reading-related measures, with significant group differences being found between treatment and control conditions (Cunningham, 1990; Fox & Routh, 1984; Kozminsky & Kozminsky, 1995; Lie, 1991; Lundberg et al., 1988; Schneider et al., 1997; Study 2; Treiman & Baron, 1983).

Although deficiencies in one or more language domains is part of the profile of DLD, vocabulary and grammar in particular contribute significantly to reading outcomes in children in this population (Catts et al., 2002; Snowling et al., 2000; Bishop & Adams, 1990, Scarborough & Dobrich, 1990).
Although there is increased risk for reading problems, considerable variability in both language and reading performance is reported by several researchers, particularly in the early phase of reading (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Catts, 1993; Catts et al., 2002; McArthur et al., 2000; Share & Leikin, 2004; Snowling et al., 2000; Stothard et al., 1998).
Children identified in kindergarten as language impaired performed significantly lower on word attack and word identification in second and fourth grade than did the non-impaired control children (Catts et al., 2002).
Children may then be grouped on the basis of language subtypes such as receptive or expressive involvement (Simkin & ContiRamsden, 2006), or on the basis of intellectual functioning (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Catts et al., 2002; Snowling et al., 2000).
In many studies, correlation analyses and multiple language measures combining both areas into a composite score are often used, making it difficult to determine the effect of a specific domain on reading outcomes (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Catts, 1993; Catts et al., 2002; Share & Leiken, 2004; Wise et al., 2007).
Other studies administer screening assessments to a larger sample of children to identify children whose language performance is below 1 standard deviation (SD) of the mean (Catts et al., 2002; Share & Leikin, 2004; Simkin & Conti-Ramsden, 2006).
Some researchers speculate that grammar plays a more important role in predicting reading outcomes than other aspects of language (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Catts et al., 2002).
Some studies examine a broader range of language function, including measures spontaneous speech or narrative abilities (Catts et al., 2002) or phonological awareness (Share & Leikin, 2004; Catts et al.

The result that a vast majority of the children with RD were characterized by deficits in RAN, phonological awareness, or both for the most part supported the DDH (Wolf & Bowers, 1999) and also gave indirect support for the multiple deficit model of developmental disorders (Pennington, 2006), although, to throw further light on the precursors of learning difficulties, more potential predictors should be included."

A further important finding from Pennington and LeFly‚Äôs (2001) study was that FR-not dyslexic children exhibited mild impairment on early implicit and explicit phonological measures at kindergarten age and on literacy measures at the end of Grade 2.
In line with Pennington‚Äôs (2006) multiple risk model, an important focus for research in developmental disorders is to identify specific genetic and environmental risk factors in order to understand how they interact to influence the development of phenotypic traits.
In line with the multiple deficits model (Pennington, 2006), it is likely that children who go on to develop dyslexia inherit a combination of genetic risk factors from parents.

Pennington (2006) has argued for a move away from simple single-deficit cognitive models of developmental disorders towards multiple deficit models, in which the presentation of cognitive profiles and/or behavioural symptoms consistent with a given disorder is dependent on a host of genetic and environmental factors, which operate multifactorially and probabilistically (Figure 2.

The fact that weaknesses in the FR-not dyslexic group were not observed by Scarborough (1990) may be attributable to the small number of children in this sample, the younger age at which their cognitive skills were assessed, and/or the use of naturalistic language samples, as opposed to standardised tests in
standardised scores of 80 or less on two of three reading tests in Pennington & LeFly (2001) as opposed to 1."

As reported in previous studies (Korat et al., 2007), the existence of literacy tools at home, including the age of starting to read to the child, was correlated positively and significantly with the SES of the families.
Following previous research on these relationship among Hebrew-speaking children (Korat et al., 2007), we assumed that children‚Äôs background variables, such as SES and HLE, would make a greater contribution to the children‚Äôs literacy level than maternal mediation.
For example, 41% of the behavior of low SES Israeli Hebrew-speaking mothers (Korat et al., 2007) in the reading event with their young child is a discussion beyond the text, while among middle SES it is 50%.
Furthermore, researchers have reported differences in the maternal quality of mediation in book reading between low SES (LSES) and middle SES (MSES) families, favoring the latter (Baker et al., 2001; Heath, 1983; Korat et al., 2007; Leseman & de Jong, 1998; Ninio, 1980).
Moreover, LSES mothers tend to relate more to illustrations in the book and to paraphrase the text to their children (low level of cognitive mediation), whereas MSES mothers discuss the story content with their children, use a rich vocabulary, complex language, and relate to the written text (high level of cognitive mediation) (Korat et al., 2007).
Research conducted in Israel (Aram & Levin, 2002; Korat et al., 2007) and in other countries (Walker, Greenwood, Hart, & Carta, 1994) indicates a connection between family SES and children‚Äôs achievements in spoken and written language.
The results are similar to previous studies regarding the contribution of SES and HLE to children‚Äôs early literacy in low SES communities (Evans, Shaw, & Bell, 2000; Korat et al., 2007).
There is evidence that this activity contributes to children‚Äôs spoken language in kindergarten (Bus, Van Ijzendoorn, & Pellegrini, 1995; Cunningham, 2010; Justice & Ezell, 2000), to early literacy (Aram & Biron, 2004; Cunningham, 2010; De Temple & Snow, 2003; Korat et al., 2007; S√©n√©chal & Lefevre, 2002), and to the acquisition of reading in school (Baker, Mackler, Sonnenschein, & Serpell, 2001; Mol, Bus, De Jong, & Smeets, 2008).
Why do Arabic-speaking mothers tend to read the text and paraphrase during most of their reading event time and discuss the story to a much smaller extent? For example, low SES Israeli Hebrew-speaking mothers (Korat et al., 2007) exhibit paraphrasing in only 32% of their behavior while middle SES show 22%."

Based on this theoretical framework of learning induced plasticity, initial studies in children employing a precursor of what is now a commercial program called ‚Äò‚ÄòFast ForWord ‚Äù (FFW) revealed that targeted training of rapidly changing transitions in speech affected auditory processing thresholds and improved receptive language in languagelearning impaired (LLI) children (Merzenich et al., 1996; Tallal et al., 1996).
Consistent with the reports by Tallal and colleagues (Tallal et al., 1996), the FFW group made gains in spoken language and syntax immediately after intervention; however, comparison with the control group at the end of the study revealed that the gains failed to maintain at the two-year follow-up, demonstrating no long term benefits of FFW.
Initially, strong positive results were reported by Tallal, Merzenich and colleagues based on laboratory studies involving young children (Merzenich et al., 1996; Tallal et al., 1996).
Our results fail to support claims that FFW has a specific beneficial effect on language skills (Merzenich et al., 1996; Tallal et al., 1996) and reading performance (Temple et al.

The degree of their difficulty in nonword repetition tasks has led to investigations of nonword repetition as a possible marker of SLI that can be used to identify impaired children (Bishop et al., 1996; ContiRamsden, Botting, & Faragher, 2001; Conti-Ramsden & Hesketh, 2003; Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998).
The result is also consistent with the lasting nonword repetition deficits seen in children with resolved language impairments (Bishop et al., 1996).
There has been considerable debate surrounding the nature of the skills tapped in nonword repetition, whether it recruits phonological working memory (Bishop et al., 1996;Botting&Conti-Ramsden, 2001;Montgomery, 1995b; Van der Lely & Howard, 1993), phonological encoding (Kamhi & Catts, 1986), phonological awareness or sensitivity (e."

Fifth, most of the previous research has been conducted in orthographically opaque languages, such as English (Evans et al., 2000; Frijters et al., 2000; Hood et al., 2008; S√©n√©chal et al., 1998), and only a few studies have examined children learning to read in orthographically transparent language, such as Finnish (Silinskas, Lepp√§nen, et al.
Fourth, only a few studies have included children from different school grades, allowing the possibility to investigate whether school grade moderates the association between parents‚Äô teaching and children's skills (Green et al., 2007; Hood et al., 2008; Levin et al., 1997; Silinskas, Lepp√§nen, et al., 2010).
Other studies have also used similar items (e.g., Foy & Mann, 2003; Haney & Hill, 2004; Hood et al., 2008; Lepp√§nen et al., 2004; Silinskas, Lepp√§nen, et al., 2010).
The reason for this was that such skills can be assumed to be associated with the frequency of parents‚Äô reading-related activities (Hood et al., 2008; Manolitsis et al., 2009; S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002; Silinskas, Lepp√§nen, et al., 2010; Torppa et al., 2006).
This is a new finding, since in the previous studies gender differences were either not found (Hood et al., 2008) or were not examined (Evans et al.
We further assumed that shared reading would not predict children's word reading skills, because shared reading is related to children's vocabulary rather than to written language skills (Hood et al., 2008; S√©n√©chal et al., 1998).
and formal reading-related activities at home may occur simultaneously, they have been shown to be relatively independent (Hood et al., 2008; Manolitsis, Georgiou, Stephenson, & Parrila, 2009; S√©n√©chal, LeFevre, Thomas, & Daley, 1998)."

However, if higherorder skills also come into play in the early stages of reading acquisition (Catts et al., 1999; Kendeou et al., 2009a, 2009b; NICHD, 2005), oral-comprehension skills measured at age 4 can be predicted to explain a significant part of the variance in early reading, especially when reading comprehension is considered.
Moreover, there is growing evidence that oral-language skills, not just code skills, come into play early in the course of reading acquisition (Catts et al., 1999; Catts, Hogan & Adolf, 2005; Kendeou et al., 2009b; Nation, 2009; NICHD, 2005).
Our results are consistent with the theoretical claim of continuity between overall oral-language development and reading acquisition, which posits that code skills, while crucial at the beginning of the reading process, also interact with other broader language skills at a very early stage (Catts et al., 1999; Catts et al., 2005; Dickinson et al., 2003; Duff et al., 2009; Nation, 2005; NICHD, 2005; Scarborough, 2005; Snowling, 2005).
Significant high correlations are usually obtained between different language abilities during the preschool years (Bianco et al., 2010; Catts et al., 1999; Kendeou et al., 2009b; Scarborough, 2001).
They have found (1) that these oral skills have a direct impact on word identification in first grade (Catts et al., 1999; NICHD, 2005) and (2) that these measures predict the response to remedial reading programmes (Vadasy, Sanders & Abbott, 2008)."

Although significant improvement in phonological awareness and reading has been documented across several decades of intervention research, some children with low pretest scores in phonological awareness do not make progress in spite of instruction (Torgesen et al., 1992; Torgesen et al., 1994).
Because of the established causal relation to reading, it is important to identify early and intervene early in phonological awareness (Blachman, 1994; Lyon, 1995; Torgesen et al., 1994) 4.
Evidence suggested that retrieval processes,and awareness are independent (Torgesen et al., 1994) and that further research is needed to understand the relative independence of encoding to awareness and retrieval processes.
First, segmentation has a high correlation with beginning reading (Torgesen et al., 1994) and if developed as a prerequisite skill to reading increases the ease of reading acquisition (Smith et al.
However, conclusions from a single recent study did not offer full support for that notion by indicating that phonological awareness may not be as independent of intelligence as extant research has suggested (Torgesen et al., 1994).

However, knowledge of letter sounds and letter names is not completely overlapping (Blaiklock, 2004; Scarborough, 1998; Treiman et al., 1997; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994).
Previous studies confirm measures of language and language-based skills administered to kindergarten children are among the best predictors of reading achievement in later grades (Blaiklock, 2004; Butler et al., 1985; Scarborough, 1998; Share et al., 1984; Vellutino & Scanlon, 2001; Wood et al., 2005).
Research has clearly demonstrated the importance of phonemic awareness to reading ability and that early assessments of phonemic awareness are highly predictive of later reading achievement (Ball & Blachman, 1991; Blaiklock, 2004; Foorman et al., 1991; Foy & Mann, 2006; Mann, 1993; NICHD, 2000; Perfetti et al., 1987; Stahl & Murray, 1994).
Since letter name and letter sound knowledge develop at different rates, with different relationships with reading, Blaiklock (2004) recommended that studies consider both letter name and letter sound knowledge.
Studies of early literacy development routinely use word reading tests (Ball & Blachman, 1991; Blaiklock, 2004; Hatcher et al., 2006; Mann, 1993; Shatil et al., 2000).

Evidence for this approach comes also from studies that have found no correlation between rhyme and phoneme measures from early readers (Blaiklock, 2004).
Phoneme deletion tasks, which are often very challenging for young children, are subject to floor effects, and therefore, are best for measuring phonological awareness in children with some reading ability (Blaiklock, 2004; Schatschneider et al., 1999).
Rhyme matching, and blending onset and rhyme segments are tasks that appear to be most effective for measuring phonological awareness in very young children (Blaiklock, 2004).

Accordingly, virtually every recent review has judged that a language-based origin for reading disabilities is most consistent with available findings (e.g., Kamhi & Catts, 1989; Kavanagh & Yeni-Komshian, 1985; Perfetti, 1985; Stanovich, 1988; Vellutino, 1979).
Consequently, most contemporary views reject the notion that general language deficits are directly responsible for reading difficulties in favor of the hypothesis that a more specific deficit in phonological-or, more narrowly, in metaphonological-skill is the more likely proximal cause of poor reading achievement, at least in the early school years (e.g., Kamhi & Catts, 1989; Stanovich, 1988; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987).
The issue of specificity is further clouded by the possibility that the scope of impairment is likely to vary according to the criteria used to classify reading disabilities and is likely to broaden over time as a consequence of the cognitive, instructional, and motivational changes brought about by the child's reading difficulties (Stanovich, 1988)."

The general model of the Matthew Effect in education, suggests that children with 'advantageous early experiences' are able to benefit more from new educational experiences, resulting in large individual differences in educational outcomes (Stanovich, 1986; Walberg & Tsai, 1983).
The other category of unskilled readers were often called 'garden variety poor readers'; children who exhibited delays in both reading ability and intelligence (Goswami & Bryant, 1990; Stanovich, 1986).
This would be consistent with the hypothesis that the relationship between phonological awareness and word reading is bi-directional (McBride-Chang, 1995; Perfetti, 1985; Stanovich, 1986; Wagner et al., 1997) which suggests that greater word reading ability may help children 'pick-up' or notice the phonological structure of words more easily.

In sum, there are various candidate components for the Matthew effect model (Stanovich, 1986), but direct empirical evidence for the developmental model that is hypothesized to underlie the increase of individual differences in reading is scarce.
The Matthew effect model of Stanovich (1986) provides a theoretical framework in which the development of individual differences in reading ability can be described and explained.
The developmental trend toward word recognition supplemented by direct use of orthography suggests that the relationship between individual differences in phonological processing skills and phonological recoding skills is developmentally limited (Stanovich, 1986).
The model underlying the influence of the amount of exposure to print on individual differences in reading achievement is one of accelerating skill development by means of practice (Cipielewski & Stanovich, 1992; Stanovich, 1986).
The second mechanism describes the fact that individual differences in a particular cognitive process may be a causal determinant of variation in reading achievement early in development, but at some later point have no further effects on the level of reading efficiency (Stanovich, 1986).
The theoretical framework used to describe and explain the development of individual differences in reading ability was the Matthew effect model of Stanovich (1986).

Their test may be a more sensitive measure because it has 10 nonwords at each of four lengths (two to five syllables), whereas the CTOPP has only 18 pseudowords in total and only 10 between two and five syllables in length.

Tests of working memory, such as pseudoword repetition, appear at first glance to assess a general cognitive skill, but there is evidence that pseudoword repetition is influenced by knowledge of the language from which the pseudowords were derived (Gathercole, 1995; Thorn & Gathercole, 1999)."

Cross-language studies conducted in languages varying in orthographic consistency also demonstrate that although phonological awareness may be a common factor across languages, its ability to predict literacy levels varies with orthography (e.g., Everatt et al., 2010; Everatt, Smythe, Ocampo, & Gyarmathy, 2004; Georgiou, Parrila, & Liao, 2008; Seymour et al., 2003; Smythe et al., 2008).
However, the relationship between the written form and language varies across languages (Seymour et al., 2003; Ziegler & Goswami, 2005).
In fact, one of the reasons for caution here is that children learning a transparent orthography with a more consistent relationship between written symbols (letters/graphemes) and language sounds (phonemes) than that found in English seem to show faster progress in word-level literacy, and process language at the level of the phoneme earlier, than those learning a less regular orthography (Seymour et al., 2003).
In order to develop general theories of reading ‚Äì perhaps a universal model of reading ‚Äì it may be necessary to perform studies that do not focus solely on the English language/orthography (Seymour et al., 2003; Share, 2008; Ziegler et al., 2010).
Rates of improvement in reading, and literacy-related skills, may vary across different language cohorts (Seymour et al., 2003; Ziegler et al., 2010) meaning that different measures may be needed to identify difficulties in literacy acquisition.
Reading development seems to be a slower process in complex orthographies (Seymour et al., 2003).
Seymour et al. (2003) in their most ambitious crosslinguistic study, investigated letter knowledge, familiar word reading, and simple non-word reading of 14 orthographies and found that fundamental linguistic differences in syllabic complexity and orthographic depth are important in reading."

Learning letter knowledge per se does not seem to vary as a function of the regularity and complexity of the orthography (Seymour et al., 2003).
Length and regularity effects are significantly greater in shallower orthographies than in English (e.g., Ellis and Hooper, 2001; Seymour et al., 2003; Spencer and Hanley, 2003).
One of the most striking demonstrations of the influence of orthographic consistency comes from a cross-linguistic investigation in which reading performance on simple words and non-words was measured at the end of Grade 1 in 14 European countries (Seymour et al., 2003).
There is evidence that during the first years of schooling reading and spelling acquisition proceeds faster in readers of regular orthographies than in readers of English (Caravolas and Bruck, 1993; Seymour et al., 2003; Frith, Wimmer and Landerl, 1998; Naslund, 1999; Oney and Goldman, 1984) .

Support for the idea that letter name knowledge is used to acquire letter sound knowledge is provided by the letter name structure effect (e.g., Evans et al., 2006; Justice et al., 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999; Piasta, 2006; Treiman et al., 1998).
When children‚Äôs patterns of alphabet acquisition are examined, a letter name structure effect is apparent: letter names and sounds are most likely to be known for letters that include cues to their sounds as opposed to letters with unrelated names and sounds (Justice et al., 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999; Piasta, 2006; Treiman et al., 1998)."

005) was in the opposite direction as what might have been expected based on Justice et al.‚Äôs (2006) study of preschoolers using UC letters (OR = 1.
Although the most well-established influence on a child‚Äôs learning individual letters is the own-name advantage hypothesis (Justice et al., 2006), not much evidence supports the own-name advantage when the last name is considered.
Empirical studies have repeatedly demonstrated that preschoolers and kindergarteners are better able to recognize UC letters that appear as the first letter in their own name (Justice et al., 2006; Treiman & Broderick, 1998; Treiman et al., 2006).
No clear consensus currently exists as to how to approach teaching LC letter names as seen in various preschool curricula (Justice et al., 2006).
Other studies on US preschoolers have also found an increased probability, although to a lesser extent, of successful letter naming that extends to whether the letter is found in a child‚Äôs name, not just in the initial position (Justice et al., 2006; Treiman & Kessler, 2004; Treiman et al., 2006).
Our finding that reinforces the own-name advantage hypothesis is not surprising because the hypothesis has been supported by several other studies (e.g., Bloodgood, 1999; Justice et al., 2006; Levin & Aram, 2004; Treiman & Broderick, 1998; Treiman et al., 2006).
Previous research has shown that developmental aspects of language production influence the accurate naming of letter names, such that letters names that contain phonemes acquired earlier in speech production are also learned earlier (Justice et al., 2006).
We extend and refine prior research (Justice et al., 2006; Treiman & Kessler, 2003, 2004; Turnbull et al., 2010) that tested theories related to alphabet knowledge, and we focus on LC letter naming with kindergarteners using a much larger sample than previously tested.
While some curricula may focus on teaching the letters in alphabetical order, others may focus on frequently occurring letters or letters in the child‚Äôs name or may have no focus on specified order (Justice et al., 2006)."

Children tend to learn the names of the letters in their own names first, and this benefit may extend to the sounds associated with those letters (Clay, 1975; Justice et al., 2006; Treiman & Kessler, 2003; Treiman et al., 1998).
Children‚Äôs early literacy skills support the development of alphabet knowledge (Clay, 1975; Foy & Mann, 2006; Justice et al., 2006).
Our finding of a medium effect size for the first letter and sound of a child‚Äôs first name supports the own-name advantage hypothesis, expanding this finding, which has long been established in the realm of letter-name knowledge, to letter sounds as well (Clay, 1975; Justice et al., 2006; Treiman & Kessler, 2003; Treiman et al., 1998).
Several letter-name studies (Huang & Invernizzi, 2012; Justice et al., 2006; Turnbull et al., 2010) have also made use of the same letter corpus.
The relationship between the letter name and its sound, the relative difficulty of identifying and isolating a letter‚Äôs sound, and the number of sounds a letter can represent, are all factors that may make some letters more likely to be mastered earlier and some to be mastered later or require more explicit instruction (Evans et al., 2006; Huang & Invernizzi, 2012; Justice et al., 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999; Treiman et al., 1998).
While multilevel logistic regression modeling (or hierarchical generalized linear models [HGLM] with a binary outcome and a logit link function) has been used in several studies related to letter name identification (e.g., Huang & Invernizzi, 2012; Justice et al., 2006; Turnbull et al., 2010), we also considered another similar statistical model, a cross classified random effects model (CCREM; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) which has been used as well in other studies (e."

2073871158,trying to make sense of developmental language disorders,alan g kamhi,1998,2233397681,"An accurate description of the nature of the language and language-related strengths and weaknesses of children with SLI will eliminate the need to use nonverbal IQ or discrepancy formulae as criteria for group membership (Kamhi, 1998) thus reducing errors in detecting affected individuals; and to develop more accurate methods of determining genetic influence (Rice, Haney & Wexler, 1998).
At this point, the term SLI can be seen as a useful superordinate term (Kamhi, 1998) to describe children with developmental language disorders, who do not fit into other major etiological categories.
Children with SLI have been referred to as developmentally aphasic/ dysphasic, or language impaired/ disordered/ delayed/ disabled (Kamhi, 1998; Leonard, 1998).
In some instances, researchers have also tried to exclude language deficits resulting from sociocultural or environmental factors (Kamhi, 1998; Leonard, 1998).
Inclusionary Criterion: The most consistent inclusionary criterion is a clinical diagnosis of language disorder (Kamhi, 1998).
More recently, it has been suggested that a basic processing deficit could be used to distinguish children with intrinsic language disorders from those whose language impairments are caused primarily by extrinsic environmental factors (e.g. Spitz, Tallal, Flax & Benasich, 1997; Kamhi, 1998).
Specific Language Impairment 49 sensory deficits, severe emotional disturbances, detrimental environmental factors, or brain damage (Kamhi, 1998).
Specific Language Impairment 51 disabilities; emotional disturbance; mental retardation (developmental delay); and severe phonological disorders (Stark & Tallal, 1981a; Aram, Morris & Hall, 1993; Kamhi, 1998; Leonard, 1998).
The reliance on exclusionary criteria results in the identification of a heterogeneous group with varying degrees of expressive and receptive language problems, varying profiles of strengths and weaknesses, and marked differences in other areas of weakness (Stark & Tallal, 1981a; Leonard, 1987, 1998; Sloan, 1992; Aram, Morris & Hall, 1993; Kamhi, 1998; van der Lely & Christian, 2000).
The term language delay is still used by clinicians, but is not strictly accurate, since the term delay implies that these children will eventually ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù (Kamhi, 1998), while for many individuals SLI is known to persist into adolescence and adulthood (Leonard, 1998)."

Language-general linguistic knowledge such as phonological awareness might need to be acquired only once while acquiring L1 literacy, in contrast to other processes that might need to be acquired for each language (Durgunoglu, 2002).

According to the ‚ÄòDouble Deficit Hypothesis‚Äô, this skill is a second centre of deficit in dyslexia, which is different from PA, making a unique and independent contribution to explaining reading difficulties related to speed (Compton, 2000; de Jong & van der Leij, 1999; Manis, Seidenberg & Doi, 1999; Mann & Wimmer, 2002; Wagner et al., 1997).

As predicted by S√©n√©chal and LeFevre‚Äôs (2002) Home Literacy Model, the relationship of HLE variables with phonological awareness was wholly mediated by oral language and letter knowledge.
Contrary to hypotheses, S√©n√©chal et al. (2008) found that storybook exposure did not correlate with children‚Äôs narrative skills (researcher rated linguistic complexity, cohesion and story grammar in a story telling task).
For example, S√©n√©chal, Cornell and Broda (1995) made video recordings of 9-, 17- and 27-month-olds infants having six unfamiliar storybooks
However, S√©n√©chal, LeFevre, Smith-Chant and Colton (2001) made a strong argument that emergent literacy should be considered separately from oral language, on the basis that the two constructs are likely to have distinct ontogenies.

Since oral and written language skills combined predicted 20% of the variance in children‚Äôs end-of-year reading performance, S√©n√©chal et al. (1998) argued that the relationship between HLE and reading is mediated by proficiency in both oral and written language skills.

The authors cited the lack of attention paid by parents and children to text as evidence against shared reading in the early years being a crucial precursor to reading success, but if, as predicted by S√©n√©chal and LeFevre‚Äôs (2002) Home Literacy Model, storybook reading fosters oral language rather than code-related skills, these eye-tracking data are not unexpected.

It requires sustained parental support that involves implicit and explicit reading intervention (S√©n√©chal, 2006).
The Home Literacy Model developed from a five-year longitudinal study by S√©n√©chal and colleagues with white middle-class samples (S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal & LeFervre, 2001, 2002; S√©n√©chal et al., 2001; S√©n√©chal, LeFervre, Thomas & Colton, 1998).

Critically, these pathways are uncorrelated (S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002).
In one pathway, children‚Äôs exposure to shared reading with parents, known as informal experiences, correlates with vocabulary knowledge (S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002) and are indirectly associated (via a mediating association with vocabulary) with reading ability in Grade 2 (Hood, Conlon, & Andrews, 2008), Grade 3 (S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002), and Grade 4 (S√©n√©chal, 2006).
It is possible that across development, these pathways mediate or affect other mathematical developments (much as vocabulary mediated Grade 3 reading development in the home literacy model; S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002; see also LeFevre, Fast, et al., 2010).

We also assumed that the effects of early experiences would start to be measurable with the academic assessments roughly a year after parents‚Äô reports and would continue into the school years, following the trajectories outlined in other research (e.g., Huntsinger et al., 1998; LeFevre et al., 2009; S√©n√©chal, 2006)."

The Home Literacy Model proposed by S√©n√©chal and her colleagues (S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002) argues that home teaching has specific and direct effects on emergent literacy and literacy skills but not language skills because children‚Äôs attention is directed to print.
There is emerging support for this model on monolingual children learning to read in various orthographies (Hood et al., 2008; Manolitsis, Georgiou, & Parrila, 2011; S√©n√©chal, 2006).
Therefore, home teaching by parents promotes children‚Äôs emergent literacy skills including phonological awareness and letter name knowledge and, in the long run, enhances their literacy skills (Ebey, Marchand-Martella, Martella, & Nelson, 1999; Evans et al., 2000; S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002)."

Although previous studies have revealed much information about precise mechanisms for the relationship between home literacy practices and literacy development (for example, Foy & Mann, 2003; S√©n√©chal et al., 1998; S√©n√©chal, 2006a), these studies have been limited to cross-sectional examinations or prediction of changes from two data points using longitudinal data.
For instance, S√©n√©chal and her colleagues (1998) investigated how parent book reading and parent teaching are differentially related to
One of the home literacy activities that has received much theoretical and empirical attention is parental story book reading to children (Dickinson & Tabors, 2001; Ewers & Brownson, 1999; Jordan, Snow, & Porche, 2000; S√©n√©chal, LeFevre, Hudson, & Lawson, 1996; S√©n√©chal, LeFevre, Thomas, & Daley, 1998; S√©n√©chal, 2006a).
Previous studies with English-speaking families in the United States and French-speaking Canadian families demonstrated that shared book reading in particular can be a source of vocabulary learning (Ewers & Brownson, 1999; S√©n√©chal, 2006a) because children‚Äôs books in English tended to contain more rare, academic words than those found in television or conversations (Hayes & Ahrens, 1988).
The positive association of the frequency of home reading with children‚Äôs vocabulary, letter-name knowledge, and phonological awareness confirms that children‚Äôs exposure to and experiences with print may enhance these important language and emergent literacy skills (S√©n√©chal, 2006a).
These results differ from previous findings with Englishspeaking and French-speaking families (Evans, Shaw, & Bell, 2000; S√©n√©chal 2006a; S√©n√©chal et al., 1998) and from the results of a meta-analysis of home teaching intervention
These two dimensions also have been identified from Englishfamilies (S√©n√©chal, 2006a; S√©n√©chal et al., 1998; Teale, 1986) although these previous studies reported that home teaching and parent reading were not related (S√©n√©chal, 2006a; S√©n√©chal et al.

Interestingly, storybook reading was associated with receptive language (S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002; S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal et al., 2008; Hood et al., 2008), but receptive language skills and emergent literacy skills were not directly related.
It is necessary to narrow the focus of the research to include specific literacy skills in order to pinpoint the affect of storybook exposure and parent teaching on each area (S√©n√©chal, 2006).
Parent teaching is related, however, to phoneme awareness in the emergent reader (S√©n√©chal, 2006).
Previous results were obtained with English- or French-speaking children (S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002; S√©n√©chal, 2006; Levy et al., 2006; Hood et al., 2008).
Several studies (S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002; S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal, Pagan, Lever, & Ouellette, 2008; Hood, Conlon, & Andrews, 2008) have shown that storybook exposure and shared reading at home during the preschool years are related to language development, but some studies have revealed that storybook exposure alone is not related to early literacy skills.
S√©n√©chal and LeFevre (2002) found that ‚Äúexperiences that included more formal interactions with print, such as teaching about reading, were associated with the development of emergent literacy‚Äù (p.
The Home Literacy Model (S√©n√©chal, LeFevre, Thomas & Daly, 1998; S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002) serves as the framework for other research studies (S√©n√©chal, 2006; Hood, Conlon & Andrews, 2008) involving storybook exposure and parent teaching of literacy in the home, as well as the present study.
This lack of relation suggests that while some parents who read to their children also tutor them in literacy skills, many others do not (S√©n√©chal, 2006).

For example, research has shown that children‚Äôs exposure to shared book reading is related to receptive vocabulary whereas word-focused instruction by parents correlates with the acquisition of decoding skills (Bus, van Ijzendoorn, & Pellegrini, 1995; Evans, Shaw, & Bell, 2000; S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2001, 2002; S√©n√©chal, LeFevre, Thomas, & Daley, 1998).
None of the sampled activities approached the frequency of shared storybook reading, which similar groups of parents report doing, on average, every day (S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal et al., 1998).
Storybook reading does not foster the mechanical aspects of reading directly (unless instruction in word decoding is included as a component of the shared reading activity), but it appears to be a crucial component of how children develop the language skills that help them to become good comprehenders once they have mastered decoding (S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002) and may also encourage children to enjoy and value reading as an activity (S√©n√©chal, 2006).
The conceptual framework for this research was adapted from research on the relations between children‚Äôs home experiences and literacy development (e.g., Evans et al., 2000; S√©n√©chal, 2006; S√©n√©chal & LeFevre, 2002)."

One method that satisfies all three criteria is dominance analysis (Budescu, 1993).
The difficulty in assessing the importance of a variable stems from the differing definitions of importance and the differing methods for evaluating importance (Budescu, 1993; Darlington, 1968; Kruskal, 1987).

A few studies, which will be described in more detail in Chapter 2, have even found links between linguistic measures at the very onset of receptive and expressive language development, and later reading skills (Scarborough, 1990b; Shapiro et al., 1990; Walker, Greenwood, Hart, & Carta, 1994).
As with previous studies, the developmental window studied in which results are reported is crucial (Scarborough, 1990b).
Even when in this particular study of atypical language correlations with reading comprehension were slightly stronger for receptive than for expressive language, abundant evidence reviewed here has shown that many expressive deficits could have at times, a stronger level of prediction than their receptive counterparts (Justice et al., 2009; Scarborough, 1990b; Shapiro et al., 1990), or a complementary level of prediction when added to receptive deficits (Simkin & Conti-Ramsden, 2006).
Expressive skills are important because some of the earliest precursors to reading have been very early speech measures (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Harlaar, Hayiou-Thomas, Dale, & Plomin, 2008; Scarborough, 1990b; Shapiro et al., 1990) and because of the great overlap between language and reading disorders (Bishop & Snowling, 2004; Catts, Adlof, Hogan, & Weismer, 2005).
Indeed, in children at familial risk of reading disorders, it was those high children who displayed deficits in expressive syntax and articulation errors as early as 2:06 years of age, the ones who eventually developed reading difficulties at 8 years of age (Scarborough, 1990b).
It has been shown that there is indeed further specification for the contribution of language skills to reading depending on the developmental window studied (Scarborough, 1990b; Scarborough, Rescorla, Tager-Flusberg, Fowler, & Sudhalter, 1991).
Overall, there is convergent evidence between the evidence reviewed here about typical language, and atypical early language reviewed before (Justice et al., 2009; Scarborough, 1990b) that the earliest expressive vocabulary and syntactic measures are significantly related to later reading skills.
Similarly, children at a high familial risk of acquiring reading disorders who eventually do develop reading difficulties have shown early expressive deficits (Lyytinen & Lyytinen, 2004; Scarborough, 1990b)."

Despite the consistent findings on an association between RAN and reading fluency across languages, it has been suggested that the role of RAN in predicting reading may be further emphasized in languages with a more transparent orthography (for reviews, see e.g., Kirby et al., 2010; Wolf et al., 2000).
In light of previous research and suggestions (Lovett, Steinbach, & Frijters, 2000; Norton & Wolf, 2012; Steacy et al., 2014; Wolf et al., 2000), reading fluency training is likely to be more efficient when it is multifaceted and the transfer effects between the different levels of reading are explicitly targeted.
Instead, RAN could be used as an indicator of reading difficulties before literacy-based measures can be used (i.e., before reading instruction; De Jong & van der Leij, 2003; Lerv√•g & Hulme, 2009; Puolakanaho et al., 2007; Reiter, 2001; Wolf et al., 2000), and as one of the tools for exploring the background of reading skills more thoroughly (Hammill, 2004).
RAN can be measured, using non-alphanumeric stimuli (objects and colors), already before any reading instruction is given, and it has been proven to be a reliable indicator of later reading skills and reading difficulties (De Jong & van der Leij, 2003; Lerv√•g & Hulme, 2009; Puolakanaho et al., 2007; Reiter, 2001; Schatschneider et al., 2004; Wolf et al., 2000).
Therefore one of the suggestions for the primary clinical use of a RAN test is to use it as a predictor of reading performance before reading instruction begins (Reiter, 2001; Wolf et al., 2000) and during school age as one of the tools for exploring the background of reading disabilities more thoroughly (Hammill).
Thus, as many researchers already concede, RAN is a multicomponential skill (Bowers & Ishaik, 2003; Denckla & Cutting, 1999; Georgiou & Parrila, 2013; N√§rhi et al., 2005; Salmi, 2008; Wolf et al., 2000; Wolf & Bowers, 1999)."

(1998) study was that storybook exposure, as indexed by parents‚Äô familiarity with children‚Äôs literature, was unrelated to parents‚Äô reports of teaching: Parents who frequently read books to their child did not necessarily report teaching their child to read and print words (see also  Evans et al., 2000;  Fitzgerald et al., 1991; Sonnenschein et al., 1996; Stipek et al., 1992).This pattern of results held for children in kindergarten and in grade 1.

In sum, the phonological hypothesis, which is the most influential account for reading problems, postulates deficits related to the access or the manipulation of phonemic information, or both, preventing efficient learning of graphemes/phonemes correspondences that are crucial to reading [29‚Äì61].
In summary, there is substantial evidence that dyslexics are affected by phonological processing deficits in consolidating and accessing phonological representations [2,58,78].

Our findings are also in accordance to a recent study by Landerl and Wimmer (2008) suggesting that phonological awareness is similarly important across orthographies in spelling (see also Caravolas, 2004).
Thus, our study reinforce the idea that a strong reciprocal effect from early reading development on phonological awareness in transparent orthographies reduce the role of phonological awareness in accounting for individual differences in reading as well as in discriminating between normal readers and children with reading difficulties (Caravolas, 2005; Goswami et al., 2005; Seymour et al., 2003; Ziegler & Goswami, 2005)."

According to these previous studies, RAN is a better predictor than PA because in languages with a high consistency of grapheme-phoneme correspondences, children quickly attain some proficiency in decoding strategies, within the first year of schooling (Defior et al., 2002; Goswami et al., 2005).
As outlined in Chapter 1, because of the transparency of this language, decoding strategies appear to develop rapidly (Goswami et al., 2005), and phonological awareness of phonemes also seems to develop quickly, since children have to rely on this small unit to decode words.
However, the acquisition rate of phonological awareness of each unit does not seem to be universal, but acquires specific characteristics according to the transparency of the language that is being learned (Goswami et al., 2005).
In fact, the results indicated that after one year of reading instruction, phoneme awareness improved dramatically, but only for the German children, for identical words (Goswami et al., 2005).
Several studies have suggested that proficiency in decoding is quickly achieved during the first year of reading instruction (Defior et al., 2002; Goswami et al., 2005).
The former would be easily perceived by children, even before the acquisition of reading (Goswami et al., 2005; Goswami & Bryant, 1990), whereas the latter is more difficult to access because children need to know something about reading and spelling in order to develop some phonological awareness of phonemes (Goswami, 2001).
There was particular interest in studying Spanish because according to some theories, children learning to read transparent languages seem to quickly attain some proficiency in decoding strategies within the first year of schooling (Defior et al., 2002; Goswami et al., 2005)."

Children tend to learn the names of the letters in their own names first, and this benefit may extend to the sounds associated with those letters (Clay, 1975; Justice et al., 2006; Treiman & Kessler, 2003; Treiman et al., 1998).
Children‚Äôs knowledge of their own written names, their ability to recognize and identify letters by name, and their phonological awareness (PA) ability, the ability to reflect on sounds within words apart from their meanings, all support the development of lettersound knowledge (Evans et al., 2006; Foy & Mann, 2006; Kim, Petscher, Foorman, & Zhou, 2010; Treiman et al., 1998).
Letters were grouped by letter-name structure as consonantvowel (CV = 1; b, d, j, k, p, t, v, z), vowel-consonant (VC = 1; f, l, n, r, s), not associated (c, g, h, w, y), or vowels (Vowels = 1; a, e, i, o, u) in accordance with prior studies (Evans et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2010; Treiman et al., 1998).
Much research has established that the sounds of CV letters are the easiest for children to learn and most likely to be known early in a child‚Äôs educational career (Evans et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2010; McBride-Chang, 1999; Piasta & Wagner, 2010b; Share, 2004; Treiman & Broderick, 1998; Treiman et al., 1998).
Our finding of a medium effect size for the first letter and sound of a child‚Äôs first name supports the own-name advantage hypothesis, expanding this finding, which has long been established in the realm of letter-name knowledge, to letter sounds as well (Clay, 1975; Justice et al., 2006; Treiman & Kessler, 2003; Treiman et al., 1998).
Previous research suggests that letter sounds that are more closely connected to their names are easier to learn and more likely to be known at an earlier age (CardosoMartins, Mesquita, & Ehri, 2011; Evans et al., 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999; Piasta & Wagner, 2010b; Share, 2004; Treiman & Broderick, 1998; Treiman et al., 1998).
Research on letter-sound knowledge in young children has often focused on the overall predictive and developmental relationships between letter-name knowledge, the ability to identify a letter by its name, and letter-sound knowledge (Evans, Bell, Shaw, Moretti, & Page, 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999; Share, 2004; Treiman & Broderick, 1998; Treiman et al., 1998).
The relationship between the letter name and its sound, the relative difficulty of identifying and isolating a letter‚Äôs sound, and the number of sounds a letter can represent, are all factors that may make some letters more likely to be mastered earlier and some to be mastered later or require more explicit instruction (Evans et al., 2006; Huang & Invernizzi, 2012; Justice et al., 2006; McBride-Chang, 1999; Treiman et al., 1998)."

Thus, screening at the beginning of the school year can provide some information relevant to the prediction of word reading skills, but measurement of variable growth in response to instruction can add significantly to this prediction (Catts et al., in press; Vellutino et al., 2008).

2113561777,genetic influences on language impairment and literacy problems in children same or different,dorothy v m bishop,2001,1517211763,"However, as previously suggested, it is currently unclear whether SLI is best conceptualized as a single syndrome or an umbrella term for a number of different language disorders, and this hampers attempts to elucidate the role of genes in causing SLI (Bishop, 2001).
It has been suggested that auditory processing may be environmentally mediated in children with SLI (Bishop, 2001) and data on musical experience and training were available for analysis.
It has been suggested that in children with SLI, limitations in auditory short-term memory may have a genetic origin whereas auditory processing abilities may be environmentally mediated (Bishop, 2001).
It is possible that those with SLI find it difficult to repeat non-words because it necessitates the discrimination of rapid sequences of speech sounds (Bishop, 2001).
It may be that SLI is associated with additional limitations in auditory processing that contribute to performance on measures of music and language cognition and such underlying auditory processing difficulties may be an additional risk factor for the onset of SLI (Bishop, 2001).
Similarly, twin studies have demonstrated a higher concordance rate of SLI for MZ twins as compared with DZ twins (Bishop, 2001).
This means that there is considerable variation in the profile of linguistic deficits observed in individuals diagnosed with this disorder (Bishop, 2001).
Thus it may be that in the children with SLI, limitations in both auditory processing and auditory short-term memory were present and contributed to the linguistic impairments observed (Bishop, 2001).
Whilst it has been demonstrated that there is a genetic component to SLI, genetics alone cannot fully explain the etiology of this disorder and it has been suggested that genetic constraints in auditory short-term memory interact with environmentally mediated limitations in auditory processing to give rise to language difficulties severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of SLI (Bishop, 2001)."

Amodel such as this was proposed by Bishop and Snowling (2004) in a recent review of the literature.
Indeed, studies have shown that children with SLI often have problems in learning to recognize printed words (Bishop & Adams, 1990, Catts, 1993; Catts, Fey, Tomblin,&Zhang, 2002;McArthur et al., 2000; Snowling et al., 2000; Tallal, Allard, & Curtiss, 1988). For example, Tallal et al. (1988) found that approximately 67% of children with SLI at 4 years of age showed low achievement in word recognition at age 8.
Specifically, Bishop and Snowling (2004) proposed that SLI and dyslexia typically share deficits in phonological processing and word reading but differ in that SLI is also characterized by significant oral language problems and dyslexia is not (i.
Studies have also demonstrated that heritability for dyslexia is higher when the disorder is combined with a deficit in nonword repetition (Bishop, 2001; Bishop, Adams, & Norbury, 2004; Raskind, Hsu, Berninger, Thomson, & Wijsman, 2000)."

It is imperative that instructional practices incorporate phonological awareness to set the foundation for future learning success, and that progress monitoring be implemented and remediated early (Foorman, Breier et al., 2003; Phillips et al., 2008; Shaywitz et al., 2008).
Minority students begin kindergarten with lower readiness levels, leading to a continual process of catch up, and resulting in severe disadvantages from the start of school (Bailet, Repper, Piasta, & Murphy, 2009; Bowey, 1995; Fry, 2007; Peisner-Feinberg et al., 2001; Phillips et al., 2008).

In fact, in normal development, several studies have found that this variable is able to explain aspects of reading other than recoding (usually explained by PA), such as reading fluency and reading comprehension (Anthony et al., 2006; Badian, 1998; Cronin & Carver, 1998; Denckla & Cutting, 1999; Geva & Zadeh, 2006; Korhonen, 1995; Manis et al., 1999; Scarborough, 1998; Schatscheneider, Fletcher, Francis, Carlson & Foorman, 2004; Torgesen et al., 1997; Wolf & Bowers, 2000).

More importantly, we add evidence that confirms the findings of Share (2004) and Treiman and Broderick (1998) that the sounds associated with the VC letters, f, l, n, r, s are also more likely to be known than the sounds associated with vowels or NA letters, which differs from the findings of Evans et al.

All of these factors can act in concert, making letter sounds easier or more challenging depending on the interaction among characteristics related to individual children and individual letters (Evans et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2010) The present study aims to simultaneously examine the association of several factors with children‚Äôs letter-sound knowledge at the beginning of kindergarten.
Because letter-name structure and PA both demonstrate a significant association with letter-sound knowledge, one mechanism for explaining these factors could be that PA helps children to extract the letter sounds from the letter names that they know (Evans et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2010).
First, while several of the hypotheses tested are not new, there are only a limited number of recent studies (Kim et al., 2010; Piasta & Wagner, 2010b) that have specifically tested these hypotheses simultaneously as they relate to letter-sound knowledge.
Letters were grouped by letter-name structure as consonantvowel (CV = 1; b, d, j, k, p, t, v, z), vowel-consonant (VC = 1; f, l, n, r, s), not associated (c, g, h, w, y), or vowels (Vowels = 1; a, e, i, o, u) in accordance with prior studies (Evans et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2010; Treiman et al., 1998).

Based on growing evidence, most researchers would now support the reciprocal model of the phonological awareness-reading ability relationship (e.g. Castles & Coltheart, 2004; Fuchs et al., 2001; Hogan, Catts, and Little, 2005; McBride-Chang, 1995; Nation, 2008; Stanovich, 1986; Wagner et al., 1997).
Further evidence of this theory comes from studies that find no independent influence of RAN on word reading beyond other measures of phonological awareness (Cardoso & Pennington, 2004; Schatschneider, Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, & Foorman, 2004; Wagner et al., 1997).
It is commonly interpreted as reflecting the speed with which item names can be retrieved and articulated (Share, 1995; Wagner et al., 1997).
Research has demonstrated that phonological awareness strongly influences reading (Adams, 1990; Goswami & Bryant, 1990; Nation, 2008; Rack, Hulme, & Snowling, 1993; Wagner et al., 1997).
The influence of phonological awareness on reading ability is known to extend until fourth grade (Catts et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 1997).
The value of early intervention is made evident through longitudinal studies that support the stability of phonological processes through the school age period (Bus & van IJzendoorn, 1999; Wagner et al., 1997) and advances in the measurement of phonological awareness that allow for early deficits to be detected in the preschool period (Lonigan et al.
This would be consistent with the hypothesis that the relationship between phonological awareness and word reading is bi-directional (McBride-Chang, 1995; Perfetti, 1985; Stanovich, 1986; Wagner et al., 1997) which suggests that greater word reading ability may help children 'pick-up' or notice the phonological structure of words more easily."

Although phonological abilities appear to be Q2 quite stable over time, there are age-related differences associated with the prediction of reading outcome (Lonigan et al., 2000; Wagner et al., 1997).
For example, letter knowledge and phonological awareness are key precursors to early decoding skills (e.g., Caravolas, Violin, & Hulme, 2005; Frost, Madsbjerg, Neiders√∏e, Olofsson, & S√∏renson, 2005; Lonigan et al., 2000; Muter, Hulme, Snowling, & Stevenson, 2004; Olofsson & Nieders√∏e, 1999; Wagner et al., 1997).
Furthermore, it is important to examine predictors of reading impairment over a period of time as their prognostic value may change as a function of school experience and developmental maturation (Muter et al., 2004; Wagner et al., 1997; Wesseling & Reitsma, 2001).
Rather than typifying a direct route to decoding, letter knowledge may serve to mediate other factors such as phonological awareness (Foy & Mann, 2001; Lonigan et al., 2000; Wagner et al., 1997).
The relationship between preliteracy skills and reading ability has been well established (e.g., Carroll, Snowling, Hulme, & Stevenson, 2003; Lonigan, Burgess, & Anthony, 2000; Wagner et al., 1997).
Thus, several studies have examined the development of specific phonological processing skills or letter knowledge as a function of later reading (e.g., Caravolas et al., 2005; Lepola et al., 2005; Muter et al., 2004; Torgeson et al., 1994; Wagner et al., 1997)."

Further research comparing different types of instruction would be of great interest; for example, visual memory may be relied heavily upon more heavily if children are initially taught to recognise words by ‚Äòsight‚Äô, just as vocabulary skills have been shown to correlate closely with early word reading when children are taught by a more eclectic whole language approach (McGeown et al., 2012; Wagner et al., 1997).
However, analysis and synthesis skills have been found to be highly correlated (Castles & Coltheart 2004; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994) and performance on both have been found to correlate with the acquisition of early reading skills (Wagner & Torgesen, 1987; Wagner et al., 1997).
However, as with vocabulary, research suggests that memory span may be a poor correlate or predictor of early word reading when compared to, or after accounting for, phonological awareness (de Jong & van der Leij, 1999; Rohl & Pratt, 1995; Wagner et al., 1997).
In addition to letter sound knowledge and phonological awareness, vocabulary knowledge is often correlated with early reading skills (Muter et al., 2004; Muter & Snowling, 1998; Wagner et al., 1997).
Verbal short term memory (the temporary storage of sound-based information) is also often associated with children‚Äôs reading skill (Brunswick, Martin, & Rippon, 2012; Parilla, Kirby, & McQuarrie, 2004; Rapala & Brady, 1990; Wagner et al., 1997)."

According to the ‚ÄòDouble Deficit Hypothesis‚Äô, this skill is a second centre of deficit in dyslexia, which is different from PA, making a unique and independent contribution to explaining reading difficulties related to speed (Compton, 2000; de Jong & van der Leij, 1999; Manis, Seidenberg & Doi, 1999; Mann & Wimmer, 2002; Wagner et al., 1997).

As suggested by Wolf and Bowers (1999) and demonstrated by recent research (Wolf, Bowers, & Biddle, 2000), rapid naming is a factor separate from phonological awareness or working memory and has a significant specific contribution to reading development (Manis et al., 1999; Wagner et al., 1997).

In sum, the phonological hypothesis, which is the most influential account for reading problems, postulates deficits related to the access or the manipulation of phonemic information, or both, preventing efficient learning of graphemes/phonemes correspondences that are crucial to reading [29‚Äì61].
In this way, the supporters of the auditory processing deficit theory do not deny the existence of the phonological deficit, but rather see it as secondary to a more basic auditory impairment [60].
Of course, this makes it questionable whether the auditory problem could be regarded as the principle cause of reading problems [60].
Rather, it appears to encompass a broad range of complex spectro-temporal processing abilities that cannot easily be characterized in a coherent way [60,92].
The most unifying hypothesis about the core deficit of DD is that these individuals have specific impairments in the representation, storage, and/or retrieval of speech sounds [56‚Äì60].

The present investigation examined the hypothesis that early auditory temporal processing deficits cause later specific reading disability by impairing phonological processing (Farmer & Klein 1995;  Tallal 1980, 1984 ).In the auditory domain, however, there seems to be greater progress toward a coherent hypothesis that clearly spells out how a temporal processing deficit might impair reading acquisition (Farmer & Klein 1995;  Tallal 1980, 1984 ). Tallal (1980, 1984) , has been most recently expounded by Farmer & Klein (1995) who propose that a disordered or delayed temporal processing system during infancy would make it difficult for children to discriminate and categorize the sounds of language.Farmer and Klein go on to argue (following  Tallal 1980, 1984 ) that poor speech discrimination may contribute to reading problems by causing difficulties in retrieving phonological codes, impaired phonemic awareness, and difficulty learning grapheme-phoneme correspondences (Tallal 1980).Farmer and Klein go on to argue (following Tallal 1980, 1984) that poor speech discrimination may contribute to reading problems by causing difficulties in retrieving phonological codes, impaired phonemic awareness, and difficulty learning grapheme-phoneme correspondences ( Tallal 1980 ). Tallal (1980)  compared 20 reading-disabled children aged 8 to 12 (mean 9;7) to 12 normal children (aged 8;5) on a task called the Repetition Test. Tallal (1980)  reported that 45 percent of her reading-disabled group made more errors on the short-ISI subtest than the worst control (Figure 1, p. 190).However, the pattern of results was not consistent with the temporal processing explanation as formulated by  Tallal (1980, 1984)  and by Farmer & Klein (1995) their account predicts a selective deficit in the processing of rapid acoustic changes claimed to be similar to those required in the processing of stop consonants but not steady state information such as vowels.specifically, the hypothesis that early auditory temporal processing deficits cause later phonological deficits and specific reading disability as proposed by  Tallal (1980, 1984) , and Farmer & Klein (1995).On balance, these longitudinal data provide little support for the claim that early temporal processing deficits may cause phonological processing deficits and specific reading disability via the causal chain proposed by  Tallal (1980, 1984)  and by Farmer & Klein (1995).This is consistent with both the  Tallal (1980)  and Tallal & Stark (1982) studies in that temporal deficits were manifest only when dyslexics were unscreened for concomitant language deficits, as was the case here."

Experiment 1a served to select a group of poor readers who had difficulty with synthetic /halIdal TOJ in a test modeled after Tallal's, and a group of good readers who had no such difficulty; both groups were also tested on /hal-/dal discrimination. Selection was necessary to ensure that the poor readers did indeed have difficulty with /bal-/dal TOJ, because both Tallal (1980) and Reed (1989) found poor readers whose TOJ performance fell within the normal range.
In the first of a series of studies, Tallal and Piercy (1973) found developmentally aphasic children (n=12) to be significantly impaired, in comparison to an equal number of age-matched, normal controls, on tasks involving rapid auditory perceptual processing.
Tallal (1980), the original proponent of this account, asserts that reading-disabled children cannot easily process brief and/or rapidly changing acoustic events, whether speech or non-speech.
The selection of subjects on the basis of performance on /ha!-/da! TOJ was an essential part of the experimental design, both to ensure that the poor readers displayed behavior consistent with the deficit that Tallal (1980) proposes may underlie difficulties in segmenting and recoding speech phonemically, and to ensure that the good readers differed significantly from the poor readers in this respect.
The sequence and structure of the training and test procedures exactly followed those of Tallal (1980), with minor adaptations incorporated by Reed (1989) in her successful replication of Tallal's work.
These demands ruled out a number of poor readers (n=10), who like over half of Tallal's (1980) subjects ontone TOJ, failed to make errors on /baJ-/daJ TOJ.
We turn next to the paper in which Tallal (1980) extended her hypothesis concerning the perceptual deficits of dysphasic children to children with reading impairments (cf."

A number of authors have demonstrated that children with reading difficulty frequently display deficits in phonological processing (Snowling et al., 2000; Stanovich, 1999; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987; Vellutino et al., 1991).
Early identification of at-risk readers has attracted much attention in recent literature (Boudreau & Hedberg, 1999; Catts et al., 1999; Catts, Fey, Zhang, & Tomblin, 2001; Gilbertson & Bramlett, 1998; McNamara, Scissons, & Dahleu, 2005; Pikulski, 1994; Simpson & Everatt, 2005; Snowling et al., 2000; Torgesen, 1998).

Since this process of making connections between orthography and phonology relies on the use of vocabulary knowledge and sentence context (Snowling et al., 2000), children with SLI are likely to be at a disadvantage. Data presented by Snowling et al. (2000) provide confirmatory support for the links between LI and reading difficulty.
Two longitudinal studies provide empirical evidence, supporting the intuitions of many, that the presence of language deficits in the preschool years renders a child far more likely to experience reading difficulty during formal education (Catts et al., 2002; Snowling et al., 2000)."

However a different picture emerged when the Bishop and Adams cohort was followed into adolescence: a greater proportion of these pupils had difficulties with both word reading and reading comprehension (Snowling et al., 2000), which brings us to the second hypothesis of the illusory recovery of SLI children.
There is now abundant converging evidence those children diagnosed with a language impairment tend to have reading difficulties as a group (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Catts, Adlof et al., 2005; DeThorne et al., 2006; Snowling et al., 2000)."

Our findings concerning nonverbal cognitive abilities are in line with the results of other studies that have reported that children with LI and low nonverbal IQ have poorer reading outcomes than those with normal nonverbal IQ (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Snowling et al., 2000).
Our findings of continued, long-term deficits in the reading achievement of children with LI are consistent with the few other studies that have examined reading achievement into the later grades in this population (Johnson et al., 1999; Snowling et al., 2000; Young et al., 2002).
The results of this study and several others (Johnson et al., 1999; Snowling et al., 2000; Young et al., 2002) demonstrate that the presence of LI in kindergarten is an important indicator of a reading disability in the later school grades."

Furthermore, given the mixed findings for the growth trajectories of reading skills in individuals with SLI (Catts et al., 2008; Snowling et al., 2000) it would also be of interest to examine the relationship between language-related abilities (phonological memory, expressive and receptive language) and reading skills in this subgroup in order to provide insights into potential sources of variation.
However, when the data for reading accuracy and comprehension were examined separately for the sample (excluding those with general delay only), results revealed that 43%of the participants nowhad reading accuracy difficulties (Snowling et al., 2000).

However, as in previous studies, literacy problems were by no means universal in childrenwith a preschool history of a speech sound disorder, and many children in the SSD group achieved literacy scores in the average range (Leitao et al., 1997; Nathan et al., 2004; Snowling et al., 2000).
Some studies have reported that children with isolated speech problems performed similarly to controls on reading tasks (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Catts, 1993; Nathan et al., 2004; Snowling et al., 2000), whereas others have found evidence of impairment relative to matched controls or national norms (Bird et al.

Thus, the present results agree with a growing body of research indicating that a substantial portion of the overlap between SSD and RD is due to the third variable of LI (Bishop &Adams, 1990; Catts, 1993; Larrivee & Catts, 1999; Leitao et al., 1997; Lewis et al., 2000; Nathan et al., 2004; Snowling et al., 2000)."

Our study extends this finding to reading difficulties (de Jong & van der Leij, 2003; Holopainen et al., 2001; Landerl & Wimmer, 2000; van den Bos, 1998; Wimmer, 1993).
Several studies conducted within countries with a transparent orthography seem to suggest that RAN remains as a manifest problem in children with reading difficulties whereas deficits in phonological awareness are manifested as a problem only in the very first stages of literacy acquisition (e.g., de Jong & van der Leij, 2002, 2003; Wimmer, 1993; Wimmer et al., 2000).
Similar to research on normal development in reading, measures of RAN seem to be better at discriminating between normal readers and children with reading difficulties after a few years of reading instruction (Brizzolara et al., 2006; de Jong & van der Leij, 2002, 2003; Holopainen et al., 2001; van den Bos, 1998; Wimmer, 1993; Wimmer et al., 1998; Wimmer, Mayringer, & Landerl, 2000; Wolf, Pfeil, Lotz, & Biddle, 1994)."

For languages with relatively consistent orthographies, word recognition speed has been found to be predicted by only naming speed in normally developing readers after Grade 1 and in dyslectic children after Grades 2 or 3 (Aro & Wimmer, 2003; Van den Bos, 1998; Van den Bos, Zijlstra, & lutje Spelberg, 2002; Van den Bos, 2008; De Jong & Van der Leij, 1999; Korhonen, 1995; Wimmer, 1993; Wimmer, Mayringer, & Landerl, 1998; Wimmer, Mayringer, & Landerl, 2000).
In normal readers and dyslexic children, the influence of phonological awareness but not naming speed on word recognition appears to be limited to the ends of Grade 1 and Grade 2, respectively (Aro & Wimmer, 2003; De Jong & Van der Leij, 1999; Eleveld, 2005; Korhonen, 1995; Van den Bos, 1998; Van den Bos, Zijlstra, & lutje Spelberg, 2002; Wimmer, 1993; Wimmer, Mayringer, & Landerl, 1998; Wimmer, Mayringer, & Landerl, 2000).
In other research, Wimmer et al. (2000) showed spelling problems in Grade
The effects of phonological awareness and naming speed on the word recognition skills of children also appear to be fairly independent (De Jong & Van der Leij, 1999; Wimmer, 1993; Wimmer et al., 2000), and De Jong and Van der Leij (1999) also found no influence of the speed of word recognition on phonological

Again, this pattern of findings supports previous research claiming that the impact of RAN on reading increases as a result of more proficient literacy skills (see also De Jong & van der Leij, 2002, 2003; Wimmer, 1993).

One claim from this research is that phonological awareness might be a less important prereading skill in predicting literacy development in regular orthographies than in irregular orthographies and that the role of phonological awareness in regular orthographies is mainly restricted to the first two grades in school (De Jong & van der Leij, 2002; Landerl & Wimmer, 2000; Wimmer, 1993).

Early difficulty with phonological coding in the first year of school can be observed in some children with a phonological awareness deficit (Wimmer, 1996a), but as the present findings show, these early difficulties are nearly always overcome in Grade 3. In their sample of Dutch children, de Jong and van der Leij (1999) also found that the effect of early phonological awareness differences were limited to Grade 1 reading.
The present finding that an early single naming-speed deficit is predictive for later reading fluency impairments is consistent with the converse findings that German dyslexic children (defined by poor reading fluency) exhibit a massive concurrent naming-speed deficit but little phonological awareness deficit (Wimmer, 1993; Wimmer et al., 1998; Wolf, Pfeil, Lotz, & Biddie, 1994)."

Findings that expressive measures at a younger preschool age, 3-4 years, tend to be equal or stronger predictors of literacy than the measures collected later at age 5 (Scarborough, 2005), highlight not only the developmental issues of measuring reading beyond the initial decoding-focused instruction years, but also the methodological problems inherent in capturing developmental growth with valid linguistic indices from language samples in school-aged children.
Given that different sub-skills may play differential roles at different points of development (Scarborough, 2005; Vellutino et al., 1994) it was also important to focus on a narrow developmental window.
In addition, findings that earlier measures of expressive language were more predictive of reading outcomes than later expressive measures (Scarborough, 2005) in the context of a lack of methodological consensus for measuring school-age language samples (Scott & Stokes, 1995) left the question open as to whether this was a case of methodological constraints, or one of an actual phenomenon, where later spoken language is actually less predictive of reading abilities.
More researchers have already emphasised that although essential, phonological awareness is not in itself sufficient, and have advocated for recognising the role of a more comprehensive set that includes broader language sub-skills when trying to predict reading development beyond the early primary years (Bishop, 1991; Nation & Snowling, 2004; Paris, 2005; Scarborough, 2005).
Since it has also been established that different subskills may play differential roles at different points of development (Scarborough, 2005; Vellutino et al., 1994) it was important to focus on a narrow developmental window.
Still, more serious criticism to the examination of the relationship between school-age language and reading is the argument that preschool language measures (ages 3 and 4), both receptive and expressive, are even more predictive of subsequent reading skill than later kindergarten measures at 5 years of age (Scarborough, 2005).
These two issues seem of particular importance regarding the contribution of expressive measures given reported evidence that earlier measures of language are more predictive of reading skills than later language measures (Scarborough, 2005)."

Larkin and Snowling (2008) found that spelling ability failed to differentiate 23 SLI children with a mean-age of 10 years from 22 same-aged SRD peers and 15 younger reading-age matched children.
One hypothesis is that learned compensatory strategies produce improved reading skill such that the gap between predicted and actual reading skill is breached, whilst the second contends that reading difficulty impacts on exposure to the language and general knowledge contained within written material, resulting in poorer performance on cognitive tasks and a lowered VIQ and thus FSIQ over time (Ackerman, Weir, Holloway, & Dykman, 1995; Rutter & Yule, 1975; Snowling, 2000; Stanovich, 1991a).
Similarly, SRD research has found that across the school years children can meet and then not meet SRD criteria (Snowling, 2000).
Since its inception the term dyslexia has caused significant disagreement with dyslexia used to define isolated reading difficulties, combined reading and writing deficits, as well as being a general descriptor for all learning difficulties (Fletcher, Foorman, Shaywitz, & Shaywitz, 1999; Selikowitz, 1993; Snowling, 2000).

It is widely believed that impaired phonological processing is the key deficit in developmental dyslexia (Snowling, 2000).

This hypothesis proposes that dyslexia can be traced to poorly specified representations of the phonological features of spoken words (Hulme & Snowling, 1992; Metsala, 1997; Snowling, 2000).

Both longitudinal correlational investigations (Bradley and Bryant 1985; Maclean, Bryant, and Bradley 1987; Perfetti et al. 1987; Torneus 1984) and experimental investigations (Bradley and Bryant 1985; Fox and Routh 1984; Lundberg 1987; Olofsson and Lundberg 1985; Trei man and Baron 1983) have indicated a causal connection.
For example, Bradley and Bryant (1985) found that their sound categorization task accounted for an increase in variance explained even after chronological age, a picture vocabulary test, the WISC, and a mem ory test had been entered into the regression equation.
Importantly, there is in creasing evidence that this linkage is a causal one (Bradley and Bryant 1985; Lundberg 1987; Maclean, Bryant and Bradley 1987; Perfetti 1985; Stan ovich 1986b, 1988).
