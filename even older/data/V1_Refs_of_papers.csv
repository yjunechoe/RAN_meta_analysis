3,16959605,effects of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and anxiety on attention working memory and academic achievement in children and adolescents a structural equation modeling approach,2013,,,Alexandra Noelle Sturm,"Attention and working memory, two constructs that affect youth who have ADHD and anxiety, are essential in establishing automaticity and success in academic achievement. Using data from a large study involving 502 children and adolescents (332 diagnosed with ADHD, 145 diagnosed with anxiety disorder, and 126 diagnosed with neither), ages 7 to 15 years, this paper applies structural equation modeling to test the sequential relationship between the latent constructs of attention, working memory, and academic achievement, and the effects of symptoms of ADHD and anxiety on each construct, and also to assess consistency in measurement techniques of each underlying construct. The study establishes that the structural equation model created to replicate a theory of automaticity fit the data from this sample well, and there was significant sequential prediction between attention, working memory, and academic achievement. In addition, better performance on measures of attention and working memory predicts higher academic achievement, as relative weaknesses in academic achievement seen in children and adolescents with ADHD can be explained largely by deficits in attention and working memory. Anxiety symptoms were unrelated to attention, working memory, and academic achievement, when controlling for ADHD. However, a significant negative correlation between harm avoidance, a trait of anxiety, and ADHD symptoms suggest that it may be of value to explore the theoretical underpinnings of the relationship between harm avoidance, ADHD, and academic achievement."

8,34916195,supporting children s language and literacy skills the effectiveness of shared book reading intervention strategies with parents,2012,,,Soh Hong Sim,"Parents are encouraged to read with their children from an early age because shared book reading helps children to develop their language and early literacy skills. A pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) research design was adopted to investigate the influence of two forms of a shared reading intervention (Dialogic Reading and Dialogic Reading with the addition of Print Referencing) on children’s language and literacy skills. Dialogic reading is a validated shared reading intervention that has been shown to improve children’s oral language skills prior to formal schooling (Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). Print referencing is another form of shared reading intervention that has the potential to have effects on children’s print knowledge as they begin school (Justice & Ezell, 2002). However, training parents to use print referencing strategies at home has not been researched extensively although research findings indicate its effectiveness when used by teachers in the early years of school.

Eighty parents of Preparatory year children from three Catholic schools in low income areas in the outer suburbs of a metropolitan city were trained to deliver specific shared reading strategies in an eight-week home intervention. Parents read eight books to their children across the period of the intervention. Each book was requested to be read at least three times a week. There were 42 boys and 38 girls ranging in age from 4.92 years to 6.25 years (M=5.53, SD=0.33) in the sample. The families were randomly assigned to three groups: Dialogic Reading (DR); Dialogic Reading with the addition of Print Referencing (DR + PR); and a Control group. Six measures were used to assess children’s language skills at pre and post, and follow-up (three months after the intervention). These measures assessed oral language (receptive and expressive vocabulary), phonological awareness skills (rhyme, word completion), alphabet knowledge, and concepts about print.

Results of the intervention showed that there were significant differences from pre to post between the two intervention groups and the control group on three measures: expressive vocabulary, rhyme, and concepts about print. The shared reading strategies delivered by parents of the dialogic reading, and dialogic reading with the addition of print referencing, showed promising results to develop children’s oral language skills in terms of expressive vocabulary and rhyme, as well as understanding of the concepts about print. At follow-up, when the children entered Year 1, the two intervention groups (DR and DR + PR) group had significantly maintained their knowledge of concepts about prints when compared with the control group. Overall, the findings from this intervention study did not show that dialogic reading with the addition of print referencing had stronger effects on children’s early literacy skills than dialogic reading alone. 

The research also explored if pre-existing family factors impacted on the outcomes of the intervention from pre to post. The relationships between maternal education and home reading practices prior to intervention and child outcomes at post were considered. However, there were no significant effects of maternal education and home literacy activities on child outcomes at post. Additionally, there were no significant effects for the level of compliance of parents with the intervention program in terms of regular weekly reading to children during the intervention period on child outcomes at post. These non-significant findings are attributed to the lack of variability in the recruited sample. Parents participating in the intervention had high levels of education, although they were recruited from schools in low socio-economic areas; parents were already highly engaged in home literacy activities at recruitment; and the parents were highly compliant in reading regularly to their child during the intervention. 

Findings of the current study did show that training in shared reading strategies enhanced children’s early language and literacy skills. Both dialogic reading and dialogic reading with the addition of print referencing improved children’s expressive vocabulary, rhyme, and concepts about print at post intervention. Further research is needed to identify how, and if, print referencing strategies used by parents at home can be effective over and above the use of dialogic reading strategies. In this research, limitations of sample size and the nature of the intervention to use print referencing strategies at home may have restricted the opportunities for this research study to find more effects on children’s emergent literacy skills or for the effectiveness of combining dialogic reading with print referencing strategies. However, these results did indicate that there was value in teaching parents to implement shared reading strategies at home in order to improve early literacy skills as children begin formal schooling."

A total of 271 students participate (138 experimental group and 133 control group). The experimental group received instructions on phonological awareness and naming speed throughout three courses, and the control group followed the official curriculum. The instructions given to students of pre-school education (4 and 5 years old) and first grade of primary school (6 years old), were evaluated in writing with standardized test three years later. The experimental group obtained higher scores than the control group in the phonological and rapid naming tasks. And more interesting, the experimental group obtained better results in writing tasks. These results have important theoretical implications, as they show the relationship between phonological awareness and naming speed in learning to write. There are also educational implications, since it provides guidelines to facilitate the learning of writing in the classroom."

Archibald,"Investigations of the cognitive processes underlying Specific Language Impairment (SLI) have implicated deficits in the storage and processing of phonological or verbal information. This thesis reports five studies that investigated the role of short-term and working memory in children with SLI. Study 1 demonstrated SLI deficits on measures of verbal working memory, and short-term memory for verbal but not visuospatial information. Study 2 provided evidence that children with SLI perform at age-level on visuospatial working memory measures. Study 3 demonstrated slower processing in the SLI group across domains, as well as verbal storage decrements, with the greatest deficits found for tasks tapping both of these. Study 4 found SLI deficits on measures of nonword repetition in common use, with greater impairments on the task that relied to a lesser extent on short-term memory. Study 5 established more accurate recall for multisyllabic nonwords than matched single syllable lists for all groups, although the SLI group showed different patterns of phoneme retention. It is suggested that the combination of deficits in generalized processing speed and verbal storage in SLI may be expected to have a drastic and detrimental impact on learning, and provides an account of the disorder that could encompass the range of impairments observed in SLI. The findings also suggest that factors additional to short-term memory contribute to poor nonword repetition in SLI."

Jannoun, Vicky Slonims, Gillian Baird, Andrew Pickles, Dorothy V. M. Bishop, Gina Conti-Ramsden, Peter J. Helms","Approximately 4% of English-speaking children are affected by specific language impairment (SLI), a disorder in the development of language skills despite adequate opportunity and normal intelligence. Several studies have indicated the importance of genetic factors in SLI; a positive family history confers an increased risk of development, and concordance in monozygotic twins consistently exceeds that in dizygotic twins. However, like many behavioral traits, SLI is assumed to be genetically complex, with several loci contributing to the overall risk. We have compiled 98 families drawn from epidemiological and clinical populations, all with probands whose standard language scores fall > or =1.5 SD below the mean for their age. Systematic genomewide quantitative-trait-locus analysis of three language-related measures (i.e., the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Revised [CELF-R] receptive and expressive scales and the nonword repetition [NWR] test) yielded two regions, one on chromosome 16 and one on 19, that both had maximum LOD scores of 3.55. Simulations suggest that, of these two multipoint results, the NWR linkage to chromosome 16q is the most significant, with empirical P values reaching 10(-5), under both Haseman-Elston (HE) analysis (LOD score 3.55; P=.00003) and variance-components (VC) analysis (LOD score 2.57; P=.00008). Single-point analyses provided further support for involvement of this locus, with three markers, under the peak of linkage, yielding LOD scores >1.9. The 19q locus was linked to the CELF-R expressive-language score and exceeds the threshold for suggestive linkage under all types of analysis performed-multipoint HE analysis (LOD score 3.55; empirical P=.00004) and VC (LOD score 2.84; empirical P=.00027) and single-point HE analysis (LOD score 2.49) and VC (LOD score 2.22). Furthermore, both the clinical and epidemiological samples showed independent evidence of linkage on both chromosome 16q and chromosome 19q, indicating that these may represent universally important loci in SLI and, thus, general risk factors for language impairment"

Fisher","Children in foster care fare worse than their peers on many indicators of academic adjustment, exhibiting high rates of special education placement, discipline referrals, and school dropout (e.g., Scherr, 2007; Zima et al., 2000). Children in foster care also lag significantly behind their peers in reading, writing, numeracy, and language (Mitic & Rimer, 2002) and perform significantly worse on measures of academic and socioemotional adjustment compared to children from low socioeconomic backgrounds (Pears, Fisher, Bruce, Kim, & Yoerger, in press). This poor performance does not appear to be solely attributable to unique risk factors often found in children in foster care. For example, Fantuzzo and Perlman (2007) found that, even when other risk factors (e.g., birth and poverty risks) were controlled, being in out-of-home care significantly and independently predicted poor academic and behavioral adjustment for children in second grade.

Given the elevated risks for poor school adjustment among children in foster care, there is a need for research on the potential early precursors of school difficulties with this population. Additional knowledge about the reading development of children at risk for academic failure because of foster care placements could expand the scientific knowledge base about academic skill development in general, and could also allow service providers to tailor preventive intervention services to the needs of such populations (Justice, Invernizzi, Geller, Sullivan, & Welsch, 2005). Because child welfare agencies often have limited resources for screening and intervention services for children in foster care (Zima et al., 2000), such targeted interventions could aid agencies in maximizing resources to increase the chances of better school outcomes for these children.

Early reading skills are an important predictor of later academic and behavioral adjustment in the general population. Children who struggle with reading in the first and second grades are likely to exhibit difficulties into middle and high school (e.g., Cunningham & Stanovich, 1998). Poor reading skills have also been linked to behavioral difficulties at school, which may increase the likelihood of problems such as antisocial behavior and juvenile delinquency (Halonen, Aunola, Ahonen, & Nurmi, 2006). In one of the few studies to examine reading skills in school-aged children in foster care, Fantuzzo and Perlman (2007) suggested that children in out-of-home placements show markedly poorer reading skills than their peers as early as second grade. Reading difficulties may already be well-established by the second grade (Al Otaiba & Fuchs, 2006); thus, identifying risk factors for poor reading prior to school entry might help in preventing later problems.

To date, there are no published studies on prereading skills in children in foster care prior to school entry, and research regarding early screening could aid intervention efforts to prevent subsequent difficulties in this population. The prereading skills considered in this study have been linked to later reading abilities in the general population. In kindergarten, phonological awareness (i.e., the ability to distinguish sounds in words) predicts better reading outcomes across the early school years, and alphabetic understanding (i.e., the ability to recognize letters) is linked to well developed or deficit reading skills (National Institute for Literacy, 2009). General language skills also appear to be important to later reading abilities, particularly reading comprehension (e.g., Catts, Fey, Zhang, & Tomblin, 1999). Based on the deficits observed in the later academic functioning of children in foster care (Mitic & Rimer, 2002), we hypothesize that the children in our study would perform more poorly on measures of prereading skills as compared to the general population.


Schatschneider, Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, and Foorman (2004) noted that there was little agreement in the literature on the relative importance of specific prereading skills in predicting later reading abilities. Additionally, different prereading skills may be differentially important for specific populations to outcomes, and could be effective targets for intervention (Al Otaiba & Fuchs, 2006). We can best pinpoint those targets by testing such associations within particular populations such as children in foster care. In this study, we examined associations between prereading skills in children in foster care and teacher-rated early literacy skills in kindergarten, while controlling for the other prereading skills and an estimate of general intelligence. The following research questions guided the study: 


How do the prereading skills of children in foster care compare to those of general population children?


To what extent are particular prereading skills more important than others in predicting teacher-rated early literacy skills in kindergarten for children in foster care?"

English Language Learners (ELLs) with LD represent a vulnerable group of students, whose difficulties are frequently misunderstood, misattributed, or simply missed. This chapter introduces theoretical perspectives on L2 development, touching on topics such as cross-language transfer, and the development of basic vs. academic language proficiency. Research concerning the relevance of LD subtypes (i.e., “poor decoders” and “poor comprehenders”) to ELLs is discussed. Issues related to assessment are analyzed, focusing on how to tease apart expected L2 development from an ELL-LD profile. The chapter concludes with suggestions for educational interventions for ELLs with LD. We argue that in spite of the challenges, ELLs who may have an LD should be entitled to research-based, well-informed, culturally-sensitive assessment that can lead to appropriate educational intervention."

This chapter focuses on language processes and reading disabilities in children and future challenges for researchers in the field. To have linguistic competence in a language, children are required to know about the component rule systems that govern language form and content. To have communicative competence, children must also know how to make language function or work for them during social interaction. While linguists agree that meaningful language is bound by a system of structural rules, there is no consensus among investigators on how children acquire knowledge of the regulatory system. A common feature of both continuity and maturation theories is that switch-setting occurs during critical periods of brain development and after a specific point in time, acquiring a first language becomes more difficult, if not impossible. Learning to read an alphabetic language draws on children's knowledge of language form, content, and use within the cultural context in which they live."
49,146353584,an examination of the perceptions of educational leaders on the ensuring literacy for all initiative s impact on student reading achievement in louisiana,2013,,,Khanh Kim Nguyen-Dufour,"The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to examine the experiences of Louisiana’s Ensuring Literacy For All (ELFA) initiative from the perspective of educational administrators in order to identify: (a) the factors within ELFA that contributed to student reading performance; (b) the effects of the perceptions of ELFA administrators on student achievement; and (c) the components of effective leadership that attributed to the success of ELFA implementation. Bandura‘s (1993) socio-psychological theory of self efficacy was used to frame this study, which included six ELFA administrators from the state, district, and school level. The five findings of this study revealed the following: (1) high quality job-embedded professional development strengthened teachers’ capacity to achieve a shared purpose; (2) efficacious ELFA leaders believed that they could alter their school culture and increase student achievement, despite having a low performing student population; (3) the gradual elimination of funds detrimentally impacted all levels of governance and created a snowball effect that ultimately decreased student achievement; (4) the urgency to help students read on grade level ignited a willingness for ELFA educators to trust each other; and (5) the standardization of practices resulted in a common language that ELFA leaders used to produce results, ensure compliance, and build teacher capacity. This study revealed that ELFA leaders believed that they could overcome challenges such as having a low performing student population and obstacles such as shortage of funding and low parental involvement. The ELFA leaders’ self efficacy beliefs directly impacted their actions and behaviors as well as those under their supervision."

Wijsman","There is evidence for genetic contributions to reading disability, but the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with the clinical diagnosis may make identification of the underlying genetic basis difficult. In order to elucidate distinct phenotypic features that may be contributing to the genotypic heterogeneity, we assessed the familial aggregation patterns of Verbal IQ and 24 phenotypic measures associated with dyslexia in 102 nuclear families ascertained through probands in grades 1 through 6 who met the criteria for this disorder. Correlations between relatives were computed for all diagnostic phenotypes, using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. GEE is a recently developed semiparametric method for handling correlated data. The method is robust to model misspecification and flexible in adjusting for the subjects' characteristics and pedigree sizes as well as for the ascertainment process, while estimating the correlations between related subjects. The Nonword Memory (NWM) subtest of a prepublication version of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP) and Phonemic Decoding Efficiency (PDE) subtest of a prepublication version of the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) showed correlation patterns in relatives that are strongly supportive of a genetic basis. The Wechsler Scale Digit Span, the Word Attack subtest of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test—Revised, and the Spelling subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test—Third Edition had slightly weaker evidence of a genetic basis. Five additional phenotypes (the Spelling subtest of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, the Accuracy, Rate, and Comprehension subtests of the Gray Oral Reading Test—Third Edition, and Rapid Automatized Naming of Letters and Numbers) gave suggestive evidence of such a pattern. The results cross-validate in that evidence for a pattern consistent with a genetic basis was obtained for two measures of phonological short-term memory (CTOPP Nonword Memory and WISCIII or WAIS-R Digit Span), for two measures of phonological decoding (WRMT-R Word Attack and TOWRE Phonemic Decoding Efficiency), and for two measures of spelling from dictation (WRAT-3 Spelling and, to a lesser extent, WIAT Spelling). These measures are thus good candidates for more sophisticated segregation analyses that can formulate models for incorporation into linkage analyses."

particularly during late childhood with the pending transition to high school and subsequent
increase in academic demands. Research suggests that it is important for children in late
childhood to achieve academically not only to aid their learning as schooling progresses,
but also to reduce the likelihood of a range of short and long-term negative outcomes.
Factors which affect academic performance have been explored in previous
research, however there has been limited research attention given to how children’s
relationships in late childhood may influence academic outcomes. While it is recognised
that parents and teachers play important roles in children’s lives, and that teachers play a
leading role in relation to children’s acquisition of academic skills and knowledge, the level
of influence these key relationships have on academic performance scores in late childhood
is largely unknown.
The current study investigated the effect of Child-Parent and Child-Teacher

Difficulties in phonological coding have been shown to be a core deficit in children with dyslexia. In addition, there exists a large corpus of research indicating a variety of deficits in sensorimotor performance.

By applying propensity score matching, we found a positive effect of reading on the language abilities of preschool children and of students at the end of primary school. Additionally, a high frequency of reading to children in early childhood positively affects their own reading behavior. However, differences in reading in early childhood appear to be unrelated to school marks in the subject of German language at the end of primary school. Furthermore, we found no long-term effects of reading among secondary school leavers.

63,197661741,the development of a community based survey methodology for use with children with oral communication impairment,2002,,,Diane Patrice Keating,"BACKGROUND: Oral communication impairments (OCIs) are a common childhood problem with often long-term negative outcomes for both the child and society. Despite the growing body of knowledge about the epidemiology of this problem, the shift from traditional treatment approaches to population based approaches to management has been slow. One suggested reason for this is a lack of community based population data on such problems with which to plan services more broadly. AIM: The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the population knowledge of children with OCIs by developing and trialing a data collection method at a community level. LITERATURE REVIEW: One of the major issues in understanding OCIs from a population perspective is the disparate and often incongruent nature of epidemiological data reported in the literature. Five areas of epidemiological research were reviewed in order to critically evaluate the existing evidence base and identify gaps for further research. The five areas reviewed were: Prevalence (Regardless of the methodology used to collect prevalence data, OCIs have been described as a common childhood problem), Life Course (Children with OCIs often have ongoing communication problems and are at risk for poorer life outcomes in social, educational and occupational domains), Comorbidities (OCIs rarely occur in isolation and most children will have other developmental or health issues), Risk factors (There is no one easily definable cause of OCIs, however, genetic and environmental factors appear to increase the risk of OCI in the general population), and Service use (Only around half of children with recognised OCIs will access specialist intervention services).The review concluded that local community data measuring the 'burden', or impact, of the problem, comorbidities and service use in children with and without OCIs would assist in service planning. Therefore a methodology would need to be developed which addressed these issues.A further review of the literature considered this methodology development with specific reference to the issues of study design, sampling and identification of OCIs. The review concluded that a cross-sectional survey design of a community sample could provide the necessary data. Parent and teacher report was suggested as a method for identifying OCIs in surveys, however, a tool needed to be developed and trialed to ensure this method was effective, valid and reliable. PILOT STUDY: A survey tool for parents was designed which included the Child Health Questionnaire (PF - 28), questions relating to socio-demographic features, health and development conditions, service use and specifically developed questions regarding OCIs. The survey methodology was trialed in one school and one childcare centre. The results of the study were reviewed and suggestions made for methodological changes before a community trial was carried out. The reliability and validity of the questions designed to identify OCIs was assessed in a number of ways. Test-retest reliability of parent completed questionnaires proved to be good. Interrater reliability was examined by comparing parent and teacher responses. Parents and teachers agreed on identification of OCI in over 75% of cases for each of the OCIs studied. Criterion validity was assessed by comparing parent report to speech pathologist evaluation in a clinical sample and by comparing parent and teacher report to screening assessments of communication skills in a school sample. Both parents and teachers tended to over-identify children, however, when parent and teacher reports were considered together the validity approached that of the 'gold standard'. Construct validity was assessed by comparing reported OCIs with reports of other developmental conditions known to be commonly comorbid with OCIs. Once again using both parent and teacher report proved to be the most valid method of identifying OCIs using the developed tool. COMMUNITY STUDY: A targeted community survey of 3 to 7 year old children was conducted in a regional centre in Queensland, Australia. Children were sampled through schools and childcare centres. Information letters were distributed to the parents of 898 eligible children. Completed questionnaires were received for 397 children. Teachers completed questionnaires on 375 children which was 42% of the population sampled. Parents and teachers identified OCIs in 16% of the children. However, only 3% of the population were rated by parents or teachers as having severe problems. Over 70% of parents and teachers of children with a reported OCI rated the problem as having an impact on the child's life. Ratings of impact were not related to parent/teacher ratings of severity. Children with OCIs were reported to have significantly more health, developmental and behaviour problems than their peers. Children with OCIs were rated lower by their parents on most aspects of the Child Health Questionnaire (PF-28). In particular, parents reported impacts on their own time and family activities due to the child's problems. No significant differences were found between children with and without reported OCIs on any of the socio-demographic variables studied. Children with reported OCIs used more health and educational services than their peers. Around 60% of children with reported OCIs had seen a speech pathologist, but many parents had also sought advice from a range of other health and educational professionals. Those with two or more OCI conditions were more likely to have seen a professional, however socio-demographic variables did not generally predict service use. Parents reported that the type of service they chose was most commonly influenced by advice from a doctor or teacher. The limitations of this methodology for collecting this type of data are discussed. However despite these limitations data were collected which has major implications for the provision of population based services for children with OCI. CONCLUSION: This thesis has contributed to the understanding of children with OCIs by researching the development of a methodology to study this problem in a defined community sample. The information gained from the literature review and the community study were considered within two models of service provision. The models encompass service delivery from individualised to more population based approaches to the management of OCIs in children. From these models, specific suggestions for the community involved in the study were discussed. This thesis, therefore, provided a survey methodology that is resource efficient in the collection of community data useful in suggesting improved services for children with oral communication impairments."

Our sample included 455 kinder- garten and first-grade children who are enrolled in the Western Reserve Reading Project. We go on to test whether these associations are moderated by maternal reading ability. Results suggest that the degree of household order is significantly and positively associated with the expressive vocabulary, Woodcock Reading Mastery, and phonological awareness skills of children whose mothers are above-average readers. By contrast, the number of books a child owns or brings home and how often a child amuses self alone with books are significantly asso- ciated with the expressive vocabulary, Woodcock Reading Mastery, and phono- logical awareness skills of children whose mothers are average-ability readers. These results suggest the potential for new approaches to encouraging literacy development in the home beyond those that depend solely on parental literacy."
73,307583642,expanding understanding of emergent literacy empirical support for a new framework,2007,,Journal of Visual Impairment & Blindness,"Karen A. Erickson, Deborah D. Hatton","Abstract: Emergent literacy in young children with visual impairments is examined using a conceptual framework proposed by Senechal, LeFevre, Smith-Chant, and Colton (2001). The utility of this framework for young children with visual impairments is illustrated using data from a field study of preschool classes for children with visual impairments. ********** Relatively little is known about the development of language and literacy in children with visual impairments (that is, those who are blind or have low vision). The research that has been conducted suggests that these children are at risk of experiencing delays in the development of language and literacy (Bigelow, 1987; Fraiberg, 1977; Preisler, 1995; Urwin, 1984). From early ages, children who are visually impaired show delays or differences in babbling (Fraiberg, 1977); speaking in one- and two-word combinations (McConachie, 1990; McConachie & Moore, 1994); and in using language (Anderson, Dunlea, & Kekelis, 1984; Bigelow, 1987; Sapp, 2001; Urwin, 1984). Furthermore, differences have been found between children with visual impairments and other children with respect to the frequency of reading storybooks and engaging in other literacy learning experiences (Stratton & Wright, 1991), as well as general opportunities to explore the world (Wormsley & D'Andrea, 1997). It appears that limited incidental learning through pictures, television, print in the environment, or events that occur silently in learning environments (Koenig & Farrenkopf, 1997) influences the language and literacy learning of children who are visually impaired. As interest in understanding emergent literacy for children with visual impairments continues to increase, it seems important to develop or adopt a conceptual framework to guide both research and practice. Starting with a well-defined conceptual model will provide researchers and practitioners with a common language and conceptual understanding from which they can develop a model that will best fit the characteristics of literacy and of language learners who are visually impaired. Whether the field of visual impairment and blindness eventually chooses to adopt a conceptual framework that is developed to explain the development of literacy for sighted children or to create one of its own will depend largely on the fit between these models and the growing evidence base. In this article, we describe a conceptual framework of emergent literacy that was developed for sighted children and provide initial evidence of its applicability to children who are visually impaired using data that were collected in a field study that investigated literacy practices for young children with visual impairments in preschool settings. Emergent literacy The conceptual framework described here was selected because it encompasses a holistic understanding of emergent and early literacy that incorporates all aspects of written and oral language (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkinson, 1985; Clay, 1966, 1979; Teale & Sulzby, 1986). Furthermore, it encompasses the extant definitions of emergent literacy for young children who are visually impaired (D'Andrea & Farrenkopf, 2000; Stratton & Wright, 1991) and the specific practices for promoting emergent literacy that have been recommended in the literature (Swenson, 1999; Wormsley, 1997). The conceptual framework was also selected because it provides a description of the constructs underlying emergent and early literacy, rather than of the behavioral indicators or components of emergent literacy that are described in other models (see Mason & Stewart, 1990; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). This distinction is important, given the likelihood that there will be substantial behavioral differences in the demonstration of an increasing knowledge of literacy by young sighted children and those with visual impairments, particularly those who will read braille. …"
74,308073433,home literacy practices in diverse families parental involvement in kindergarten children s literacy development,2013,,,Lauren Gonzalez,"Although prior research has shown that parental involvement positively affects a child's literacy development, attention should also be directed to the factors that keep parents from being involved in their children's education. The study reported in this dissertation examined five factors: socioeconomic status, level of education, employment, culture, and language that may be influential in parental assistance of their children's literacy development in the home. The data sources for this investigation included interview responses and a demographic survey. Data from 17 parents, each from a different household, and each with a child in kindergarten were obtained and used for the study. For analyses of these data, content analysis was used to identify similar themes among the interview responses and the demographic survey. Results indicated the following: (1) the time parents spent assisting their child with literacy activities was affected by long work hours, (2) parents with a yearly income of $25,000 or less were unable to provide additional literacy materials for their children, (3) lack of multicultural literature caused culturally diverse parents to feel devalued, and (4) parents who did not speak English fluently lacked the strategies to assist their children in completing English literacy homework. The findings suggest there are significant factors in the home environment that impact the quality and amount of literacy activities that parents provide for their children. In order for teachers to support parents in providing for their children's literacy development, they need to be aware of these factors. In addition, teachers should be culturally sensitive by including multicultural literature in the curriculum."

Georgiou","Abstract We examined (a) the cross-lagged relationships between the home learning environment and academic achievement in Chinese, and (b) whether parents’ socioeconomic status (SES) and child's gender moderate the relations. One hundred seventy-seven Chinese children were followed from Grade 1 to Grade 2 and were assessed on reading and mathematics. Their parents also responded to a questionnaire assessing the frequency of engaging in different home literacy and numeracy activities. Results showed that reading ability in Grade 1 negatively predicted informal home literacy activities in Grade 2. In turn, mathematics ability in Grade 1 negatively predicted formal home numeracy activities in Grade 2. Neither parents’ SES nor child's gender moderated any of the observed cross-lagged relationships. These findings suggest first that different facets of the home learning environment may relate to reading and mathematics in Chinese. Second, once children go to Grade 1, the relationship between home learning environment and academic achievement becomes unidirectional: early reading/mathematics ability predicts future home literacy/numeracy activities and the effect is negative. This suggests that parents engage more frequently in home activities when they notice that their children experience difficulties in reading or mathematics. However, it is also possible that parents change their teaching in order to be in accord with the expectations of the school system."

Students in the treatment condition received daily, comprehensive reading instruction in small groups of 1-4 students for approximately 40 minutes per session. A broad array of measures was studied, including phonemic awareness, phonics, word recognition, comprehension, and oral language. Means favored the intervention group on all measures, with moderate to strong effect sizes. Statistically significant differences were found on most measures, including phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, and comprehension. These findings demonstrated that students with moderate ID can learn basic reading skills given consistent, explicit, and comprehensive reading instruction across an extended period of time."

Bierman","Abstract Two-hundred preschool children in Head Start (55% girls; 20% Hispanic, 25% African-American, 55% European American; M age = 4.80 years old) participated in a randomized-controlled trial of a home visiting intervention designed to promote emergent literacy skills (the Research-based Developmentally Informed parent [REDI-P] program). This study explored concurrent changes in levels of parent support and child literacy skills that occurred over the course of the intervention, and examined the impact of pre-intervention parent support and child literacy skills as potential moderators of parent and child outcomes. Cross-lagged structural equation models and follow-up analyses indicated that intervention had the strongest impact on child literacy skills when parents were high on support at the pre-intervention assessment. Conversely, the REDI-Parent program promoted the greatest gains in parent support when parents entered the program with low levels of support. These findings suggest that families may benefit from home visiting school readiness interventions in different ways: child skill acquisition may be greatest when parents are initially high in support, whereas parenting may improve most when parents are initially low in support."

In this study, of the 8 boys, all except one had been pushed to extremes of misery during primary school, and he had temporarily emigrated. All had been teased, humiliated, and insulted by staff, children, or both. There were five examples of extreme violence from teachers, three of which occurred under the age of nine. Of those who had not been physically attacked by teachers who could not cope, there was evidence of truancy, total demoralization, psychosomatic pains, and isolation, in addition to the risk of permanent physical damage being done while inducing artificial sickness. The boys registered a great deal of intensity, pain, or embarrassment in recalling the worst incidents, which showed in voice, gesture, eyes, increased colour, feeling hot, drawing odd doodles, or coffee consumption. The students in this study had all had years of intensive specialist help, yet their reported experiences make it clear that teachers also need to bear in mind the importance of individual reactions to failure. It is clear from this study that the type of educational failure experienced by these boys not only scars the personality but can also have damaging side behavioral side effects."

Lombardino","This study was designed to investigate potential reading differences between low-achieving and typically achieving first-grade Korean-speaking children by (1) comparing their speed of lexical access on alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric tests of rapid automatized naming and (2) comparing relationships between the two groups’ performance on alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric tasks with their performance on component measures of reading. Twenty-seven low-achieving readers and 34 typically achieving readers participated in this study. The low-achieving readers performed significantly more slowly than their typically achieving reading peers on the four measures of rapid naming. The response rates for both alphanumeric naming tasks (digits and letters) showed strong negative correlations with oral reading fluency, while their response rates for the non-alphanumeric naming tasks (Color and Object naming) showed relatively weak relationships with reading measures for both groups. In regression equations, Letter naming tasks were uniquely associated with both word recognition and oral reading fluency. The utility of using alphanumeric naming tasks as indicators for identifying Korean Hangul readers who are at risk for reading disabilities is discussed."

This chapter discusses research-generated inclusionary criteria for defining dyslexia in children and adults. Writing disabilities, in particular, are under-diagnosed and under-treated and may be an unrecognized contributor to academic failure and school drop-out rates. The International Dyslexia Association (IDA) defines dyslexia as a specific learning disability characterized by unexpected difficulty in accuracy and rate of decoding, word reading and text reading, and spelling. Exclusionary criteria prevent confusion of dyslexia with reading problems having other biological causes. The University of Washington (UW) research team conducted confirmatory factor analyses to evaluate the measurement model based on latent traits underlying multiple indicators or measures of the same process. Current school assessment practices focus on making educational decisions about whether children qualify for special education services rather than on making differential diagnoses. Insufficient attention is given to etiology of reading problems, linking assessment to research-supported effective instruction, and prognosis for long-range outcomes."
103,1104101878,order short term memory capacity predicts nonword reading and spelling in first and second grade,2016,10.1007/s11145-015-9577-9,Reading and Writing,"Florence Binamé, Martine Poncelet","Recent theories of short-term memory (STM) distinguish between item information, which reflects the temporary activation of long-term representations stored in the language system, and serial-order information, which is encoded in a specific representational system that is independent of the language network. Some studies examining the relationship between reading acquisition and verbal STM for order and item information separately in beginning readers have found that order STM capacity is independently predictive of nonword decoding abilities in first grade, but item STM is not. In this longitudinal study, we first aimed to explore whether this finding also holds for nonword spelling abilities. We also sought to determine whether order STM capacity remains an independent predictor of nonword decoding and spelling abilities in the second year of reading instruction. For this purpose, 70 typically developing children were followed over 3 years, from kindergarten to second grade. In kindergarten, children were administered order and item STM tasks and phonological awareness tasks, in addition to tasks assessing letter name knowledge, vocabulary knowledge, and nonverbal reasoning. In first and second grades, the children’s word and nonword reading and spelling abilities were assessed. The results revealed that order STM capacity was a robust independent predictor of nonword reading and spelling abilities in first and second grade, but was not related to the abilities to read and spell words. The specific role of order STM in the acquisition of the sublexical reading and spelling routes is discussed."

Pour cela, nous avons realise trois series d'observations de dyades assistante maternelle-enfant filmees au cours de differentes situations d'echanges. Une grille d'analyse repertoriant les interventions des assistantes maternelles et des enfants sur les unites a ete mise en place et validee, puis des epreuves evaluant certaines competences chez les enfants ont ete elaborees. D'apres les resultats, les interventions des assistantes maternelles sur les unites pourraient jouer un role dans l'emergence des habiletes phonologiques, 1) soit de facon directe, en incitant l'enfant a en produire lui-meme, 2) soit de facon indirecte, en favorisant le developpement du vocabulaire et la precision des representations phonologiques des enfants. Enfin, un dispositif que nous avons cree, l'ORLeP, indique que les interventions des assistantes maternelles seraient guidees par certaines de leurs representations a propos des pratiques de lecture. Cet outil est a la base d'un dispositif de formation a distance en cours d'elaboration, permettant de sensibiliser les adultes a differentes facons d'interagir avec l'enfant et de les encourager a s'interroger sur leurs pratiques."

Four are highlighted here. First, semantic radicals are one aspect of Chinese characters that have no analogy to alphabetic orthographies. Second, the unreliability of phonological cues in Chinese along with the fact that word building relies heavily on lexical compounding in Chinese makes morphological awareness particularly important for early reading development. Third, two different scripts (simplified, traditional) have different characteristics and strengths and weaknesses in relation to teaching and learning Chinese. Fourth, learning Chinese may strengthen both segmental and suprasegmental phonological sensitivity and even promote basic visual skills, potential cognitive advantages. Collectively, these aspects of Chinese make it important to consider as a unique orthography for understanding universals and specifics in the process of learning to read and write."

However, there is limited research on the differential effects of the WM components (central executive, phonological loop, visual-spatial sketchpad) on WPS, and how speed, reading, calculation, and knowledge of word problem components mediate that relationship. The sample consisted of 413 between ages 6-10 (M = 8.38, SD = .51). The results yielded three important findings: 1) without any mediators, the phonological loop was the best predictor of WPS; 2) when other variables were entered into the model, reading and calculation were the strongest direct predictors of WPS; 3) results of the mediation model showed that speed mediated the relationship between the central executive component of WM and WPS, while reading mediated the relationship between the central executive and phonological loop and WPS. The educational implications of these findings are discussed."

113,1483701737,language literacy and identity practices influencing acculturation in immigrant migrant nepalese families an ethnographic study,2013,,,Nettie Boivin,"This thesis is an ethnographic study which investigates the practices of language maintenance and ethnic identity affiliation for immigrant/migrant Nepalese families with primary to middle school children in the United Kingdom. The thesis investigates the connection between two larger fields of research; language maintenance and ethnic identity affiliation. Previously, research investigated one area or the other. After initial interviews with the family members it was determined from investigation into past exposure and present participation in the various practices of both ethnic identity and language maintenance that deeper investigation needed to occur. Finally, it was determined that in the prior research none had examined differences between family members and reasons for these variations. 


The thesis presents an ethnographic comparative case study analysis of three Nepalese families using a three-tiered macro, micro, and internal theoretical framework in conjunction with a newly redefined acculturation continuum. Observation, which was participatory, occurred in various contexts during a nine month period. In conjunction with these observation sessions, semi-structured interviews regarding present participation in language maintenance and ethnic identity practices, and historical narrative interviews investigating prior exposure to home country, ethnic, cultural, and social literacy practices occurred. In addition, data analysis from the observations used a language maintenance practice checklist based on three types of practices (social language, social literacy, and peripheral ritualised practices) thus discovering whether shifts or loss occurred in families. This analysis revealed a newly termed practice of peripheral ritualised practices. Furthermore, observations discovered that it was not only exposure to home country experience and ethnic customs which play a significant role in shaping social and ethnic identity construction but more informatively the age of exposure. Consequently, the researcher was able to examine not only shifts from children via pre-adolescences to teens, but to assess differences between siblings, an area that had previously not been researched. Finally, the study noted that for children, pre-adolescence and adolescences there is a balance between globalised practices and ethnic practices which need further future investigation."

The review also notes that there is a wide range in the methods used to identify children and it goes on to recommend that there needs to be a more systematic approach. One such approach would be to screen children before, or shortly after, school entry. The GAPS test has been designed as a screening tool to identify young children with language impairment and is reported to be of value in identifying children with language difficulties. However, the test has previously only been evaluated by its authors and the sensitivity of the test for identifying children from an unselected sample has not been evaluated.

Aims: This study evaluated the ability of the GAPS test to identify language-impaired children in an unselected sample. In addition, the effect of tester status (a trained researcher and a teaching assistant) was investigated.

Methods & Procedures: A total of 106 children aged 3–6 years completed the GAPS test, the Early Repetition Battery (ERB) and the core language scales from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals—Preschool 2 with a trained researcher. Half the children completed the GAPS test a second time with a teaching assistant.

Outcomes & Results: There was a significant effect of tester only for the non-word repetition subtest of the GAPS test in the nursery age group; the teaching assistants awarded higher scores than trained researchers. Of the 106 children, ten were language impaired according to the CELF-Preschool 2 core language score. The GAPS test identified two of these children at the 10th percentile cut-off, resulting in a low sensitivity estimate of 20%. However, the GAPS test only identified four of the 96 remaining unimpaired children resulting in a high specificity value of 96%. These values were similar when the 15th percentile cut-off was used and when parental concern or a family history of reading difficulties were used as the criterion measure.

Conclusions & Implications: These data show that although the GAPS test can be used by a range of people who work with young children, it is not a sensitive screener for language impairment when used by trained researchers."

However, contextual cues may draw young children's attention away from the print, thus questioning the value of environmental print in early reading development. Eye tracker technology was used to measure the extent that children attend to words in environmental print. The relationships between print fixations and letter and word knowledge, as well as differences in fixations across types of environmental print, were also examined. Preschool children (N = 39) ages 3–5 years viewed photographs of nine environmental print items and their standard print equivalents while visual fixations were recorded. Children were found to attend to words in environmental print, although they showed more and longer fixations for standard print words without contextual cues. Children's fixations were not associated with print knowledge. However, fixations on words in environmental print varied by item type to suggest that print learning may be facilitated by using environmental print with larger and more centralized fonts.

El texto ambiental, como los letreros y las etiquetas, consta tanto del texto como de una senal contextual disenada para atraer la atencion visual del lector. Sin embargo, las senales contextuales pueden distraer la atencion de los ninos del texto en si, poniendo en tela de juicio el valor del texto ambiental en el desarrollo temprano de la habilidad de leer. Se uso la tecnologia de seguir los movimientos oculares para medir cuanto tiempo los ninos se fijaban en las letras en textos ambientales. La relacion entre el tiempo que pasaron fijandose en las letras y el conocimiento de letras y palabras, al igual que las diferencias a traves de diferentes tipos de textos ambientales, tambien fueron examinadas. Ninos pre escolares (N = 39) de entre 3 y 5 anos vieron fotos de nueve textos ambientales y sus equivalentes textuales estandar mientras se grababa su fijacion. Se encontro que los ninos le ponian atencion a las palabras en textos ambientales, aunque mostraron fijarse mas y por mas tiempo a los textos impresos sin senales contextuales. La fijacion de los ninos no tiene relacion a su conocimiento de letras. Sin embargo, la fijacion en las palabras en textos ambientales variaba de acuerdo al tipo de item y sugiere que el aprendizaje de letras podria ser facilitado usando textos ambientales con letras mas grandes y centralizadas.

In particular, it examines whether letter-name knowledge facilitates the learning of spellings in which the names of one or more letters can be heard in the pronunciation of the words. Preschool children who could not read any word out of context were divided into two groups on the basis of their ability to name the letters of the alphabet: one group knew the names of the letters while the other did not. Both groups were taught to read two types of simplified spellings: visual spellings, that is, spellings whose letters did not correspond to sounds in the pronunciations of the words but which were visually more salient (e.g., XQKO for the word ‘cerveja’), and phonetic spellings, that is, spellings whose letters corresponded to sounds in the pronunciation of the words (e.g., CRVA for the word ‘cerveja’). In all phonetic spellings, the name of at least one letter could be clearly heard in the pronunciation of the words. Results corroborated Ehri's hypothesis. The children who did not know the names of the letters learned to read the visual spellings more easily than the phonetic ones. On the other hand, the children who knew the names of the letters showed the opposite pattern, that is, they learned the phonetic spellings more easily than the visual ones."

Children are shaped in part by their environment and one rich in communication is therefore beneficial. Activities such as play and reading have long lasting positive effects on development. This study examined the social and demographic characteristics of mothers who play with, read to and tell stories to their child, using data from the UK-wide Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).

Methods
The study included 14 034 mothers of singleton 5-year-old children. Using data from the first and third sweeps of the MCS, we examined how often mothers engaged with their child in playing, reading and telling stories, according to their social and demographic characteristics: ethnicity, socio-economic status, highest academic qualification, lone mother status, age at birth of cohort child, number of children and employment status. Adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted using Stata.

Results
When their children were 5 years old, 22% of mothers reported playing, 51% reading and 13% telling stories everyday. Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Black mothers were significantly less likely to play with their child at least weekly compared with White mothers. The same applied to lone mothers compared with those living with a partner. Mothers with academic qualifications lower than degree level were less likely to read at least once weekly. Compared with mothers who worked full-time, those who worked part-time, were ‘on-leave’ or unemployed, were more likely to play with, and read to, their child at least weekly. Mothers with more than one child were significantly less likely to engage at least weekly in any of the three activities studied.

Conclusions
We found significant inequalities in the frequency of playing, reading and telling stories according to sociodemographic characteristics. This information is important to be able to target more effectively vulnerable children using established public health initiatives, like ‘Bookstart’ and ‘Surestart’, aimed at promoting play, reading and story telling."

However, very little research examines the lexical properties and their relationship with literacy acquisition in Malay, a transparent alphabetic orthography. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the relationship between the lexical and sub-lexical qualities in Malay words and kindergarten children’s decoding and spelling acquisition. The study involved Malay native speaker kindergarten children from an urban city in West Malaysia. The results converged with previous studies on consistent and shallow orthographies but offered an alternative perspective on the contribution of sub-lexical properties in Malay orthography in relation to kindergarten children’s literacy acquisition. Pedagogical implication for the design of an early literacy intervention programme was discussed, highlighting a combination of a coarse-grained and fine-grained approach in teaching the multisyllabic language with salient syllable structure.

The first study described the HLE of 4-year-old FR children. Two distinct factors were identified: storybook exposure and direct instruction of orthographic forms. The amount of interactional literacy-related input that FR and TD children received at home was broadly equivalent. 
Second, the relationship of the early HLE to language and emergent literacy skills both concurrently and longitudinally (at age 5) was investigated. Storybook exposure predicted a wider range of child outcomes than previous research has suggested. Notably, a relationship between storybook exposure and phoneme awareness emerged later for FR than TD children. Direct instruction predicted children’s decoding skills in the first year of school. A pair of path models predicting decoding and reading comprehension skills at age 6 revealed multiple indirect pathways from early HLE to reading outcomes two years later. The magnitude of several longitudinal relationships was larger for FR than TD children. A direct pathway from early storybook exposure to reading comprehension was identified in the FR group only. Effects of family SES on reading outcomes were fully mediated by the HLE variables and oral language.
In an observation study, the linguistic and socio-emotional quality of shared storybook interactions was found to be equivalent between FR and TD mother-child dyads. Children’s orientation to print at age 4 predicted word reading ability a year later, and interactional affective quality predicted children’s oral language skills. These findings are discussed, with a focus on the potential for rich early literacy-related experiences in the home to act as a protective factor in the literacy development of children at elevated risk of reading difficulty."

The spelling errors of 52 children with histories of speech sound disorders were analyzed to predict the association between weaknesses in expressive language skills in early childhood and school-age spelling abilities. Results revealed that children with preschool speech sound and language problems became poorer spellers at school age than did children with preschool speech sound disorders only. However, even children with isolated speech sound disorders demonstrated a weakness in spelling skills relative to their reading and language abilities and Weschler Performance IQ. Measures of phonological awareness were highly correlated with spelling skills, suggesting that phonological processing abilities are related to the ability to spell phonetically predictable words. Analysis of spelling errors based on level of phonological awareness skill revealed that children with preschool speech sound disorders utilize phonetic strategies in spelling phonetically predictable words. Familial aggregation of spelling disorders suggests a possible genetic component that is modified by gender."

Dockrell","Background & Aims: In order to understand better the lexical access abilities in children with word-finding difficulties, the extent of serial naming speed difficulties in these children as well as the degree to which serial and discrete naming tasks are related to one another and to literacy abilities was investigated. This enabled some of the predictions made in the double-deficit hypothesis of Wolf and Bowers to be tested.

 Methods & Procedures: Eighteen children with word-finding difficulties completed naming and literacy tasks at 8;6 years and literacy tasks at 9;8 years.

 Outcomes & Results: Children with word-finding difficulties had very slow serial naming, despite their non-verbal and literacy abilities often being in the typical range. Serial and discrete naming speeds were not closely related. The performance on serial naming tasks that involved alphanumeric items provided the strongest correlations with decoding and reading comprehension.

 Conclusions & Implications: Discrete and serial naming tasks appear to assess different aspects of lexical access, and only partial support was obtained for the double-deficit hypothesis. The findings also suggest that a reason for the correlation between the children's serial naming speed for letters/digits and their literacy could be because both are structurally similar tasks."

Three basic components were extracted in a principal component analysis: a phoneme factor, a syllable factor and a rhyme factor. Cross-tabulations indicated considerable dissociation between performance on phoneme, syllable, and rhyme tasks. The structural relationships were replicated on a much larger sample (n=1509) in the second study. Subjects in this study were one year older and were attending grade 1 thus providing an opportunity to test their reading achievement. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that the phonemic factor was by far the most potent predictor. However, the rhyming factor made an independent (although small) contribution to explaining the reading variance. Among the phonemic tasks, phoneme identification proved to be the most powerful predictor."

Leonard, Patricia Deevy","Background

In many languages a weakness in non-word repetition serves as a useful clinical marker of specific language impairment (SLI) in children. However, recent work in Italian has shown that the repetition of real words may also have clinical utility. For young typically developing Italian children, real word repetition is more predictive of particular grammatical abilities than is non-word repetition. This finding is important because these particular grammatical abilities—the production of present-tense third-person plural inflections and direct-object clitic pronouns—are precisely those that are problematic for Italian-speaking children with SLI. Along with their grammatical requirements, these two morpheme types present a significant phonological/prosodic challenge for these children.



Aims

To replicate the findings with young typically developing Italian children and to determine whether real word repetition is also more predictive of the use of these two morpheme types than is non-word repetition in a group of Italian-speaking children with SLI.



Methods & Procedures

Seventeen Italian-speaking children with SLI and 17 younger typically developing children matched for mean length of utterance participated in tasks of real word and non-word repetition as well as tasks requiring the production of direct-object clitic pronouns and present-tense third-person plural inflections.



Outcomes & Results

Children with SLI were less accurate than their younger peers on all measures. Importantly, for the younger typically developing children, real word repetition explained a significant amount of variance in the use of third-person plural inflections and direct-object clitic pronouns. For the children with SLI, in contrast, non-word repetition was a significant predictor, whereas real word repetition was not a contributing factor.



Conclusions & Implications

It is argued that in Italian SLI, the grammatical details showing the greatest weakness present phonological/prosodic obstacles as well as grammatical challenges to these children. Consequently, non-word repetition emerges as a predictor of these grammatical weaknesses in SLI, unlike the profile observed in typically developing Italian children."

The rationale is that the development of reading and language skills is intertwined and therefore cannot be separated in a meaningful way. Two groups were formed, based on scores obtained from administering standardised language tests. The first group consisted of pupils with expressive/receptive language difficulties (E/RLD) and the second group included pupils with normally developing language skills (Non‐E/RLD). Neither group had a diagnosis of dyslexia. It was found that pupils with E/RLD performed poorly on reading comprehension tasks compared with peers who do not experience language difficulties. Evidence from this study stresses the importance of the role of speech and language therapy with pupils with language and reading difficulties."

In 103 Korean third-grade children, we tested ability to read and spell, nonverbal intelligence, vocabulary size, phonological cognitive processing, visual cognitive processing, and naming speed. Our results indicated that receptive vocabulary, phoneme awareness, and naming speed served as factors for predicting reading test score; receptive vocabulary served as a factor for predicting spelling test score. We found that low reading-level groups had significantly slower performance on the naming speed task and lower scores on the receptive vocabulary test, as compared with the other groups (average and high reading-level groups).

An academic achievement test was administered to 129 children with mild or moderate ID when they were 6–8 years old, as well as one and two school years later. Findings indicated that phonological awareness and letter-sound knowledge at 6–8 years of age predicted progress in word and non-word reading after one school year and two school years after controlling for IQ, age, expressive vocabulary, spoken language, and type of placement. Phonological awareness and letter-sound knowledge at 6–8 years of age also predicted progress in reading comprehension after one school year and two school years. These findings suggest that training phonological awareness skills combined with explicit phonics instruction is important to foster reading progress in children with mild and moderate ID with unspecified etiology."

Then, using a framework developed by Farmer & Klein (1995), the proposal that a temporal processing deficit (in vision, audition, or both) might be the root cause of some proportion of cases of developmental dyslexia is introduced and various research strategies for testing this proposal are identified. The symposium papers which address this general question using a range of these strategies are then critically reviewed. It is noted that whereas reading is a recent artifact not yet subject to any direct selection pressure, its normal performance requires the use of, and connections between, the highly evolved modules for visual pattern recognition and language. Within vision and language redundant coding, which permits performance in the face of injuries and degraded input, also makes it difficult to detect subtle deficits (whether temporal, or not) unless precise tests are used. Yet such deficits may degrade performance on tasks (such as reading) which require the non-copious connections between vision and language. The efficacy of this pathway, I suggest, is measured by performance on the rapid automatized naming (RAN) test."

Booth","It is unknown how experience with different types of orthographies influences the neural basis of oral language processing. In order to determine the effects of alphabetic and nonalphabetic writing systems, the current study examined the influence of learning to read on oral language in English and Chinese speakers. Children (8–12 years olds) and adults made rhyming judgments to pairs of spoken words during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Developmental increases were seen only for English speakers in the left hemisphere phonological network (superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior parietal lobule, and inferior frontal gyrus). The increase in the STG was more pronounced for words with conflicting orthography (e.g. pint-mint; jazz-has) even though access to orthography was irrelevant to the task. Moreover, higher reading skill was correlated with greater activation in the STG only for English speaking children. The effects suggest that learning to read reorganizes the phonological awareness network only for alphabetic and not logographic writing systems because of differences in the principles for mapping between orthographic and phonological representations. The reorganization of the auditory cortex may result in better phonological awareness skills in alphabetic readers."

Torgesen","One of the major risk factors for reading disability is difficulty learning to read words in text in an accurate and fluent manner. This is apparent when a child at risk of dyslexia first starts to attempt to read. Dyslexic children struggle to grasp and automate the alphabetic principle (ie, they cannot “sound out” words or use phonemic decoding strategies) and therefore have difficulty deciphering unfamiliar words that they have not encountered before. Even though many of these words are part of the child's oral vocabulary, the child cannot recognize them in printed form. As a result, reading can be extremely laborious and time-consuming, fraught with errors, and altogether an unrewarding, aversive experience. To be an efficient reader, one must be able to rapidly and effortlessly recognize many words by sight, and for a child to acquire this facility requires multiple exposures to these words. The difficulty that dyslexic children have in developing reliable and efficient phonemic decoding ability make..."

Levine, Özlem Ece Demir","A literacy-related activity that occurs in children’s homes—talk about letters in everyday conversations—was examined using data from 50 children who were visited every 4 months between 14 and 50 months. Parents talked about some letters, including those that are common in English words and the first letter of their children’s names, especially often. Parents’ focus on the child’s initial was especially strong in families of higher socioeconomic status, and the extent to which parents talked about the child’s initial during the later sessions of the study was related to the children’s kindergarten reading skill. Conversations that included the child’s initial were longer than those that did not, and parents presented a variety of information about this letter. Learning to read is crucial for success in school and life. Consequently, researchers, educators, and policy makers are interested in finding out why some children learn to read more easily than others. Part of the answer may lie in the literacy-related activities that children participate in at home, before formal reading instruction begins. These activities may include being read to by their parents, learning to spell their names, and playing with magnets in the shapes of letters. Children who are reported by their parents to engage in such activities infrequently are on average less successful in learning to read than children who are reported to engage in them often (e.g., Burgess, Hecht, & Lonigan, 2002; Christian, Morrison, & Bryant, 1998). Shared book reading is the most studied aspect of the home literacy environment, but researchers have suggested that the construct of home literacy be expanded to include other activities (e.g., Phillips & Lonigan, 2009). Here, we focus on one potentially important but understudied activity—parents’ talk about letters of the alphabet with their young children—and how this varies across families and relates to children’s later reading performance."

Moreover studies of Black parents often contain samples with minimal variation in educational attainment. The purpose of this study was to identify the potential role of educational attainment in predicting parenting differences within the Black community. This study focused on home literacy promotion and parent involvement in school, two parenting practices often associated with children’s academic achievement. The sample consisted of 103 Black parents with a wide range of educational attainment and preschool-aged children enrolled in urban child care centers. The results suggest that attainment of at least a Bachelor’s degree is associated with a richer home literacy environment but the same pattern was not evident for parent involvement in school.

To address the research goals, a nationally representative sample of Head Start children, the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (2003 cohort), was used for analysis. The children were aged 3–4 years at programme entry. The mothers' average age at programme entry was 39 years old. A parallel process model was utilized to examine the growth factors of joint book reading and receptive vocabulary in parallel. Three significant findings emerged: (1) initial levels of English receptive vocabulary and joint book reading positively covaried; (2) English receptive vocabulary and joint book reading were positively and reciprocally related to each other; and (3) slopes for joint book reading and English receptive vocabulary negatively covaried. Results suggest that joint book reading can support and scaffold Head Start children's English receptive vocabulary. Reciprocally, Head Start children's English receptive vocabulary appears to predict the extent to which they engage in joint book reading at home. Moreover, the frequency of joint book reading decreases as the children demonstrate higher levels of English receptive vocabulary. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The performance of 26 self-reported dyslexic adults was compared with that of a comparison group of 47 adults with no history of reading or spelling difficulties. Participants completed standardized and experimental measures tapping literacy skills, working memory, phonological awareness and rapid naming. Spelling problems were the most prominent marker of dyslexia in adults, followed by text reading fluency and nonword decoding. Working memory and phoneme awareness explained unique variance in spelling, whereas rapid automatized naming explained unique variance in reading fluency and nonword reading. The moderate to strong correlations between self-reported history, self-rating of current literacy skills and outcomes on literacy tests indicate that adults estimated their literacy skills fairly well. Results suggest that spelling impairments, more strongly than reading impairments, make adults perceive themselves as being dyslexic. A combination of three literacy and three cognitive tests predicted group membership with 90.4% accuracy. It appears that weaknesses in phoneme awareness, rapid automatized naming and working memory are strong and persistent correlates of literacy problems even in adults learning a relatively transparent orthography.

To explore the link between pre-school children's general home computer use and their letter knowledge.



Methods

As part of the Early Language in Victoria Study, a community cohort of 1539 four-year-old children was tested on letter knowledge as well as on non-verbal intelligence, oral language, articulation and phonological awareness. Performance on these measures was examined in relation to parent-questionnaire responses exploring home literacy environment and the amount of time children spent using the computer.



Results

A positive correlation between computer use and letter knowledge was found, and this association was still evident after controlling for other cognitive and environmental factors known to predict the development of letter knowledge in young children.



Conclusions

Greater computer use in pre-school children appears to have a positive association with emerging literacy development. Future research needs to examine the nature of that association."

183,1600705343,early literacy development in mandarin speaking children the role ofphonological awareness rapid naming and spoken language skills,2012,,,Lili Yeh,"In Taiwan, many children grow up in a bilingual environment, namely Mandarin and Taiwanese. They learn Zhuyin Fuhao – a semi-syllabic transparent orthography – at the beginning of the first grade before learning traditional Chinese characters. However little is known about the acquisition of literacy in this complex context, especially about the role of phonological awareness (PA), rapid automatized naming (RAN) and other spoken language skills. This longitudinal study is the first systematic attempt to investigate the trajectory of literacy acquisition in Mandarin-speaking children and the impact of instruction in both Zhuyin Fuhao and character. 

The study was carried out in Taipei. A sample of 92 children were tested in their first grade (mean age of 6;7), and then followed up a year later in their second grade. A comprehensive PA battery was designed to measure implicit and explicit PA of syllables, onset-rime, phonemes and tones. RAN, spoken language skills and literacy skills, including reading accuracy and comprehension in Zhuyin Fuhao and character were also measured, alongside non-verbal intelligence and children’s home languages.

It was found that the role of PA in early literacy development of Mandarin-speaking children in Taiwan varies as a function of the orthography system. PA was closely linked to ZF-related tasks and reading comprehension, but not character reading where it had no predictive role. On the other hand, graphological RAN was found to be a good predictor of reading performance in both scripts, both concurrently and longitudinally. Additionally, non-graphological RAN had a role in predicting lexical-related literacy skills. Lastly, all spoken language skills, except semantic fluency, were significantly associated with reading comprehension indicating that oral language competence contributes major variances in reading comprehension. Moreover, vocabulary and auditory memory were associated longitudinally with many CH-related tasks. However, the variance of ZF word reading or spelling could not be explained by any spoken language skills. Investigation of children with atypical development revealed that children with reading difficulties performed less well on RAN and PA tasks while children with speech difficulty performed less well on sub-syllabic PA, Zhuyin Fuhao literacy tasks and character recognition, but no differently to their peers on RAN and character reading accuracy and character knowledge in radical form or position. The theoretical, methodological and practical implications of these findings are discussed."

Deze hypothese werd getoetst middels een onderzoek naar de klankwaarneming van jonge kinderen met een genetisch risico voor dyslexie en jonge kinderen met een specifieke taalontwikkelingsstoornis. De resultaten bevestigen de hypothese: beide groepen kinderen zijn minder consistent in het classificeren van spraakklanken dan de controlegroep.

Substantial evidence shows that dyslexic readers have problems with rapid naming of visual items. Early research assumed that this was a consequence of phonological processing deficits, but recent findings suggest that non-phonological processes may lie at the root of the association between slow naming speed and poor reading. The hypothesis that rapid naming reflects an independent core deficit in dyslexia is supported by the main findings: (1) some dyslexics are characterized by rapid naming difficulties but intact phonological skills; (2) evidence for an independent association between rapid naming and reading competence in the dyslexic readers, when the effect of phonological skills was controlled; (3) rapid naming and phonological processing measures are not reliably correlated. Recent research also reveals greater predictive power of rapid naming, in particular the inter-item pause time, for high-frequency word reading compared to pseudoword reading in developmental dyslexia. Altogether, the results are more consistent with the view that a phonological component alone cannot account for the rapid naming performance in dyslexia. Rather, rapid naming problems may emerge from the inefficiencies in visual-orthographic processing as well as in phonological processing."

Then I present research that has compared groups of children over the long-term as a function of whether they received early formal reading instruction or not.

As with previous research RAN letters was the best predictor of reading skills. The best model for predicting reading was based on a combined measure of PA and RAN letters. An interesting finding was that the correlation between irregular and non-word reading was significant for students with typical reading, but insignificant for the poor readers.

Children who ended up with RD despite low early cognitive risk had poorer cognitive skills, more task avoidance and they were reading less than children without RD and low cognitive risk. In summary, lack of task avoidance seemed to act as a protective factor, which underlines the importance of keeping children interested in school work and reading.

As a result, visual cognition, phonological awareness, naming speed and receptive vocabulary significantly predicted reading accuracy in children in Grades 1 and 2, whereas visual cognition, phonological awareness and rapid naming speed did not predict reading accuracy in children in higher grades. For reading, fluency, phonological awareness, rapid naming speed and receptive vocabulary were crucial abilities in children in Grades 1 to 3, whereas phonological awareness was not a significant predictor in children in Grade 4. In spelling, reading ability and receptive vocabulary were the most important abilities for accurate Hangul spelling. The results suggested that the degree of cognitive abilities required for reading and spelling changed depending on expertise and reading experience. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.



Key Messages

Phonological awareness and visual cognition were important for Hangul reading.
Receptive vocabulary was important in both Hangul reading and spelling.
Cognitive abilities are required for literacy changed during reading development."

Designed to promote sustained gains, the Research-based Developmentally Informed (REDI) Parent program (REDI-P) provided home visits before and after the kindergarten transition, giving parents evidence-based learning games, interactive stories, and guided pretend play to use with their children. To evaluate impact, two hundred 4-year-old children in Head Start REDI classrooms were randomly assigned to REDI-P or a comparison condition (mail-home math games). Beyond the effects of the classroom program, REDI-P promoted significant improvements in child literacy skills, academic performance, self-directed learning, and social competence, demonstrating the utility of the approach in promoting gains in cognitive and social-emotional skills evident after the transition into kindergarten."

Reading is a complex task involving perceptual, motor, linguistic, phonological, and memory components, each of which has a crucial role in determining reading rate. High poverty rates continue to have a negative impact on human resource development and education quality in Africa, further complicating the ability of most countries to reach the Education for All (EFA) and Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Moreover, Africa and Asia are hosts to most of the world's multilingual countries, in which textbook availability in major indigenous languages is sorely lacking. Therefore, it is important to take all possible steps to maximize the effectiveness of teaching interventions. In parallel, also the quality of textbooks is a crucial factor for quality education, especially in developing countries. It is important to dispose of well-written and well-designed textbooks, because the quality of textbook can be an important predictor of student learning and can contribute to the effective use of instructional time and classroom teaching. This review examines the evidence regarding variables influencing acquisition of decoding and comprehension reading skills. One important caveat is in order. While the educational, psychological and neuroscience literature on reading is extensive, it largely depends upon studies on English speaking individuals. The first part of the review focuses on studies of visual psychophysics and examines the visual limitations affecting reading and its development. The second part of the review draws on the psychological and neuroscience literature to examine the role of several variables influencing reading acquisition, such as letter knowledge, teaching method, teacher's competence, orthographic consistency."

Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed abnormal activity of brain regions known to subserve reading (and its constituent processes), including left ventral occipitotemporal, temporoparietal, and inferior frontal cortices. Further, functional and structural connectivity between these areas is disrupted. These findings are considered to be consistent with the behavioral phonological and orthographic processing deficits manifested by individuals with dyslexia. Brain imaging studies are contributing to our understanding of the neural correlates of successful reading intervention, as well as the link between dyslexia-associated genes and brain-based measures. Studies suggest an age-dependent neurobiological profile of dyslexia, and there is uncertainty regarding which brain differences are attributed to dyslexia per se rather than altered reading experience concomitant with dyslexia, together emphasizing the need for more longitudinal brain-based investigations into dyslexia."

Sixty-two schools with 201 kindergarten classrooms and 3,635 students in a southwestern state were randomly assigned to administer kindergarten assessment in the fall or in the winter, with teachers receiving onsite or web mentoring. A small, signifi cant effect (d = 0.13) was found for outcomes on a standardized reading test administered at the end of kindergarten when teach ers administered the screen in the fall and received web rather than onsite mentoring. A slight, nonsignificant, reduction in read ing risk (i.e., reduction in false positives) was apparent. Given these small effects, there is little empirical support for initiating screen ing in the fall rather than in the winter of kindergarten."

A quasi-experimental approach was employed with students in the treatment and control groups matched on grade and reading comprehension level. The intervention was delivered by teachers in small groups for 60 minutes three times per week over a period of 10 weeks. At the end of the intervention, the treatment group showed significantly greater gains than the control group on researcher-created and transfer measures of language and a transfer measure of reading comprehension. There were no statistically significant effects of the intervention on two measures of decoding.

Teachers followed an explicit core reading program. Overall, classroom instruction was rated as effective. Results indicate that controlling for students' end-of-kindergarten reading, their growth across kindergarten on a variety of language and literacy measures suppressed predictions of first-grade performance.

This study investigated the development of German-speaking children's orthographic knowledge with a nonword choice task. One nonword in each pair contained a frequent consonant doublet (zommul) and the other nonword contained an infrequent doublet (zobbul). Children (N = 54) performed at chance level in kindergarten but chose nonwords with frequent doublets significantly more often than expected by chance in first and second grade. Correlations between children's orthographic knowledge and their reading and spelling skills were not found. The results indicate that knowledge of frequent double consonants is evident in German-speaking children from first grade onwards, but it is not related to their reading and spelling performance. This finding is consistent with the view that children in transparent orthographies rely less on frequent letter patterns during reading and spelling compared to children in deep orthographies."

Subjects performed two RAN tasks (letters and objects), and data were analyzed through a response time analysis. Our results demonstrated that impaired RAN performance in dyslexic readers mainly stem from enhanced inter-item pause times and not from difficulties at the level of post-access motor production (expressed as articulation rates). Moreover, inter-item pause times account for a significant proportion of variance in reading ability in addition to the effect of phonological awareness in the dyslexic group. This suggests that non-phonological factors may lie at the root of the association between RAN inter-item pauses and reading ability. In normal readers, RAN performance was associated with reading ability only at early ages (i.e. in the reading-matched controls), and again it was the RAN inter-item pause times that explain the association.

Learning to speak is one of life’s most important accomplishments. Language, usually acquired so effortlessly, underpins every child’s learning and ability to interact with others and to establish relationships. Poor communication has profound implications for employment, health, literacy, parenting the next generation, and social inequalities. It is therefore of great societal concern that language, speech, and fluency disorders are among the most common developmental disorders.

The aim of this clinical review is to summarise the current information on language and speech impairments to help general practitioners, universal well child services, and paediatricians to identify the most common problems, understand their clinical course, decide when to refer and for what services, and understand what improvements can be expected.

Only in English receptive vocabulary did the EL1s outperform the ELs. In study 2, a subset of the students in study 1 was followed into grades 2 and 3 (36 EL1s and 33 ELs). Overall, the EL1s and ELs demonstrated similar performance and gains in English phonological awareness, word reading, and reading comprehension in grades 2 and 3. The EL1s outperformed their EL peers in English expressive and receptive vocabulary across all grades, despite more rapid growth among the ELs.

En el primer estudio, 81 EL1s y 147 ELs fueron examinados en el otono y la primavera de su primer grado. Los EL1 y los ELs mostraron resultados similares y mejoramientos comparables en cuanto a su conciencia fonologica y la lectura de palabras en ingles. Se observaron resultados comparables para todas las medidas en Frances (conciencia fonologica, vocabulario receptivo, lectura de palabra y comprension lectora). Los EL1 sobrepasaron a los ELs unicamente en cuanto al vocabulario receptivo en ingles. En el segundo estudio se le dio seguimiento a un subgrupo de estudiantes del primer estudio en el segundo y tercer grado (36 EL1 y 33 ELs). En su totalidad, los EL1 y los ELs mostraron resultados y mejoramientos similares en su conciencia fonologica del ingles, la lectura de palabras y la comprension lectora en el segundo y el tercer grado. Los EL1 sobrepasaron a sus companeros EL en cuanto al vocabulario expresivo y receptivo en todos los grados, a pesar de un crecimiento mas rapido en los ELs. Al mismo tiempo, los resultados de todas las medidas en frances eran comparables al de ambos grupos. Encontrar que los resutados son sorprendentemente comparables entre los EL1 y los ELs sugiere que, en total, la inmersion en frances no impide el desarrollo del lenguaje y la alfabetizacion del ingles en ELs, de forma que es una opcion viable para estos estudiantes.

Three screening measures, administered in September and May of kindergarten to 196 students, assessed number sense and computational fluency. Conceptual and procedural outcomes were measured at end of first grade, with MD operationalized as below the 16th percentile. The authors compared single-versus multiple-skill screeners, fall versus spring kindergarten screening, and conceptual versus procedural outcomes. Reliability and validity coefficients were adequate. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics analyses indicated that the single- and multiple-skill screeners produced good and similar classification accuracy at the fall and spring screening occasions in forecasting conceptual outcome. To forecast procedural outcome, the screeners produced similar but less accurate fits."

This 1-year longitudinal study, spanning the initial year of reading instruction, aimed at specifying the development of phonological discrimination, awareness and various aspects of phonological memory and at assessing their respective contributions to early reading acquisition. Our results show an increase in performance at each phonological processing step, but also suggest a qualitative evolution in their relative importance. Hierarchical regression analyses indicate that reading skills are mainly predicted by phonological awareness measured at the kindergarten stage and, subsequently, by phonological memory abilities measured at the end of first grade. More precisely short-term memory for serial-order information seems to contribute to the development of decoding abilities, while phonological knowledge stored in long-term memory seems to influence word recognition."

In de huidige studie werd onderzocht of reeds op een leeftijd van 41 maanden verschillen bestaan in de spraakproductie tussen kinderen met een genetisch risico op dyslexie en kinderen zonder een genetisch risico op dyslexie. Gevonden verschillen zouden als indicatoren kunnen worden gebruikt voor de vroegtijdige signalering van dyslexie. In totaal negen risico en tien controle kinderen werden onderzocht met een Benoemtaak en Nazegtaak (woorden en non-woorden). De verbale reacties van de kinderen werden fonetisch getranscribeerd. Vervolgens werden de geproduceerde fonemen en syllabestructuren geteld (onafhankelijke analyse) en vergeleken met de doeluitingen (relationele analyse). Samenvattend waren in beide groepen dezelfde ontwikkelingstendensen zichtbaar. Er werden geen significante verschillen gevonden in de fonologische en spraakmotorische vaardigheden tussen de risico en controle kinderen. Bij de Nazegtaak was wel een tendens te zien, dat controle kinderen meer profijt ondervonden van de lexicale status van een woord dan risico kinderen. Mogelijke verklaringen hiervoor zijn minder efficiente woordrepresentaties in het mentale lexicon en/of problemen bij het samenstellen van spraakmotorische programma’s vanuit nieuwe fonologische codes bij kinderen met een genetisch risico op dyslexie."

When one is considered a normal reader, he or she does not encounter much difficulty in reading and understanding texts. There are, however, children who have problems with phoneme identification and thus do not read well and they also have difficulties in comprehending texts. These learners should be identified and be assisted so that they can proceed with their learning lives. This study was guided by the following objectives: to investigate phonological awareness of learners with reading disability; to establish the correlation among the various measures of phonological awareness and to determine the significance of rapid automatic naming in reading. A sample of pupils in class six from the selected schools in Nairobi County was used in the study. Phonological awareness skills of these learners were tested to find out the nature of their awareness and skills in the tasks that were given. This study adopted an eclectic theoretical approach. The following theories guided the study: the Phonological Awareness Theory which states that reading based on the alphabetic system requires that readers be aware that words are made up of individual sounds and the Rapid Naming Theory which states that a good reader is one who has the ability to recall quickly and verbalize the names of presented objects which could also be individual alphabetical letters. The data were obtained from tape - recorded texts from the respondents and analysed to establish their nature of phonological awareness. Descriptive statistics which includes measures of central tendency and measures of correlation were used to summarize and describe the data. Tape recorded data were transcribed, analysed and then discussed. The results indicate that the respondents displayed phonological awareness skills in some PA tasks and experienced difficulties in some of the PA tasks. The study also found that there was no significant difference between the genders in their performances in the phonological awareness tasks. Various deficits in phonological awareness were also observed. These were categorized as mis-articulations of substitution, phoneme deletion, phoneme insertion, reading of the entire word instead of identifying the sounds; spelling the words; atypical and segmentation. It was also noted that there were correlations among the various measures of phonological awareness and absence of correlation among others. This showed that pupils have to be taught in all the measures for them to have phonological awareness skills. The study also looked at the significance of naming speed (RAN) in reading. It was observed that there were no significant differences in the time taken across the age groups and across the genders in the carrying out of the phonological awareness tasks."

In this paper, we use a combination of family fixed effects and genetic marker instruments to estimate the causal effects of poor adolescent mental and physical health status on years of completed schooling. By exploiting the genetic variation in inheritance within families, this empirical strategy presents a unique opportunity to isolate the variation in genetic factors from other dynastic and family characteristics. We present evidence that inattentive symptoms in early childhood have large lasting effects in reducing completed schooling. We also find little consistent evidence that adolescent overweight status influences years of schooling completed."

Measures of language, reading, general knowledge and math were collected from 295 children in fall of kindergarten and spring of second grade.

Olson","Haseman and Elston (H-E) [1972] proposed a method to detect quantitative trait loci by linkage to a marker. The squared sib-pair trait difference is regressed on the proportion of marker alleles the pair is estimated to share identical by descent: a significantly negative regression coefficient suggests linkage. It has been shown that a maximum likelihood method that directly models the sib-pair covariance has more power. This increase in power can also be obtained using the H-E regression procedure by changing the dependent variable from the squared difference to the mean-corrected product of the sibs' trait values. Multiple sibs in a sibship can be accommodated by allowing for the correlations between pairs of products in a generalized least squares procedure. Multiple trait loci, including epistatic interactions, involve only multiple linear regression. Multivariate traits can use the method of Amos et al. [1990] to find the linear function of the traits that maximizes the evidence for linkage, which now leads more simply to a test of significance. Multiple markers can be the basis of a multipoint analysis. Results of simulation studies for a continuous trait are presented that investigate Type I error and power. A similar general scheme can be used to study affected sib pairs, testing whether their identity by descent sharing probabilities are greater than would be expected in the absence of linkage, and to study other types of relative pairs.

Additionally, we examined gender differences in the development of letter writing skills. 471 children aged 3 to 5 years old completed a letter writing task. Results from factor analyses indicated that letter writing represented a unidimensional skill. Similar to research findings that the development of letter-names and letter-sound knowledge varies in acquisition, our findings indicate that the ability to write some letters is acquired earlier than the ability to write other letters. Although there appears to be an approximate sequence for the easiest and most difficult letters, there appears to be a less clear sequence for letters in the middle stages of development. Overall, girls had higher letter writing scores compared to boys. Gender differences regarding difficulty writing specific letters was less conclusive; however, results indicated that when controlling for ability level, girls had a higher probability of writing a letter correctly than boys. Implications of these findings for the assessment and instruction of letter writing are discussed."

Since dyslexia has a multifactorial etiology, this question can be restated as: what are the factors that put children at high risk for developing dyslexia? It is argued that a useful theoretical framework to address this question is Pennington’s (2006) multiple deficit model (MDM). This model replaces models that attribute dyslexia to a single underlying cause. Subsequently, the generalist genes hypothesis for learning (dis)abilities (Plomin and Kovas, 2005) is described and integrated with the MDM. Next, findings are presented from a longitudinal study with children at family risk for dyslexia. Such studies can contribute to testing and specifying the MDM. In this study, risk factors at both the child and family level were investigated. This led to the proposed intergenerational MDM, in which both parents confer liability via intertwined genetic and environmental pathways. Future scientific directions are discussed to investigate parent-offspring resemblance and transmission patterns, which will shed new light on disorder etiology."

Torgesen","Three bodies of research that have developed in relative isolation center on each of three kinds of phonological processing: phonological awareness, awareness of the sound structure of language; phonological receding in lexical access, receding written symbols into a sound-based representational system to get from the written word to its lexical referent; and phonetic receding in working memory, recoding written symbols into a sound-based representational system to maintain them efficiently in working memory. In this review we integrate these bodies of research and address the interdependent issues of the nature of phonological abilities and their causal roles in the acquisition of reading skills. Phonological ability seems to be general across tasks that purport to measure the three kinds of phonological processing, and this generality apparently is independent of general cognitive ability. However, the generality of phonological ability is not complete, and there is an empirical basis for distinguishing phonological awareness and phonetic recoding in working memory. Our review supports a causal role for phonological awareness in learning to read, and suggests the possibility of similar causal roles for phonological recoding in lexical access and phonetic recoding in working memory. Most researchers have neglected the probable causal role of learning to read in the development of phonological skills. It is no longer enough to ask whether phonological skills play a causal role in the acquisition of reading skills. The question now is which aspects of phonological processing (e.g., awareness, recoding in lexical access, recoding in working memory) are causally related to which aspects of reading (e.g., word recognition, word analysis, sentence comprehension), at which point in their codevelopment, and what are the directions of these causal relations?"

However, the nature of this relationship remains controversial because verbal STM, like reading acquisition, depends on the complexity of underlying phonological processing skills. This longitudinal study addressed the relation between STM and reading decoding acquisition by distinguishing between STM for item information and STM for order information based on recent studies showing that STM for item information, but not STM for order information, recruits underlying phonological representations. If there is a specific link between STM and reading decoding acquisition, STM for order information should be an independent predictor of reading decoding acquisition. Tasks maximizing STM for serial order or item information, measures of phonological abilities, and reading tests were administered to children followed from kindergarten through first grade. We observed that order STM capacity, but not item STM capacity, predicted independent variance in reading decoding abilities 1 year later. These results highlight the specific role of STM for order in reading decoding acquisition and argue for a causal role of order STM capacity in reading acquisition. Mechanisms relating STM for order information and reading acquisition are discussed."

The effects from phonemic blending fluency and letter sound fluency to decoding were completely mediated by phonogram fluency, decoding fluency, single-word reading fluency, and reading comprehension had direct effects on the text reading fluency of the second grade students. Understanding the relationship among the many component skills of readers early in their reading development is important because a deficiency in any of the component skills has the potential to affect the development of other skills and, ultimately, the development of the child as a proficient reader."

Gerry Taylor","Abstract Tests of phonology, semantics, and syntax were administered to 52 preschool children (19 girls and 33 boys, age 4–6 years) with moderate to severe speech sound disorders. The children's performance on these tests was used to predict language, reading, and spelling abilities at school age (age 8–11 years). Language impairment at school age was related to poor performance on preschool tests of syntax and nonsense word repetition, while reading impairment was predicted by poor performance in all preschool test domains (phonology, semantics, and syntax). In contrast, spelling impairment was predicted by deficits in preschool tests of phonological processing as measured by the Word Discrimination subtest of the Test of Language Development - Primary 2. Family history for speech and language disorders did not predict language, reading, or spelling impairment at school age. However, family history for reading disorders was a good predictor of school-age spelling difficulties."

Performance was studied in relation to duration of stimulus elements, interval between elements and number of elements in a sequence. No significant differences between groups were observed on visual tests. On auditory tests aphasics, but not controls, were adversely affected by decreases in duration of stimulus elements and interval between elements, and by increases in number of elements. Total duration of stimulus patterns proved critical to aphasics' performance. It is suggested that developmental aphasics are incapable of perceiving auditory information at a normal rate, and the possibility is considered that this constraint on the speed of auditory processing may underlie their language impairment."

Relations between book-related themes (e.g., types of talk), maternal evaluative feedback (e.g., praise, criticism), maternal miscue feedback (e.g., graphophonemic clues, terminal feedback), and child engagement (e.g., laughter, questions) were analyzed. The results suggest that the development of literacy appreciation and literacy skill can occur during the same storybook-reading session.

This suggests an explanation for the fact that preschool children are sensitive to rhyme, but often find tasks in which they have to isolate single phonemes extremely difficult. Words which rhyme share a common rime and thus can be categorized on that speech unit. Single phonemes on the other hand may only be part of one of these speech units. This analysis leads to some clear predictions. Young children, even children not yet able to read, should manage to categorize words on the basis of a single phoneme when the phoneme coincides with the word's onset (“cat,” “cup”) but not when it is only part of the rime (“cat,” “pit”). They should find it easier to work out that two monosyllabic words have a common vowel which is not shared by another word when all three words end with the same consonant (“lip,” “hop,” “tip”) but the odd word has a different rime than when the three words all start with the same consonant (“cap,” “can,” “cot”) and thus all share the same onset. The hypothesis also suggests that children should be aware of single phonemes when these coincide with the onset before they learn to read. We tested these predictions in two studies of children aged 5, 6, and 7 years. The results clearly support these predictions."

AIM: to determine the possible gain in performance in tasks involving phonemic awareness skills in boys and girls, following the development of a program to stimulate phonemic awareness. METHOD: participants were 18 boys and 18 girls, all with typical language development, in their second grade of Elementary Education. The study involved three steps. The first and third steps consisted of an auditory screening, speech and language assessments and the assessment of phonemic awareness skills, through the Phonological Awareness Tasks Protocol. The second step involved the planning of the phonological awaress stimulation program and its application in the classroom. RESULTS: boys and girls presented an improvement in their performance in all of the phonological awareness tasks after the application of the stimulation program; this improvement was statistically significant. Regarding the influence of gender, it was observed that prior to the application of the stimulation program, there was a significant difference between boys and girls in the task involving the detection of a phoneme in the last position. After stimulation, this difference remained significant in the same task, and was also statistically significant for the tasks of phonemic segmentation of words with six phonemes and phoneme reversion of words with two or three phonemes. CONCLUSION: it is observed that girls performed better in the majority of the phonemic awareness tasks, and that the program was effective in stimulating these tasks."

Lugo-Neris, Carla Wood Jackson, Howard Goldstein","Purpose: This study examined whether English-only vocabulary instruction or English vocabulary instruction enhanced with Spanish bridging produced greater word learning in young Spanish-speaking children learning English during a storybook reading intervention while considering individual language characteristics. Method: Twenty-two Spanish-speaking children learning English (ages 4-6) who participated in a summer education program for migrant families were randomly assigned to receive 2 weeks of each instruction: (a) word expansions in English or (b) English readings with word expansions in Spanish. Researcher-created measures of target vocabulary were administered, as were English and Spanish standardized measures of language proficiency and vocabulary. Results: Results revealed significant improvement in naming, receptive knowledge, and expressive definitions for those children who received Spanish bridging. Spanish expansions produced the greatest gains in the children's use of expressive definitions. Initial language proficiency in both languages was found to affect participants' gains from intervention, as those with limited skills in both languages showed significantly less vocabulary growth than those with strong skills in Spanish. Conclusions: Additional benefits to using Spanish expansions in vocabulary instruction were observed. Future research should explore additional ways of enhancing the vocabulary growth of children with limited skills in both languages in order to support and strengthen the child's first language and promote second language acquisition."

Low income makes a minor contribution. Socio-economic status exerts its influence on early literacy primarily through its association with other factors. Children from disadvantaged families are less likely to have experiences that encourage the development of fundamental skills for reading acquisition, specifically phonological awareness, vocabulary and oral language. These skills underlie the cognitive processes in the “simple view” of reading – word identification and language comprehension. Low quality early home literacy environments suppress children’s genetic potential, increasing the risk a child will struggle to learn to read. In addition, children from low socio-economic status backgrounds are more likely to have infant health outcomes associated with cognitive impairments, such as preterm birth and low birth weight, and are less likely to attend preschool.

Results of modified parallel analysis and analyses within the context of item response theory (IRT) showed phonological awareness to be unidimensional across different tasks and grades. Despite the evidence for a single underlying ability, the cognitive task requirements for the various tasks were found to differ. In addition to some overlap between the item sets, those for rhyming, phoneme identification, and phoneme blending were easier than those for phoneme segmentation and phoneme deletion. The results lend support to the assumption that phonological awareness is a continuum of availability for phonological representations which can range from partial availability (i.e., access) to full availability (i.e., access)."

Such information could be crucial for policy purposes because the relation between health and academic achievement may be different for students at the bottom and top of the test score distribution. We find that several health conditions are highly negatively correlated with math and reading test scores, both on average and at different points of the achievement distribution. Given the current education policy environment where schools are shifting resources to conform to state and federal requirements on test scores and other outcomes, the results suggest caution in cutting resources from the traditional role of schools in monitoring a wide set of health outcomes."

Parents of 183 children starting kindergarten in the fall (median child age = 58 months) completed an early home learning experiences questionnaire. Most of the children whose parents completed the questionnaire were recruited for numeracy and literacy testing 1 year later (along with 32 children from the inner city). Confirmatory factor analyses were used to reduce survey items, and hierarchical regression analyses were used to predict the relation among parents’ attitudes, academic expectations for their children, reports of formal and informal numeracy, and literacy home practices on children’s test scores. Parental reports of formal home numeracy practices (e.g., practicing simple sums) predicted children’s symbolic number system knowledge, whereas reports of informal exposure to games with numerical content (measured indirectly through parents’ knowledge of children’s games) predicted children’s non-symbolic arithmetic, as did numeracy attitudes (e.g., parents’ enjoyment of numeracy). The home literacy results replicated past findings; parental reports of formal literacy practices (e.g., helping their children to read words) predicted children’s word reading, whereas reports of informal experiences (i.e., frequency of shared reading measured indirectly through parents’ storybook knowledge) predicted children’s vocabulary. These findings support a multifaceted model of children’s early numeracy environment, with different types of early home experiences (formal and informal) predicting different numeracy outcomes."

Pérez-Castelló, Eduard Rigo-Carratalà, Daniel Adrover-Roig","Abstract Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) have severe language difficulties without showing hearing impairments, cognitive deficits, neurological damage or socio-emotional deprivation. However, previous studies have shown that children with SLI show some cognitive and literacy problems. Our study analyses the relationship between preschool cognitive and linguistic abilities and the later development of reading abilities in Spanish–Catalan bilingual children with SLI. The sample consisted of 17 bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI and 17 age-matched controls. We tested eight distinct processes related to phonological, attention, and language processing at the age of 6 years and reading at 8 years of age. Results show that bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI show significantly lower scores, as compared to typically developing peers, in phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming (RAN), together with a lower outcome in tasks measuring sentence repetition and verbal fluency. Regarding attentional processes, bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI obtained lower scores in auditory attention, but not in visual attention. At the age of 8 years Spanish–Catalan children with SLI had lower scores than their age-matched controls in total reading score, letter identification (decoding), and in semantic task (comprehension). Regression analyses identified both phonological awareness and verbal fluency at the age of 6 years to be the best predictors of subsequent reading performance at the age of 8 years. Our data suggest that language acquisition problems and difficulties in reading acquisition in bilingual children with SLI might be related to the close interdependence between a limitation in cognitive processing and a deficit at the linguistic level. Learning Outcomes : After reading this article, readers will be able to: identify their understanding of the relation between language difficulties and reading outcomes; explain how processing abilities influence reading performance in bilingual Spanish-Catalan children with SLI; and recognize the relation between language and reading via a developmental model in which the phonological system is considered central for the development of decoding abilities and comprehension."

Snowling,"The first case of developmental dyslexia was reported by Pringle-Morgan in the BMJ on 7 November 1896.1 Pringle-Morgan, a general practitioner, and Hinshelwood, an ophthalmologist also writing at the turn of the century,2 speculated that such difficulties with reading and writing were due to “congenital word blindness,” and for many years the dominant view was that dyslexia was caused by visual processing deficiencies. There is still continuing interest in the role of visual factors in the aetiology of dyslexia, especially in low level impairments of the visual system.3 4 However, most research suggests that these are not its cause. The most widely accepted view today is that dyslexia is a verbal deficit5 and can be considered part of the continuum of language disorders. Indeed, converging evidence supports a specific theory, that dyslexic readers have phonological (speech) processing deficits.

Tsevat, Sarah Eikenberry, Barbara A. Lewis, Lawrence D. Shriberg, Jean A. Tkach, Scott K. Holland","Abstract Children with persistent speech disorders (PSD) often present with overt or subtle motor deficits; the possibility that speech disorders and motor deficits could arise from a shared neurological base is currently unknown. Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to examine the brain networks supporting fine motor praxis in children with PSD and without clinically identified fine motor deficits. Methods This case-control study included 12 children with PSD (mean age 7.42 years, four female) and 12 controls (mean age 7.44 years, four female). Children completed behavioral evaluations using standardized motor assessments and parent reported functional measures. During fMRI scanning, participants completed a cued finger tapping task contrasted passive listening. A general linear model approach identified brain regions associated with finger tapping in each group and regions that differed between groups. The relationship between regional fMRI activation and fine motor skill was assessed using a regression analysis. Results Children with PSD had significantly poorer results for rapid speech production and fine motor praxis skills, but did not differ on classroom functional skills. Functional MRI results showed that children with PSD had significantly more activation in the cerebellum during finger tapping. Positive correlations between performance on a fine motor praxis test and activation multiple cortical regions were noted for children with PSD but not for controls. Conclusions Over-activation in the cerebellum during a motor task may reflect a subtle abnormality in the non-speech motor neural circuitry in children with PSD."
294,1972909829,theoretical links among naming speed precise timing mechanisms and orthographic skill in dyslexia,1993,10.1007/BF01026919,Reading and Writing,"Patricia Greig Bowers, Maryanne Wolf","In this paper, we review several lines of convergent research to discuss the relationship between developmental dyslexia and slow symbol naming speed. We describe the interactive development of orthographic and phonological codes, and we discuss the methodological problems that may have led to underestimating the importance of individual differences in orthographic processing in our account of reading disabilities. Symbol naming speed is typically subsumed under phonological processing, yet it contributes variance to reading, especially to reading fluency, independently of phonological awareness. We speculate that naming speed may reflect precise timing mechanisms necessary to the development of orthographic codes and to their integration with phonological codes. We argue that an understanding of this precise timing dimension is necessary to incorporate in our models of phonological, orthographic, and semantic processes in reading acquisition and reading failure."

Bishop,"Previous studies have found an association between motor immaturity and specific language impairment in children. Data from two twin studies were used to address the question of whether these linked deficits have a common etiology. Study 1 involved 57 MZ and 22 DZ pairs where one or both twins had specific speech/language impairment. A control group of 173 single-born children was also tested. Motor skill was assessed using a tapping task, which was carried out with left and right hands. Tapping scores were converted to scaled scores adjusted for age and sex. Unaffected twins and single-born controls did not differ in motor skill, but twins with speech and/or language impairments obtained significantly poorer tapping scores than controls. Bivariate DeFries-Fulker analysis pointed to shared genetic influence on tapping speed and a measure of speech production accuracy. In study 2, 37 twin pairs from study 1 were retested 2–3 years later and combined with 100 twin pairs from a general population sample. A timed peg-moving task was used to assess motor skill. Children with combined speech and language impairments obtained poorer peg-moving scores than unaffected children. Bivariate DeFries-Fulker analysis found significant shared genetic variance for impairments on peg-moving and on a test of nonword repetition. It is concluded that genes that put the child at risk for communicative problems also affect motor development, with the association being most evident when speech production is affected. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Of 123 preschoolers examined on letter knowledge, 65 underwent training on both letter names and letter sounds in a counterbalanced order. Prior to training, children were more advanced in associating letters with their names than with their sounds and could provide the sound of a letter only if they could name it. However, children learned more easily to associate letters with sounds than with names. Training just on names improved performance on sounds, but the sounds produced were extended (CV) rather than phonemic. Learning sounds facilitated later learning of the same letters’ names, but not vice versa. Training either on names or on sounds improved word recognition and explanation of printed words. Results are discussed with reference to cognitive and societal factors affecting letter knowledge acquisition, features of the Hebrew alphabet and orthography, and educational implications."

One view holds that sensitivity to various linguistic units reflects independent abilities, whereas another holds sensitivity to these units reflects one ability. We examined relations among sensitivity to words, syllables, rhymes, and phonemes in 149 older preschool children (4- and 5-year-olds) and 109 younger preschool children (2- and 3-year-olds) who completed eight measures of phonological sensitivity and measures of print knowledge. Confirmatory factor analyses of all combinations of word, syllable, rhyme, and phoneme factors found that a one-factor model best explained the data from both groups of children (CFIs > .98). Only variance common to all phonological sensitivity skills was related to print knowledge and rudimentary decoding. Findings support a developmental conceptualization of phonological sensitivity."

Pennington","The present study investigated the etiological relationship between two disorders: dyslexia or reading disability (RD) and phonological disorder (PD). These disorders manifest at different ages and have typically been studied by researchers in different disciplines. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the disorders overlap at symptomatic, cognitive, and etiological levels of analysis. In previous studies, each disorder has been found to be heritable, and there is also evidence that RD and PD run together in families, but no studies to date have documented whether there is a shared genetic influence between the two disorders. The present study examined this question in a sample of RD and non-RD twins. Subjects with a history of PD were identified and the etiological relation between the two disorders was examined. Results indicated that in the present sample, RD and PD are each heritable on their own. Further, even when correcting for RD, the two disorders were found to be coheritable, indicating that the finding of cofamiliality of RD and PD is at least partially driven by genetic influences. The implications of these results for the conceptualization, identification, and treatment of these two disorders are discussed."

This study investigated whether a non‐word repetition deficit underlies both disorders. A group of Dutch preschool SLI children and children at familial risk of dyslexia, as well as school‐going groups of SLI and dyslexic children were presented with a non‐word repetition task. The results showed that the SLI and the (at‐risk of) dyslexia groups performed more poorly than the control children. Furthermore, with the exception of one child, all preschool SLI children scored significantly below the mean of the preschool control group, suggesting that non‐word repetition performance is a marker of SLI. Approximately half of the at‐risk group were poor performers, which was expected on the basis of the familial risk factor of the at‐risk group. The results show that a non‐word repetition deficit is attested early in life and underlies both dyslexia and SLI."

This paper reviews these recent studies and emphasizes their main findings regarding the influence of letter-name knowledge in early and formal literacy for three main components of literacy acquisition: first, the emergence of the phonological processing of print; then, the learning of letter-sound correspondences; finally, the development of phonemic sensitivity skills.

Method: Ninety-five 4- and 5-year-old children with SSD were assessed during the spring of their prekindergarten year. Linear structural equation modeling was used to compare the fit of 2 models of the possible relationships among PA, speech perception, articulation, receptive vocabulary, and emergent literacy skills. Results: Half the children had significant difficulty with speech perception and PA despite demonstrating receptive language skills within or above the average range. The model that showed the best fit to the data indicated that speech perception is a pivotal variable that has a direct effect on PA and an indirect effect that is mediated by vocabulary skills. Articulation accuracy did not have a direct impact on PA. Emergent literacy skills were predicted by PA abilities. Conclusions: Children with SSD are at greatest risk of delayed PA skills if they have poor speech perception abilities and/or relatively poor receptive vocabulary skills. Children with SSD should receive assessments of their speech perception, receptive vocabulary, PA, and emergent literacy skills."

Understanding children's relationships within context is important for supporting children's development. Using child-friendly methodologies, the purpose of this research was to understand the lives of children with speech sound disorder (SSD) in context. Thirty-four interviews were undertaken with six school-aged children identified with SSD, and their siblings, friends, parents, grandparents, and teachers. Interview transcripts, questionnaires, and children's drawings were analyzed to reveal that these children experienced the world in context dependent ways (private vs. public worlds). Family and close friends typically provided a safe, supportive environment where children could be themselves and participate in typical childhoods. In contrast, when out of these familiar contexts, the children often were frustrated, embarrassed, and withdrawn, their relationships changed, and they were unable to get their message across in public contexts. Speech-language pathology assessment and intervention could be enhanced by interweaving the valuable insights of children, siblings, friends, parents, teachers, and other adults within children's worlds to more effectively support these children in context. Learning outcomes: 1. Recognize that children with SSD experience the world in different ways, depending on whether they are in private or public contexts. 2. Describe the changes in the roles of family and friends when children with SSD are in public contexts. 3. Discover the position of the child as central in Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model. 4.

We hypothesized that early semantic-syntactic deficits would be only weakly related, if at all, to the characteristically modular word recognition processes involved in reading isolated words and pseudowords. On the other hand, early language deficiencies were expected to be significantly associated with processes operating beyond the level of individual words when children are required to read and understand connected text.

Catts, Mindy Sittner Bridges, Todd D. Little, J. Bruce Tomblin","It is well recognized that oral language development lays the foundation for reading achievement (Catts, Fey, Zhang, & Tomblin, 1999; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2005; Storch & Whitehurst, 2002). Children with typical language (TL) development generally demonstrate normal reading achievement, whereas those with spoken language impairments (LI) often experience significant problems learning to read. Over the last 20 years, numerous studies have documented the poor reading outcomes of children with LI (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Botting, Simkin, & Conti-Ramsden, 2006; Catts, 1993; Catts, Fey, Tomblin, & Zhang, 2002; Menyuk et al., 1991; Naucler & Magnusson, 1998; Roth, Cooper, & Speece, 2002; Silva, McGee, & Williams, 1987; Tallal, Curtis, & Kaplan, 1989). Most of these studies have focused on early reading outcomes and have revealed the difficulties that these children have acquiring basic literacy skills. Few investigations, however, have system-atically followed children with LI into middle and high school (but see Snowling, Bishop, & Stothard, 2000). As a result, very little information is available concerning the growth of reading achievement across the school grades in this population.

The reading achievement growth trajectories of children with LI could take several forms when compared with those of children with TL development. Children with LI could show lower initial reading achievement but parallel growth over the school years. This has been referred to as a deficit model ofreading growth (Francis, Shaywitz, Stuebing, Shaywitz, & Fletcher, 1996). Alternatively, children with LI could demonstrate lower initial reading achievement but accelerated growth, which would allow them to catch up to their TL peers during the later school years. This pattern is known as a developmental lag or delayed pattern of reading growth (Francis et al., 1996). Finally, children with LI could get off to a slow start in reading achievement as well as demonstrate slower growth. This would lead to a widening ofthe gap in reading achievement between them and their TL peers. The latter pattern is characteristic of what some have called the Matthew effect (Stanovich, 1986) and of what others have referred to as a cumulative trajectory model of achievement (Leppanen, Niemi, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2004).

Variability in reading growth has been studied within the general population for some time. In a seminal article, Juel (1988) identified good and poor readers in first grade and compared their reading outcomes in fourth grade. She found that good readers typically remained good readers and that poor readers seldom “caught up” in reading achievement. Such results are supportive of either a deficit or cumulative trajectory pattern. Others have reported specific evidence of a cumulative trajectory pattern in which poor readers have continued to fall further and further behind good readers (Bast & Reitsma, 1998; Hayes & Grether, 1983; McKinney & Feagans, 1984; Williamson, Appelbaum, & Epanchin, 1991). For example, Bast and Reitsma (1998) reported an increase in variability in children's word reading scores in kindergarten through second grade but not through third grade. This increase in variability is indicative of the spreading out of growth trajectories (i.e., fan effect) associated with the Matthew effect.

The most comprehensive examination of the variability in reading growth in the general population was conducted in the Connecticut Longitudinal Study (Francis et al., 1996; Shaywitz et al., 1995). In an initial study, Shaywitz et al. (1995) followed approximately 400 children from first through sixth grade and reported no evidence of a cumulative growth trajectory pattern among poor readers. In a follow-up study, Francis et al. (1996) used individual growth curve analysis to test a deficit versus a developmental lag model of reading growth. They examined reading achievement from first to ninth grades in normal readers and two groups ofpoor readers from the sample. Results showed that all three groups displayed a quadratic growth pattern characterized by sharp initial growth through sixth grade and a plateau thereafter. Consistent with a deficit model, poor readers differed significantly from normal readers in initial level ofreading achievement but did not differ significantly in the rate of development (i.e., shape of growth curve). Others have also reported no evidence of widening of the achievement gap between good and poor readers (Baker, Decker, & DeFries, 1984; Scarborough & Parker, 2003).

Although information about the long-term reading achievement of children with LI is limited, there are a few relevant studies. Beitchman, Nair, Clegg, and Patel (1986) identified a large group of children with LI (N = 142) from an epidemiologic sample of 5-year-old children. Follow-up testing of their academic outcomes was conducted at 12 and 19 years of age (Johnson et al., 1999; Young et al., 2002). The researchers reported that children with LI performed significantly less well in reading achievement than normal controls at each age. However, no direct comparisons of growth in reading were made. In another longitudinal study, Bishop, Snowling, and colleagues identified a convenience sample of children with LI at 4 years of age (N = 87) and conducted follow-up testing when the children were 5, 8, and 15 years of age (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Snowling et al., 2000). Reading achievement was assessed at the latter two time points with different measures. However, the researchers made comparisons between ages on the basis of standard scores. Although not optimal, these data provide some suggestions concerning reading growth. Snowling et al. (2000) reported that children with LI, specifically those with specific LI, showed a decline in reading achievement relative to normal controls between 8 and 15 years of age. This apparent cumulative growth pattern was particularly the case for word recognition in children whose performance IQ was less than 100.

Whereas the above studies provide some initial information about reading achievement growth in children with LI, they were not optimally designed to measure growth across the school years. In the present investigation, we used data from the Child Language Research Study (Tomblin, 1995) to directly examine the reading achievement growth trajectories from 2nd to 10th grade of children with LI. In this study, children with LI and children with TL were identified in kindergarten, and their reading achievement was assessed with multiple measures of word recognition and reading comprehension in 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 10th grades. Latent growth curve (LGC) analysis was used to compare the reading achievement growth trajectories of these groups of children."

Across the three ages, reader groups did not differ in language comprehension, but did differ in confrontation and rapid automatized naming (RAN), three syntactic measures, and verbal memory. Group strengths and weaknesses were, with few exceptions apparent in kindergarten and maintained throughout. The kindergarten tasks which most effectively predicted reading group membership at grade 4 were giving letter sounds, and rapid naming; these predicted 4th grade reading group at close to 100 percent accuracy. The study, together with a further comparison of average and high IQ good readers, provides an interesting contrast between the role of RAN and Confrontation naming in reading."

Catts, Matthew Gillispie, Laurence B. Leonard, Robert Kail, Carol A. Miller","This study investigated the role of speed of processing, rapid naming, and phonological awareness in reading achievement. Measures of response time in motor, visual, lexical, grammatical, and phonological tasks were administered to 279 children in third grade. Measures of rapid object naming, phonological awareness, and reading achievement were given in second and fourth grades. Reading group comparisons indicated that poor readers were proportionally slower than good readers across response time measures and on the rapid object naming task. These results suggest that some poor readers have a general deficit in speed of processing and that their problems in rapid object naming are in part a reflection of this deficit. Hierarchical regression analyses further showed that when considered along with IQ and phonological awareness, speed of processing explained unique variance in reading achievement. This finding suggests that a speed of processing deficit may be an “extraphonological” factor in some reading d..."

This study presents a new analytic model to improve the classification and prediction of children's reading development. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify the presence of 10 different heterogeneous developmental patterns. In all, 411 children in kindergarten through Grade 2 from 3 elementary schools in Texas were administered measures of phonological awareness, word recognition, and rapid naming skills 4 times a year. The mean ages were 5.8 years (SD = 0.35) for the kindergartners, 6.9 years (SD = 0.39) for Grade 1, and 8.0 years (SD = 0.43) for Grade 2; the percentage of boys was 50%. The results indicate that precursor reading skills such as phonological awareness and rapid naming are highly predictive of word reading (word recognition) and that developmental profiles formed in kindergarten are directly associated with development in Grades 1 and 2. Students identified as having reading-related difficulties in kindergarten exhibited slower development of word recognition skills in subsequent years of the study."

Multiple measures of IQ, verbal short-term memory, speech perception, and phonological awareness were administered to 136 3rd and 4th graders. Application of structural equation modeling revealed that IQ, speech perception, and verbal short-term memory each contributed unique variance to the phonological awareness construct. All 4 experimental linguistic manipulations influenced phonological awareness item difficulties as well. Results underscore the importance of speech perception for phonological awareness"

Prior to any reading instruction, they were administered measures of phonological awareness, letter knowledge, and rapid naming speed. In Grade 2, they were administered measures of nonword decoding, text-reading fluency, and spelling. The results showed that the model for nonword decoding in Greek was similar to that of Finnish (both have consistent grapheme-to-phoneme mappings) while the model for spelling in Greek was similar to that of English (both have some inconsistent phoneme-to-grapheme mappings). In addition, the models for nonword decoding and spelling in Finnish were similar, because Finnish is consistent in both directions. Letter knowledge dominated the prediction in each language. The predictable role of orthographic consistency on literacy acquisition is discussed."

However, there is controversy about whether disabled readers have a speed deficit that is restricted to the identification of printed words, or if instead, they have a more general speed deficit in retrieving names of even single digits. To investigate this issue, poor and average readers (N = 43) in grade 2 were assessed on several indices of speed of digit and letter naming, using both continuous-list and discrete-trial methodologies. MANCOVA indicated clear effects of reader group on discrete-trial latencies, as well as an interaction between reader group and the speed with which to-be-named items were presented. A series of hierarchical regression analyses explored the amount of shared variance between various measures of digit naming speed and five indices of reading skill. Latency for word identification shares considerable variance with latency for digit naming, and, in general, accounts for the shared variance of naming speed and several other measures of reading skill. Naming specd contributed variance in reading skill independently of measures of phonological awareness."

Roth, Gary A. Troia, Colleen K. Worthington, Kathy Ayala Dow","The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of the rhyming portion of the Promoting Awareness of Sounds in Speech (PASS) program, a comprehensive and explicit phonological awareness intervention curriculum that was designed specifically for preschool children with speech and language impairments. A single-subject research design was used to examine treatment effects among children with varying levels of communicative competence, to permit flexibility while piloting the intervention program, and to provide experimental control. The PASS rhyming module was implemented with eight children with speech and/or language impairments, following the establishment of a stable pretreatment baseline on a series of phonological awareness probes. After instruction, all of the children demonstrated substantial improvement in their rhyming ability, which generally appeared to be attributable to the intervention rather than environmental or maturational factors. These findings suggest that PASS rhyming training was an effective approach to phonological awareness instruction for the preschoolers with disabilities who comprised our sample. Thus, it appears that explicit instruction in phonological awareness skills is beneficial for children at a point earlier than is typically judged to be therapeutically appropriate."

Mann","Speech problems and reading disorders are linked, suggesting that speech problems may potentially be an early marker of later difficulty in associating graphemes with phonemes. Current norms suggest that complete mastery of the production of the consonant phonemes in English occurs in most children at around 6–7 years. Many children enter formal schooling (kindergarten) around 5 years of age with near-adult levels of speech production. Given that previous research has shown that speech production abilities and phonological awareness skills are linked in preschool children, we set out to examine whether this pattern also holds for children just beginning to learn to read, as suggested by the critical age hypothesis. In the present study, using a diverse sample, we explored whether expressive phonological skills in 92 5-year-old children at the beginning and end of kindergarten were associated with early reading skills. Speech errors were coded according to whether they were developmentally appropriate, position within the syllable, manner of production of the target sounds, and whether the error involved a substitution, omission, or addition of a speech sound. At the beginning of the school year, children with significant early reading deficits on a predictively normed test (DIBELS) made more speech errors than children who were at grade level. Most of these errors were typical of kindergarten children (e.g., substitutions involving fricatives), but reading-delayed children made more of these errors than children who entered kindergarten with grade level skills. The reading-delayed children also made more atypical errors, consistent with our previous findings about preschoolers. Children who made no speech errors at the beginning of kindergarten had superior early reading abilities, and improvements in speech errors over the course of the year were significantly correlated with year-end reading skills. The role of expressive vocabulary and working memory were also explored, and appear to account for some of these findings."

The relation between early number competence and mathematics achievement was strong and significant throughout the study period. A sequential process growth curve model showed that kindergarten number competence predicted rate of growth in mathematics achievement between 1st and 3rd grades as well as achievement level through 3rd grade. Further, rate of growth in early number competence predicted mathematics performance level in 3rd grade. Although low-income children performed more poorly than their middle-income counterparts in mathematics achievement and progressed at a slower rate, their performance and growth were mediated through relatively weak kindergarten number competence. Similarly, the better performance and faster growth of children who entered kindergarten at an older age were explained by kindergarten number competence. The findings show the importance of early number competence for setting children’s learning trajectories in elementary school mathematics."

The study examined (a) developmentally changing relations among word-reading fluency, listening comprehension, text-reading fluency, and reading comprehension; (b) the relation of reading comprehension to text-reading fluency; (c) unique emergent literacy predictors (i.e., phonological awareness, orthographic awareness, morphological awareness, letter name knowledge, vocabulary) of text-reading fluency versus word-reading fluency; and (d) unique language and cognitive predictors (e.g., vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, theory of mind) of text-reading fluency versus reading comprehension. These questions were addressed using longitudinal data (two timepoints; mean age = 5 years 2 months and 6 years 1 month, respectively) from young Korean-speaking children (N = 143). Results showed that listening comprehension was related to text-reading fluency at time 2 but not at time 1. At both times, text-reading fluency was related to reading comprehension, and reading comprehension was related to text-reading fluency over and above word-reading fluency and listening comprehension. Orthographic awareness was related to text-reading fluency over and above other emergent literacy skills and word-reading fluency. Vocabulary and grammatical knowledge were independently related to text-reading fluency and reading comprehension, whereas theory of mind was related to reading comprehension but not text-reading fluency. These results reveal the developmental nature of relations and mechanisms of text-reading fluency in reading development."

Dutch children differing in family risk for dyslexia were followed from kindergarten through fifth grade. In fifth grade, at-risk dyslexic (n 522), at-risk non-dyslexic (n 545), and control children (n 512) were distinguished. In kindergarten, the at- risk non-dyslexics performed better than the at-risk dyslexics, but worse than the controls on letter-knowledge and rapid naming. The groups did not differ on phonological awareness. At-risk dyslexics read less fluently from first grade onwards than the other groups. At- risk non-dyslexics' reading fluency was at an intermediate position between the other groups at the start of reading. By fifth grade they had reached a similar level as the controls on word reading, but still lagged behind on pseudoword reading. Results further showed that the parents of the groups of at-risk children differed in educational level and reading skills. Overall, the groups of at-risk children differed on pre-reading skills as well as on reading development. These differences do not seem to stem from differences in intellectual abilities or literacy environment. Instead, the better reading skills of parents of at-risk non-dyslexics suggest that these children might have a lower genetic liability. Copyright r 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The current treatment paradigm for neonatal brachial plexus palsy focuses on upper extremity motor recovery with little formal assessment of other aspects of development, such as language. We performed a cross-sectional pilot study to investigate early language delay prevalence in toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy and potential neonatal brachial plexus palsy–related factors involved. Method Twenty toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy were consecutively recruited (12 males and eight females; mean age, 30 months). Preschool Language Scale Score (4th edition), demographics, and socioeconomic status were collected. Neonatal brachial plexus palsy–related factors such as palsy side, treatment type, Narakas grade, muscle Medical Research Council score, and Raimondi hand score were reported. Student t test, chi-square test, or Fisher exact test were applied. Statistical significance level was established at P Results Of study participants, 30% had language delay, whereas the prevalence of language delay in the population with normal development in this age range was approximately 5-15%. Interpretation We observed high language delay prevalence among toddlers with neonatal brachial plexus palsy. Although our subject sample is small, our findings warrant further study of this phenomenon. Early identification and timely intervention based on type of language impairment may be critical for improving communication outcome in this population."

Brown","Children at risk for reading disability were evaluated as kindergartners and again as first graders to determine (1) intercorrelations among phonological processing tasks and (2) the relationship of such tasks to word identification and word attack. With IQ controlled, there were no intercorrelations among measures of phonological awareness, phonetic recoding in working memory, and phonological recoding in lexical access. Thus, these results failed to substantiate the concept of a general phonological processing ability. Partial correlations controlling for IQ revealed no relationship between reading and phonological awareness or phonetic recoding in working memory. In contrast, lexical access measures were significantly, albeit moderately, correlated with word identification but not word attack. Word attack and word identification were predicted by different combinations of variables. These results suggest that lexical access ability is an important factor in reading acquisition and that different combinations of phonological processes may be related to different aspects of reading."

The results revealed that the relation between oral reading fluency and reading comprehension varied as a function of students' oral reading fluency and that different score types had varying predictive validity for year-end reading comprehension. The mean of all three passages demonstrated a marginally better balance in screening efficiency from September to December of grade one (especially for low-performing students), whereas in grades two and three, the median score was the best predictor. Furthermore, across all grades, increasing reading rates were observed for the three administered passages within an assessment period. The observed patterns mimicked previous experimental studies (Francis et al., 2008; Jenkins, Graff, & Miglioretti, 2009), suggesting that practice effects are an important consideration in the administration of multiple passages assessing oral reading fluency."

Behaviors reported significantly more often for the Low Nonverbal subjects were low motivation, poor work habits, inability to work independently or to take age-related responsibility, disorganization, and poor relationships with peers. High Nonverbal subjects, who exhibited signs of a probable left-brain dysfunction, were usually perceived by their teachers as sociable, responsible, and determined to succeed, in spite of their having language disorders and dyslexia.

We analyzed the language development of 200 children longitudinally at 14, 24, 30, and 42 months and assessed their symbolic play at 14 months. Half of the children (N = 106) were from families with a history of dyslexia (the Dyslexia Risk [DR] group), and other children served as age-matched controls. Parental reports and structured tests were used to assess children's receptive and expressive language and symbolic play. No differences emerged between the two groups in receptive language, symbolic play, or on the Bayley MDI. The groups, however, diverged in expressive language measures. The maximum sentence length at 2 years and object naming and inflectional morphology skills at 3.5 years were higher for the control group than for the DR group. Reynell receptive score at 2.5 years provided the greatest unique contribution to the prediction of the children's receptive and expressive language. Children's risk status did not contribute to receptive language, but provided a significant contribution to their expressive language at 3.5 years, even after the variance associated with parental education and children's previous language skills was controlled. Late talkers in the DR group differed from the other members of the DR group in both receptive and expressive language at 3.5 years, although in the control group children with a late-talking history performed at age-level expectations. The findings suggest that children with a familial risk for dyslexia and with a history of late talking are at higher risk for delays in language acquisition than children without the familial risk for dyslexia."

Consistent with previous studies in the West, informal home literacy experiences were associated with Chinese children's vocabulary knowledge, and formal literacy experiences with reading skills. These findings fit previous research which distinguishes formal and informal literacy experiences in relation to children's performance on reading and language skills, and indicates reading to children is less effective for acquisition of print-specific skills."

In each group, children's performances in early literacy skills (phonological awareness, letter knowledge, and word decoding) were assessed, as well as their achievement in linguistic and cognitive measures associated to these skills. The results showed that, notwithstanding the fact that there were no differences in word decoding, children with ID lagged behind on all predictor measures relevant to early literacy skills compared to children with NLA. Moreover, whereas children with NLA showed a regular predictive pathway of early literacy skills, children with ID showed a deviant pattern, in which nonverbal intelligence and rhythmic skills proved to be of major importance. Also letter knowledge appeared to be involved in their early literacy processing. It can be tentatively concluded that in the ID group, children's level of nonverbal intellectual abilities in combination with rhythmic ability proves pivotal in the development of their early literacy skills."

Kaizer","The present 10-year longitudinal study examined how rapid automatized naming (RAN) components—articulation time and pause time—relate to reading fluency. Seventy-five Greek-speaking children were followed from Grade 1 to Grade 10 and were assessed five times (in Grades 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10) on RAN (digits and objects) and reading fluency (word reading efficiency, phonemic decoding efficiency, and text reading fluency). The results indicated first that a substantial amount of variance in reading fluency was accounted for by what articulation time and pause time shared. In addition, the unique contribution of pause time to reading fluency decreased across time and the unique contribution of articulation time increased across time. Viewed in conjunction with the developmental changes in the RAN components, our findings suggest that the RAN tasks are processed and executed in different ways across time."

Sanders, Helen J. Neville","Recent behavioral studies suggest that children with poor language abilities have difficulty with attentional filtering, or noise exclusion. However, as behavioral performance represents the summed activity of multiple stages of processing, the temporal locus of the filtering deficit remains unclear. Here, we used an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to compare the earliest mechanisms of selective auditory attention in 12 children with specific language impairment (SLI) and 12 matched control children. Participants were cued to attend selectively to one of two simultaneously presented narrative stories. The stories differed in location (left/right speaker), narration voice (male/female), and content. ERPs were recorded to linguistic and nonlinguistic probe stimuli embedded in the attended and unattended story. By 100 ms, typically developing children showed an amplification of the sensorineural response to attended as compared to unattended stimuli. In contrast, children with SLI showed no evidence of sensorineural modulation with attention, despite behavioral performance indicating that they were performing the task as directed. These data are the first to show that SLI children have marked and specific deficits in the neural mechanisms of attention and, further, localize the timing of the attentional deficit to the earliest stages of sensory processing. Deficits in the effects of selective attention on early sensorineural processing may give rise to the diverse set of sensory and linguistic impairments in SLI children."

The high rate of reading problems among people with complex communication needs is explained within the context of factors that place people at risk of experiencing difficulties in learning to read. There is evidence to suggest that appropriate and direct reading instruction can result in improved reading skills even in the face of these risk factors. The development of an assessment protocol and an intervention to teach word reading using an analytic approach is described. These programs, which are available on the Web, were developed for use by people with complex communication needs in an attempt to redress the paucity of suitable and readily accessible materials for use with adults."

The aim of this study is to examine phonemic awareness and RAN as predictors of reading speed, reading comprehension and spelling for children with reading difficulties. It also investigates a possible reciprocal relationship between RAN and reading skills, and the possibility of enhancing RAN by intervention. These issues are addressed by examining longitudinal data from a randomised reading intervention study carried out in Sweden for 9-year-old children with reading difficulties (N = 112). The intervention comprised three main elements: training of phonics, reading comprehension strategies and reading speed. The analysis of the data was carried out using structural equation modelling. The results demonstrated that after controlling for autoregressive effects and non-verbal IQ, RAN predicts reading speed whereas phonemic awareness predicts reading comprehension and spelling. RAN was significantly enhanced by training and a reciprocal relationship between reading speed and RAN was found. These findings contribute to support the view that both phonemic awareness and RAN independently influence early phases of reading, and that both are possible to enhance by training."

Denenberg mounted two main lines of criticism, one concerning characteristics of the population sampled for the experimental group, and the other a statistical critique, concerning (a) violation of parametric assumptions for use of the F distribution and (b) our supposed acceptance of the null hypothesis of no differences between experimental and control groups. We show that the first criticism stemmed from a misunderstanding of the experimental hypothesis and that the second can be answered by both parametric and nonparametric comparisons across conditions within the experimental group, without reference to the control group. Thus, our original conclusion stands: The difficulty with rapid /ba/-/da/ discrimination that some children with reading impairment may experience does not stem from difficulty in discriminating the rapid spectral transitions at stop-vowel syllable onsets."
350,1980600287,the interrelationships of mathematical precursors in kindergarten,2011,10.1016/j.jecp.2010.11.004,Journal of Experimental Child Psychology,Paul T. Cirino,"Previous efforts have evaluated several potential predictors of mathematical performance in children at the kindergarten level (Geary, Hoard, & Hamson, 1999; Geary, Hamson, & Hoard, 2000; Gersten, Jordan, & Flojo, 2005; Jordan, Kaplan, Olah & Locuniak, 2006; Jordan, Kaplan, Locuniak & Ramineni, 2007; Koponen, Aunola, Ahonen, & Nurmi, 2007; Stock, Desoete, & Roeyers, 2007). Predictors that involve an understanding of quantity, that utilize counting, or that in some way tap “number sense” have recently received much attention, although subdivisions within this area are not always clear. In contrast to such number or quantitative predictors, there is also a large body of research that implicates non-quantitative cognitive skills, particularly domain general skills such as working memory, in the expression of math skill (e.g., Bull, Espy, & Wiebe, 2008; Geary, 2004; Swanson, 2006; Swanson, Jerman, & Zheng, 2008). Language and reading skills are also frequently implicated in discussions of math ability and disability in general (Jordan & Hanich, 2003; Jordan, Kaplan, & Hanich, 2002; Geary, 1993; Gersten et al., 2005), with several studies specifically assessing the role of phonological skills or other reading related skills such as rapid naming as predictors of mathematical outcomes (Geary, Hoard, Byrd-Craven, Nugent, & Numtee, 2007; Hecht, Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 2001; Krajewski & Schneider, 2009).

While many studies evaluate the relationships of the above types of precursors to math, there are a much smaller number that evaluate them in a multivariate context, and still fewer that do so in the context of a comprehensive model. Thus, little is known about how these sets of precursors relate to one another, which has implications for the extent to which they may have unique contributions to math performance. Recently, however, LeFevre and colleagues (LeFevre, Fast, Skwarchuck, Smith-Chant, Bisanz et al., in press) have proposed a model (the “pathways” model) relating the three types of precursors described above to mathematical achievement, and this serves as a framework for the present study. The current study contributes to existing research by: (a) evaluating the three pathways of LeFevre et al. (in press) at the level of latent rather than observed variables; (b) assessing the quantity domain comprehensively and distinguishing between core and mediating precursors therein; (c) establishing the relationship of these latent variables to a measure of small sums addition; and (d) examining performance in a relatively large and diverse sample at the kindergarten level, after students have been exposed to a formal learning environment, but have not yet completed development of their procedural arithmetic skills. Understanding what predicts early mathematical performance is crucial given the importance of these skills for more complex mathematical skill many years later (Duncan et al., 2007)."

Results indicated that, on average, social skills improved across the preschool year, while behavior problems remained relatively stable. Social skills and behavior problems were significantly related to multiple child school readiness outcomes in the areas of oral language, early literacy, and early math. In addition, the effects of different preschool literacy curricula on children's social and behavioral skills were examined. A greater percentage of children in the literacy intervention classrooms were categorized as lower risk (better social skills and fewer behavior problems) at the end of the preschool year, compared with children in classrooms without an added literacy curriculum. Implications for promoting cognitive and social development in preschool are discussed."

Siegel","The purpose of the study was to examine the nature of language, memory, and reading skills of bilingual students and to determine the relationship between reading problems in English and reading problems in Portuguese. The study assessed the reading, language, and memory skills of 37 bilingual Portuguese-Canadian children, aged 9–12 years. English was their main instructional language and Portuguese was the language spoken at home. All children attended a Heritage Language Program at school where they were taught to read and write Portuguese. The children were administered word and pseudoword reading, language, and working memory tasks in English and Portuguese. The majority of the children (67%) showed at least average proficiency in both languages. The children who had low reading scores in English also had significantly lower scores on the Portuguese tasks. There was a significant relationship between the acquisition of word and pseudoword reading, working memory, and syntactic awareness skills in the two languages. The Portuguese-Canadian children who were normally achieving readers did not differ from a comparison group of monolingual English speaking normally achieving readers except that the bilingual children had significantly lower scores on the English syntactic awareness task. The bilingual reading disabled children had similar scores to the monolingual reading disabled children on word reading and working memory but lower scores on the syntactic awareness task. However, the bilingual reading disabled children had significantlyhigher scores than the monolingual English speaking reading disabled children on the English pseudoword reading test and the English spelling task, perhaps reflecting a positive transfer from the more regular grapheme phoneme conversion rules of Portuguese. In this case, bilingualism does not appear to have negative consequences for the development of reading skills. In both English and Portuguese, reading difficulties appear to be strongly related to deficits in phonological processing."

Three hundred forty-seven Grade 4 children (82 Chinese-speaking Taiwanese children, 90 English-speaking Canadian children, 90 Greek-speaking Cypriot children, and 85 Finnish-speaking children) were assessed on RAN (colors and digits) and reading fluency (word reading efficiency and text reading speed). The results showed that articulation time accounted for more unique variance in reading in the alphabetic orthographies than in Chinese, and pause time for more unique variance in reading in Chinese than in alphabetic orthographies. If automaticity in RAN is manifested with a higher contribution of articulation time to reading fluency than pause time and with a strong relationship between articulation time and pause time, then our findings suggest that automaticity in RAN is reached earlier in alphabetic orthographies than i..."

During an academic year, 75 1st-grade children were assessed 7 times (once per month) in word reading, nonword reading, RAN numbers, and RAN colors. Results indicated a unique relationship between RAN numbers and early decoding skill. A bidirectional relationship between decoding skill and RAN numbers was supported, with RAN performance prior to the acquisition of decoding skill predictive of future decoding skill and with increased growth in RAN facilitated by the acquisition of decoding skill."

Study 1 compared three groups of English and Italian children on speed of processing tasks: (a) children with dyslexia, (b) generally delayed poor readers and (c) CA-controls. In tests of simple and choice reaction time and two visual scanning tasks, children with dyslexia performed like controls and significantly faster than generally delayed poor readers. A second prospective longitudinal investigation of children at family risk of dyslexia showed that problems of literacy development were less circumscribed, with affected children showing phonological deficits in the context of more general oral language difficulties. An important finding was that the risk of dyslexia was continuous in this sample; among at-risk children with normal literacy development, mild impairments of phonological skills were apparent early in development, and subtle difficulties with reading fluency and spelling emerged in early adolescence.

Results revealed that for poor readers, both speeded naming and phonological awarencess were significantly associated with word reading, but verbal intelligence had no association with it. In contrast, for good readers, phonological awareness and verbal intelligence were significantly associated with word reading, but naming speed was not. Findings are discussed in light of the double deficit hypothesis."

The primary research question was: Do kindergarten measures of early literacy skills in English predict first grade reading achievement for Spanish-speaking students as effectively as they do for English speakers? Participants were 3,448 economically disadvantaged students (50% spoke Spanish at home) from 243 schools. Regression analyses demonstrated that kindergarten variables accounted for similar percentages of variance in first grade reading for both Spanish speakers (43% in fall, 46% in spring) and non-Spanish speakers (49% in fall, 46% in spring) and that fall and spring variables were equally effective in predicting later achievement for both groups."

In the auditory modality, this deficit has been hypothesized to interfere with accurate speech perception, and subsequently disrupt the development of phonological and later reading and spelling skills. In the visual modality, an analogous problem might interfere with literacy development by affecting orthographic skills. In this prospective longitudinal study, we tested dynamic auditory and visual processing, speech-in-noise perception, phonological ability and orthographic ability in 62 five-year-old preschool children. Predictive relations towards first grade reading and spelling measures were explored and the validity of the global magnocellular model was evaluated using causal path analysis. In particular, we demonstrated that dynamic auditory processing was related to speech perception, which itself was related to phonological awareness. Similarly, dynamic visual processing was related to orthographic ability. Subsequently, phonological awareness, orthographic ability and verbal short-term memory were unique predictors of reading and spelling development."

Groups, separately and combined, showed a significant relationship between decoding, phonological awareness variables, word decoding, and successive processing that has also been observed among children from the mainstream culture. In general, the cognitive processing, reading, and reading subskills of First Nations children are, on average, below the norms for these measures.

The focus was on children’s understanding and production of narrative texts, seen as a common age-appropriate pre-academic text genre. Home language and literacy was measured with a short questionnaire, administered in personal interviews with the mothers. Other measures were the family’s socioeconomic status (SES), children’s receptive vocabulary and working memory. Children’s productive language in narrative text (re)telling already revealed many features of academic language. Furthermore, moderate to strong correlations were found between children’s emergent academic language and the language and literacy activities at home. Multiple regression analyses indicated that, in addition to working memory, home talking and reading predicted children’s vocabulary, and especially children’s text comprehension and text (re)telling. Finally, main and interaction-effects of working memory and home language and literacy on emergent academic language were examined. Although the results were not conclusive regarding the expected moderator effect of working memory, they revealed that children with both low working memory capacity and low academic language input were most disadvantaged."

The subjects were 124 French-speaking children, selected for their contrasting performance on reading and spelling tasks. The children in the first group ( N  = 69) were average readers; the second group of children ( N  = 55) performed worse or much worse on all reading and spelling tasks. The experimental design consisted of a set of 10 tasks administered in two sessions. The major findings reveal that: (1) the children with reading difficulties displayed low and slow performance on most cognitive tasks, whatever the modality; (2) auditory–verbal and visual–verbal processing speed significantly predicted written language, which was not the case with the visual modalities; and (3) that visual problems did not appear to be a potential cause of reading problems in most delayed readers. The findings also confirm the independence of phonological and naming-speed skills in reading development and reading impairment."

Two groups of first grade children participated: 39 children with a typical language development between the age of 73 and 88 months, and 59 children with SLI between the age of 71 and 97 months. The results indicated that children with SLI do have a quantitative delay in both grapheme knowledge and spelling during first grade. However, there was no qualitative difference between the early spelling of children with SLI and typically developing children. This indicated that children with SLI have the same spelling processes as typically developing children, although they develop slower. For clinical practice, this means that teachers of children with SLI can practice the same skills as with typically developing children, but they have to practice substantially more than typically developing children."

Although there is an extensive literature on cross-language effects on reading in general, research focusing on immersion students and including different dimensions of reading acquisition such as reading fluency and reading comprehension is scarce. This study therefore investigated cross-language transfer between first-language (L1) and second-language (L2) reading fluency and reading comprehension in a group of 220 German elementary school students who were enrolled in English partial immersion programs. Students were tested in grades 3 and 4. Structural equation modeling was used to examine cross-language transfer in a cross-lagged panel design. Results showed moderate cross-language paths when controlling for autoregressive effects. These findings are in line with previous results showing reciprocal transfer effects between L1 and L2 reading comprehension and reading fluency. In addition, the overall dominance of paths from L2 to L1 over paths from L1 to L2 suggests immersion-specific relations that may be attributable to the plentiful opportunities for academic reading in the L2 at school. Hence, skills necessary for successful reading can evidently be acquired in an L2 context and transferred to the L1. These findings underline the importance of cross-language transfer between reading skills in immersion programs."

These general conclusions held when either a liberal or a more stringent criterion for language impairment was employed. Some of these findings are consistent with those from earlier follow-up studies, which used less optimal methods. Thus, the present replication and extension of these findings with a sound methodology enables greater confidence in their use for prognostic, planning, and research purposes."

Hélène Deacon, Lesly Wade-Woolley, John R. Kirby","Achieving biliteracy is a remarkable accomplishment, and it is important to understand the range of factors that permit its successful realization. The authors investigated a factor known to affect reading in monolingual children that has received little attention in the second-language literature: morphological awareness. The researchers tracked the relationships between performance on past tense analogy tasks (the measure of morphological awareness) and reading of English and French in a group of 58 French immersion children across Grades 1–3. Early measures of English morphological awareness were significantly related to both English and French reading, after controlling for several variables. In contrast, early measures of French morphological awareness were significantly related to French reading only. Later measures of morphological awareness in French were significantly related to English and French reading. These relationships persisted even after controlling for several variables. Results of this study suggest that morphological awareness can be applied to reading across orthographies and that this relationship changes as children build their language and literacy skills. These findings are discussed in light of current theories of second-language reading acquisition."

Consistent with these data, children with poor reading comprehension exhibited oral vocabulary weaknesses and read fewer exception words correctly. These findings demonstrate that oral vocabulary is associated with some, but not all, reading skills. Results are discussed in terms of current models of reading development."

We present a Chinese individual (HLD) with brain damage whose profile challenges this hypothesis. HLD was severely impaired in the whole process of writing. He could not access orthographic knowledge, had poor orthographic awareness, and was poor at delayed- and direct-copying tasks. Nevertheless, he was perfect at visual word-picture matching and read aloud tasks, indicating his intact ability to access both the semantics and phonology in reading. He was also able to distinguish between fine visual features of characters. We conclude that reading does not depend on writing, even in Chinese."

This study examined the cognitive profile of Hebrew-speaking compensated adult dyslexics and investigated whether their cognitive abilities accounted for a unique variance in their reading performance. Sixty-nine young adults with and without dyslexia were administered a battery of tests measuring their reading skills and a number of cognitive abilities. The dyslexics were found to exhibit a generally poor cognitive profile, including their attention, visual working memory, naming, visual perception and speed of processing abilities, with the exception of high executive functions skills. Furthermore, naming speed, visual working memory and attention were significantly associated with decoding and fluency measures and predicted group difference after controlling for phonological skills. The findings point to the contribution of cognitive factors to decoding rate and possibly to the ability of utilizing rapid orthographic processes, thus effecting dyslexics’ reading performance."

Longitudinal and experimental training studies are examined in detail, as these are considered most appropriate for exploring a causal hypothesis of this nature. A particular focus of our analysis is the degree to which studies to date have controlled for existing literacy skills in their participants and the influence that these skills might have on performance on phonological awareness tasks. We conclude that no study has provided unequivocal evidence that there is a causal link from competence in phonological awareness to success in reading and spelling acquisition. However, we believe that such a study is possible and outline some ideas for its design and implementation."

METHOD: 75 boys and 88 girls, aged between 5:6 and 8:0, submitted to an assessment involving a form sent to the parents, a complete speech and language screening, the assessment of the intellectual and writing levels and the abilities in phonological awareness (PA). For a statistical data analysis we applied the Two-Way ANOVA, Tukey and T-Student tests. RESULTS: girls showed a positive significance in the tasks: syllabic segmentation with four syllable words (p=0.03); syllabic detection in the initial position (p=0.05), final position (p=0.01) and intermediary position (p=0.04). In the percentage analysis of the average in correct answers per task, boys' performance was only higher in tasks of sentence segmentation in words, with two (average=7.52), three (average=5.79), four (average=4.56), five (average=3.93) and six words (average=3.56) and in the nominal realism (average=8.93). CONCLUSION: we found a significant superior performance of the girls in the tasks of syllabic detection and syllabic segmentation with four-syllable words. In a qualitative analysis, girls obtained higher averages in all tasks of awareness and rhymes, syllables and phonemes."

Method: One thousand six hundred seventy-two children from the Twins Early Development Study (B. R. Oliver & R. Plomin, 2007) were given a comprehensive speech and language assessment at 4½ years. Reading was assessed at 7, 9, and 10 years. Twin analyses were applied to the data to assess the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the longitudinal relationships between speech and reading, and language and reading. Results: Phenotypically, there is a moderate and stable relationship between 4½-year speech and language scores and reading at 7, 9, and 10 years. Etiologically, at theindividual-differenceslevel,bothgeneticandsharedenvironmentalfactorscontribute to the links between language skills and reading. By contrast, genetic factors account for most of the relationship between early speech and later reading. At the extremes, there appears to be an even stronger role for genetic factors in accounting for the prediction from early speech and language impairments to later reading outcome. Conclusion: Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the relationship between early language skills and reading, whereas genetic factors play a dominant role in the relationship between early speech and reading."

Bird, Dorothy V. M. Bishop, Norman H Freeman","This study investigated the link between expressive phonological impairments, phonological awareness, and literacy. Previous investigations of literacy skills in children with speech impairments have given mixed results ; here we considered whether presence of additional language impairments or severity of the speech impairment was an important prognostic factor. Thirty-one children with expressive phonological impairments were compared with control children matched on age and nonverbal ability on three occasions, at mean ages of 70, 79, and 91 months. On each occasion they were given three tests of phonological awareness : one involved rime-matching and two involved onset-matching. At assessments 2 and 3 literacy skills were assessed. Children with phonological impairments scored well below their controls on phonological awareness and literacy, independent of whether or not they had other language problems. Although many of them knew letter sounds, they were poor at reading and writing nonwords as well as real words. It is suggested that both the speech impairment and the literacy problems arise from a failure to analyze syllables into smaller phonological units. The severity of the phonological problems in relation to age is an important determinant of literacy outcome ; children who have severe expressive phonological impairments at the time they start school are at particular risk for reading and spelling problems."

Emergent literacy skills were assessed in 72 children (M age = 5.05 years, SD = ± .03) who were followed longitudinally from preschool to the end of the first grade of primary school. Their early writing abilities (orthographic correctness in writing individual words) and their advanced writing abilities (orthographic correctness in text writing) were tested at the beginning and at the end of the school year. Multiple stepwise and logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the predictive capacities of emergent literacy abilities on early and advanced writing competences. Results show that notational competence is a strong predictor of early writing skills and that phonological competence only has an effect insofar as it is integrated with notational ..."

Forty Israeli Hebrew-speaking and 43 Spanish-speaking mother-child dyads participated in this study. The children, aged: M=68.58 months, had not yet been exposed to formal reading instruction. Israeli kindergartners embark on their initial steps in reading and spelling in an abjad—a consonantal writing system that deficiently and inconsistently marks vowels by letters. Spanish kindergartners are introduced to a shallow alphabetic writing system that consistently marks consonants and vowels. This study assessed: (1) children's code-based skills (letter knowledge and phonological awareness), spelling, and reading, and (2) mothers' word writing mediation. The groups were basically similar in code-based skills, but the reading and spelling of the Israeli children were substantially lower than those of their Spanish counterparts.

Smith, Helen Tager-Flusberg","Abstract Thirty-six 3- and 4-year-old children were given a battery of six metalinguistic tasks and two measures of language development: the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and a sentence comprehension test. The results clearly showed that the majority of preschoolers were able to make at least some metalinguistic judgments, and that metalinguistic performance improved with age. Furthermore, overall performance on the metalinguistic tasks was significantly correlated with each language measure when the effects of age were partialed out. In contrast, the correlation between age and metalinguistic performance was not significant once the effects of both language measures were partialed out. These data demonstrate that preschoolers' metalinguistic abilities are more extensive than has been previously acknowledged, and that they are closely tied to other aspects of language development at this time."

Gathercole, Alan Baddeley","Abstract The phonological memory skills of a group of children with disordered language development were compared with those of two control groups, one group matched on verbal abilities and the other matched on nonverbal intelligence. The language-disordered children were poorer at repeating single nonwords and recalling word lists than even the younger children of matched verbal abilities. The language-disordered children were, however, sensitive to both the phonological similarity and word length of the memory lists, except for the longest lists. The results of two further experiments indicate that the poor memory performance of the language-disordered children is unlikely to be due to either impaired perceptual processing or to slow articulation rates. Our proposal is that a deficit of phonological storage in working memory may underpin the poor memory performance of the language-disordered children, and could play a central role in their disordered language development."

Given the importance of word recognition in reading development, home contributions to word recognition as well as to four areas of emergent literacy that contribute to word recognition are highlighted. These include phonological awareness, letter knowledge, print concepts, and vocabulary. Particular attention is devoted to the activity of shared book reading to outline its different facets, changing nature, and potential impact on emergent literacy and word recognition skill. About a half a century ago—a phrase that conveys just how much our conception has changed— children were given ""reading readiness tests"" at school entrance to assess whether they were ""ready"" for the new initiative of learning to read. About 20 years ago, in concert with views of child development as a constructivist process, this conception began to change toward an understanding of learning to read as a process that starts much earlier in life and that is based upon a variety of foundational skills acquired before children enter formal schooling. The term emergent literacy, launched by Teale and Sulzby (1986) in their edited volume, and brought to life in Clay's (1993) observational studies of young children, was introduced to refer to this conception. More recently, it has come to refer to the skills and reading-like behaviours that are developmental precursors to their conventional and more ad- vanced counterparts. The view that the home environment in which children grow plays a substantial role in their literacy development is nicely illustrated by a large-scale study of twins completed by Petrill, Deater-Deckard, Schatschneider, and Davis (2005). Here, family environment characteristics were associated with children's read- ing outcome beyond what could be explained by genes shared by parents and children. The purpose of this review article is to detail key activities of the home environment provided by parents to young children that are predictive of reading development in general and, more specifically, of aspects of emergent literacy skills contributing to word recognition skill—phonological ability, alphabetic knowledge, concepts of print, and vocabulary. Given the salience of shared book reading as a home activity, a separate section is devoted to its different facets, changing nature, and potential effects. To provide a background for why these specific topics have been selected, a brief outline follows directly below of what is meant by emergent literacy and of the transition from emergent literacy to conventional word recognition."

Modest phenotypic correlations were found between environmental measures and the twins' print knowledge, general verbal ability, and phoneme awareness. Lower print knowledge in Scandinavian twins was related to country differences in preschool print environment. Latent-trait behavioral-genetic analyses indicated very strong shared-environment influences on individual differences in Print Knowledge. Genetic influence was also significant. Several other prereading skills varied in their environmental and genetic influence, including a significant contrast between Phonological Awareness and Print Knowledge. Rapid Naming also revealed very strong genetic influence, as did Verbal Memory. Stronger shared-environment influences were found for Vocabulary and Grammar/Morphology. Genetic and environmental correlations among latent traits for General Verbal Ability, Phonological Awareness, and Print Knowledge were high, but there were also significant independent genetic and environmental contributions to each skill. Practical implications include the need for substantial and sustained instructional support for children hampered by genetic constraints on early literacy development."

In total, 68 children were followed from Grade 2 to Grade 6 and were assessed three times on RAN (Digits and Objects), phonological awareness, orthographic processing, speed of processing, and reading fluency. Both RAN components were strongly related to reading fluency and, with few exceptions, accounted for unique variance over and above the contribution of speed of processing, phonological awareness, and orthographic processing. The amount of predictive variance shared between the components and the cognitive processing skills varied across time.

The nature of this relationship is unclear, despite the availability of a large number of studies, mostly on English speaking children. Phonological processing deficits have been considered the prominent cause of both difficulties. However recent findings in both children with SLI and in children with reading difficulties are not easily accommodated within a single dimensional model explaining the relationship between oral and written language deficits. Our study focuses on the long-term reading and spelling outcome in relation to preschool oral language skills in a group of Italian adolescents with a documented history of SLI. Sixteen Italian adolescents diagnosed as SLI at our Hospital in the pre-school years and 32 normal controls were submitted to an extensive assessment of oral and written language skills. At a group level SLI adolescents had weak oral and written language skills in almost all tests. Results show that reading difficulties have some features in common with those of Italian developmental dyslexics but also have distinct characteristics, since reading accuracy and written comprehension, usually relatively spared in Italian developmental dyslexics, were impaired in adolescents with SLI. Longitudinal analyses showed that expressive morpho-syntactic and lexical abilities at pre-school age were the oral language skills that best predicted reading and spelling outcomes in adolescents with SLI. However, also children with severe phonological impairment in the absence of other oral language deficits showed later literacy difficulties, although less severe and mainly limited to reading accuracy. Our study supports the notion that there is a complex relationship between oral and written language difficulties which may change at different developmental time points, not captured by a single deficit model, but best conceptualized considering multiple interactions between language skills and literacy abilities."

Abbott, Virginia W. Berninger","Abstract In the first study, 30 Spanish-speaking English-as-a-second language (ESL) first graders whose families were Latino immigrants and who received all their school instruction in English completed an assessment battery with both Spanish and English measures of phonological awareness, Verbal IQ (VIQ), oral language proficiency, and single-word reading (real words and pseudowords); they also named English alphabet letters. Phonological awareness in Spanish predicted (a) phonological awareness in English and (b) English word reading; thus, phonological awareness may transfer across first and second languages and across oral and written language. English VIQ and oral language proficiency predicted both English and Spanish word reading, but Spanish VIQ and oral language proficiency did not predict English word reading. In the second study, the 4 males and the 4 females with the lowest reading achievement participated in an instructional design experiment in which empirically supported instructional components for teaching beginning reading to monlingual English speakers were included. These components were phonological awareness training (in both Spanish and English), explicit instruction in alphabetic principle (in English), and repeated reading of engaging English text with comprehension monitoring (in English). Both individual students and the group as a whole increased in real-word reading and pseudoword reading beyond the level expected on the basis of their Spanish or English VIQ or oral proficiency. Implications of this research for school psychology practice are discussed, especially the importance of early reading intervention and progress monitoring for Spanish-speaking ESL first graders."

417,1989497768,dysfluent reading in the absence of spelling difficulties a specific disability in regular orthographies,2002,10.1037//0022-0663.94.2.272,Journal of Educational Psychology,"Heinz Wimmer, Heinz Mayringer","Two large studies identified substantial numbers of German-speaking children (Grade 3) with marked dissociations between reading and spelling difficulties. These dissociations were expected because German exhibits high regularity in the direction of graphemes to phonemes (forward regularity) but not in the direction of phonemes to graphemes (backward regularity). High forward regularity allows reliance on phonological processing in reading (even in advanced fluent reading), whereas low backward regularity requires reliance on orthographic memory representations in spelling. Dysfluent reading in the absence of spelling difficulties was associated only with a naming speed deficit—assessed at school entrance— but not with phonological memory or phonological awareness deficits. In contrast, a specific spelling deficit was preceded by phonological deficits. In orthographies with regular grapheme–phoneme relations, difficulties in learning to read take another form than they do in English. In English, the typical problem of children who are dyslexic is to read correctly unfamiliar words, whereas in more regular orthographies, the typical problem is to read fluently. To illustrate, in Landerl, Wimmer, and Frith’s (1997) comparative study, a majority of the 11-year-old English children who were dyslexic had a problem with the word character. Some children refused to read it and others produced misreadings ranging from chancelor and calendar to nonwords such as tshraekter. In contrast, the German children who were dyslexic for the close to identical word Charakter produced few misreadings (all nonwords), but their reading time was between 2 and 3 times higher than that of their peers who read normally. The massive reading fluency impairment of German children who were dyslexic in the context of relatively few errors (even under speed instruction) has been obtained in several studies (Klicpera & Schabmann, 1993;"

Share,"Abstract The self-teaching hypothesis proposes that phonological recoding functions as a self-teaching mechanism enabling the learner to independently acquire an autonomous orthographic lexicon. Successful decoding encounters with novel letter strings provide opportunities to learn word-specific print-to-meaning connections. Although it may not play a central role in skilled word recognition, phonological recoding, by virtue of its self-teaching function, is regarded as critical to successful reading acquisition. This paper elaborates the self-teaching hypothesis proposed by Jorm and Share (1983), and reviews relevant evidence. Key features of phonological recoding include an item-based rather than stage-based role in development, the progressive “lexicalization” of the process of recoding, and the importance of phonological awareness and contextual information in resolving decoding ambiguity. Although phonological skills have been shown to be primary in reading acquisition, orthographic processing appears to be an important but secondary source of individual differences. This implies an asymmetrical pattern of dissociations in both developmental and acquired reading disorders. Strong relationships between word recognition, basic phonological processing abilities and phonemic awareness are also consistent with the self-teaching notion. Finally, it is noted that current models of word recognition (both PDP and dual-route) fail to address the quintessential problem of reading acquisition - independent generation of target pronunciations for novel orthographic strings."

Georgiou, Rhonda Martinussen, Rauno Parrila","Current theoretical interpretations of naming speed and the research literature on its relation to reading are reviewed in this article. The authors examine naming speed's effects across languages and the shape of its relationship to reading. Also considered is the double-deficit hypothesis, by which students with both slow naming speed and low phonological awareness are hypothesized to be most at-risk for reading disability. Finally, the instructional literature regarding attempts to improve naming speed and use of naming speed as a predictor of response to intervention is reviewed. The authors conclude that naming speed is uniquely associated with a range of reading tasks across orthographies, and that early identification would be improved by the inclusion of naming speed measures. The poor response to instruction of students who have slow naming speed should be considered when designing interventions. Further work is required to specify the theoretical nature of naming speed and to determine how to help students with slow naming speed.

On analyse dans cet article les interpretations theoriques courantes de la vitesse de denomination et la litterature de recherche concernant ses relations avec la lecture. Les auteurs analysent les effets de la vitesse de lecture a travers les langues et la forme de sa relation a la lecture. On analyse egalement l'hypothese du double deficit selon laquelle les eleves ayant a la fois une vitesse de denomination lente et une conscience phonologique faible sont consideres comme presentant le plus de risques de difficultes en lecture. On analyse enfin la litterature pedagogique sur les essais d'amelioration de la vitesse de lecture et d'utilisation de la vitesse de denomination comme predicteur de la reponse a l'intervention. Les auteurs concluent que la vitesse de denomination est associee uniquement a un ensemble de tâches de lecture liees a l'orthographe, et que l'identification precoce pourrait etre amelioree si elle incluait des evaluations de la vitesse de lecture. Les reponses mediocres des eleves qui ont une vitesse de denomination lente devraient etre prises en consideration lors de la planification des interventions. D'autres travaux sont necessaires pour preciser la nature de la vitesse de denomination sur le plan theorique et pour determiner comment proceder pour aider les eleves qui ont une faible vitesse de denomination.

В статье рассматриваются современные теоретические взгляды на проблему, связанную со скоростью называния предметов, и исследования, посвященные связям подобной проблемы с навыками чтения. Авторы изучают разнообразные проявления этих связей на примере различных языков. Помимо прочего рассматривается гипотеза “двойного дефицита”, согласно которой ученики с низкой скоростью называния предметов и низкой способностью различения звуков считаются наиболее вероятными кандидатами в группу слабо читающих детей. И, наконец, рассматривается учебная литература, где описаны попытки повысить скорость называния предметов, поскольку она принята за индикатор потенциальной реакции на любое вмешательство. Выводы авторов состоят в том, что скорость называния предметов корректируется исключительно сочетанием заданий по чтению и орфографии и такие задания способствуют раннему выявлению проблем с чтением. При планировании учебного вмешательства следует учитывать, с какой скоростью ученики способны называть предметы. Требуются дальнейшие исследования, чтобы окончательно определить теоретическую подоснову этого навыка и характер помощи, в которой нуждаются ученики с низкой скоростью называния предметов.

En este articulo se examinan las interpretaciones teoricas mas recientes de la rapidez de nombrar y la literatura sobre la investigacion en cuanto a su relacion con la lectura. Los autores examinan el efecto de la rapidez de nombrar a traves de los idiomas y la forma en que se relaciona a la lectura. Tambien se examina la hipotesis de la doble deficiencia, la cual considera que los estudiantes lentos al nombrar y de poca conciencia fonologica estan a alto riesgo de tener dificultades con la lectura. Por ultimo, se revisa la literatura instruccional sobre los intentos de mejorar no solo la rapidez de nombrar sino tambien su uso como predictor de dificultades al leer. Los autores llegan a la conclusion que la rapidez de nombrar tiene una relacion especial con una serie de tareas de lectura a traves de las ortografias, y que se mejoraria la identificacion temprana si se incluyeran medidas de la rapidez de nombrar. La poca respuesta a la instruccion de estudiantes de baja rapidez de nombrar se debe tomar en cuenta al disenar intervenciones. Se necesitan mas estudios para especificar la base teorica de la rapidez de nombrar y para determinar como ayudar a los estudiantes con una baja rapidez de nombrar."

Fifty-seven kindergartners from 3 classrooms participated in a supplemental phonological awareness program, and 56 kindergartners from 3 classrooms received the prevailing school-adopted literacy curriculum. All children in the supplemental condition received supplemental classroom-based phonological awareness instruction in addition to the adopted literacy curriculum. At mid-year, 6 low literacy achievers were identified in each supplemental classroom (n = 18) to participate in an additional 12-week small-group intervention.

We administered a comprehensive battery of predictor tests that have been correlated with L1 decoding and comprehension skills in English to English-speaking students in early total French immersion at the beginning and end of kindergarten. Tests of word and pseudo-word decoding and reading comprehension in French were given at the end of grade 1. The best kindergarten predictors of L2 decoding were knowledge of the alphabetic principle in English, phonological awareness in English, and knowledge of French at kindergarten entry. The same variables were significant predictors of French reading comprehension, with the added contribution of scores related to oral language skills in L1. The results provide support for the SVR intra-linguistically, but not cross-linguistically."

Twelve individuals with Down syndrome, whose data were originally reported in Roch and Jarrold (2008), were seen four years later, and were given the same tasks as in the previous study evaluating phonological awareness, non-word reading and irregular word reading. After four years, an improvement was observed in all the skills of interest. Furthermore, the pattern of relationships among the three skills was observed to change considerably across the four year period. At the first time point, a weak association between non-word and irregular word reading was found, but there was a strong association between these two measures at the second time point. In contrast, a strong relationship was found at Time 1 between non-word reading and phonological awareness, which became weaker at Time 2. Longitudinal associations between the three skills were also examined in order to explain this changing pattern of associations. The results indicated that the ability to decode non-words plays a marginal role on later irregular word reading. In contrast, irregular word reading is a longitudinal predictor of later non-word reading. Phonological awareness was not longitudinally related to nonword reading. The results indicate that developing word knowledge can facilitate later non-word reading in Down syndrome, perhaps by a process of reading by visual analogy to"

Lai","The authors review the scientific evidence regarding the prediction of reading development from six cognitive constructs: phonological awareness, phonological decoding, naming speed, orthographic processing, morphological awareness, and vocabulary. The authors describe the theoretical connexions amongst these indicators and word reading. The authors conclude that there is substantial evidence of each contributing to reading, and in most cases, this contribution is above and beyond that of the other predictor constructs. These findings have implications for early and regular cognitive assessment, and for curriculum development and teacher education. Keywords: reading development, phonological awareness, naming speed, orthographic processing, morphological awareness Our goal in this paper is to review evidence concerning six major factors that have been shown to be related to reading development. We chose to focus on cognitive factors, not because motivation and self-perception are unimportant, but rather because the cognitive factors are more plausible causes of reading development. We also confined our discussion to specific cognitive factors that are involved in the process of reading, rather than on more general cognitive factors, such as intelligence, that are related to a broader range of behaviours, and whose specific causal role is more difficult to establish. Similarly, we omitted the various demographic characteristics that have been related to reading, such as gender and socioeconomic status (SES), partly because it is difficult to establish their causal status or exercise an influence on them, but also because, like the socioemotional factors, they operate on reading through the cognitive mechanisms that support reading. Finally, we focus on word reading, and not on reading comprehension. We do this partly because of the evidence that reading comprehension depends upon word reading (e.g., Adams, 1990), and partly because the cognitive factors on which we focus have a more proximal relationship to the more basic aspects of reading. We seek to understand the longitudinal predictors of reading for two reasons. First, because reading is a critical academic skill and because it takes so long to acquire, we would like to be able to predict reading difficulties before they occur and act to prevent them as best we can. Second, because the cognitive processes involved in learning to read are diverse and causally tangled, we explore the development of reading and its underlying processes so that we can untangle these causal relations. The first justification should lead to better educational practise, the second to better theory and practise. Reading instruction, broadly speaking, includes the intended curriculum, classroom teaching methods, assessment practises, remedial practises, and so on. These practises tend to develop in an ad hoc manner, with relatively little input from theory. Curriculum planners and classroom teachers are often not in a good position to judge theories and the evidence upon which they are based. Therefore, we see it as the responsibility of researchers in psychology and educational psychology to provide the empirical research foundation on which best practises in curriculum, teaching, assessment, and diagnosis are designed. A comprehensive theory based on solid evidence would provide a better basis for the development of principled practise and could make a substantial contribution to teacher education. The remainder of this paper consists of three sections. In the first, we briefly review several theories and sketch an overall theoretical framework that involves six causal factors. In the second, we examine each of the six factors in greater detail, and the evidence for their effects on reading. In this section, we pay particular attention to how the causal factors are related to each other, and whether they have unique effects in the presence of each other. …"

Georgiou","Abstract We examined in a series of studies the mechanism that may underlie the relationship between Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) and reading (accuracy and fluency) in Mandarin Chinese. Study 1 examined the “arbitrary” connections hypothesis in a sample of Grade 2 children ( N  = 182). Study 2 contrasted the phonological processing, orthographic processing, and speed of processing hypotheses in a sample of Grade 2 children followed until Grade 5 ( N  = 72). Finally, Study 3 contrasted the same hypotheses in a sample of Grade 4 children with dyslexia ( n  = 30) and chronological-age controls ( n  = 30). The results indicated that (a) RAN is unrelated to Paired Associate Learning (PAL) tasks that tap the ability to form arbitrary connections between characters and their pronunciation, (b) controlling for nonverbal IQ and orthographic processing was sufficient to explain the RAN–reading accuracy relationship but not the RAN–reading fluency relationship, and (c) the observed differences between dyslexics and controls in RAN diminished after controlling for orthographic processing. Taken together, these findings suggest that RAN is related to reading accuracy (and partly to reading fluency) because children must access orthographic representations from long-term memory. Although accessing these representations is sufficient for accurate word recognition, it is not sufficient for fluent reading, which also requires efficient parafoveal processing."

The first is error of approximation which involves the fit of the model, with optimally chosen but unknown parameter values, to the population covariance matrix. The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of â€œclose fitâ€ of a model is suggested."

Reed,"The processing of speech and nonspeech sounds by 23 reading disabled children and their age- and sex-matched controls was examined in a task requiring them to identify and report the order of pairs of stimuli. Reading disabled children were impaired in making judgments with very brief tones and with stop consonant syllables at short interstimulus intervals (ISI's). They had no unusual difficulty with vowel stimuli, vowel stimuli in a white noise background, or very brief visual figures. Poor performance on the tones and stop consonants appears to be due to specific difficulty in processing very brief auditory cues. The reading disabled children also showed deficits in the perception of naturally produced words, less sharply defined category boundaries, and a greater reliance on context in making phoneme identifications. The results suggest a perceptual deficit in some reading disabled children, which interferes with the processing of phonological information."

In Experiment 1, two groups of children were compared. The experimental group was taught the names of letters whose sounds occur either at the beginning (e.g., the letter /be/) or in the middle (e.g., the letter /‘eli/) of the letter name. The control group was taught the shapes of the letters but not their names. Then both groups were taught the sounds of the letters. Results showed an advantage for the experimental group, but only for beginning-sound letters. Experiment 2 investigated whether training in phonological awareness could boost the learning of letter sounds, particularly middle-sound letters. In addition to learning the names of beginning- and middle-sound letters, children in the experimental group were taught to categorize words according to rhyme and alliteration, whereas controls were taught to categorize the same words semantically. All children were then taught the sounds of the letters. Results showed that children who were given phonological awareness training found it easier to learn letter sounds than controls. This was true for both types of letters, but especially for middle-sound letters."

Bishop","A popular hypothesis holds that specific reading disability (SRD) and specific language impairment (SLI) result from an impaired ability to process rapid and brief sounds. However, the results of experiments that have tested this hypothesis are incongruous. A number of factors could explain these contradictory findings, including the questionable reliability and validity of rapid auditory processing tasks, individual differences in the auditory processing abilities of SRD and SLI populations, the age of listeners, the quality of control groups, and the relationship between verbal and non-verbal auditory processing abilities. These issues highlight the need for future studies to (1) establish the reliability and validity of psychophysical tasks used to assess rapid auditory processing; (2) report the rapid auditory processing scores of individuals rather than just group means; (3) include a wide range of reading and spoken language tests to determine the literacy and oral language profile of people who demonstrate an auditory processing deficit; (4) include clinical comparison groups to determine whether a rapid auditory processing deficit is related specifically to written and spoken language impairments; and (5) examine the relationship between low-level non-verbal, verbal, and phonological processing abilities.

Genetic approaches including the identification of genes linked to speech and language phenotypes and the characterization of normal and aberrant functions of these genes have, in recent years, unraveled complex details of molecular and cognitive mechanisms and provided valuable insight into the biological foundations of language. Consistent with this approach, we have reviewed the functional aspects of allelic variants of genes which are currently known to be either causally associated with disorders of speech and language or impact upon the spectrum of normal language ability. We have also reviewed candidate genes associated with heritable speech and language disorders. In addition, we have evaluated language phenotypes and associated genetic components in developmental syndromes that, together with a spectrum of altered language abilities, manifest various phenotypes and offer details of multifactorial determinants of language function. Data from this review have revealed a predominance of regulatory networks involved in the control of differentiation and functioning of neurons, neuronal tracks and connections among brain structures associated with both cognitive and language faculties. Our findings, furthermore, have highlighted several multifactorial determinants in overlapping speech and language phenotypes. Collectively this analysis has revealed an interconnected developmental network and a close association of the language faculty with cognitive functions, a finding that has the potential to provide insight into linguistic hypotheses defining in particular, the contribution of genetic elements to and the modular nature of the language faculty."

Merzenich, Steve Miller, William M. Jenkins","One of the fundamental goals of the modern field of neuroscience is to understand how neuronal activity gives rise to higher cortical function. However, to bridge the gap between neurobiology and behavior, we must understand higher cortical functions at the behavioral level at least as well as we have come to understand neurobiological processes at the cellular and molecular levels. This is certainly the case in the study of speech processing, where critical studies of behavioral dysfunction have provided key insights into the basic neurobiological mechanisms relevant to speech perception and production. Much of this progress derives from a detailed analysis of the sensory, perceptual, cognitive, and motor abilities of children who fail to acquire speech, language, and reading skills normally within the context of otherwise normal development. Current research now shows that a dysfunction in normal phonological processing, which is critical to the development of oral and written language, may derive, at least in part, from difficulties in perceiving and producing basic sensory-motor information in rapid succession – within tens of ms (see Tallal et al. 1993a for a review)."

Measures administered in kindergarten were evaluated for their ability to predict first-grade reading achievement. It was found that a child's ability to name letters in kindergarten was the strongest predictor of first-grade reading skill. Among the nonreading measures, measures of linguistic processing skills, particularly phonological processing, were found to account for the largest proportion of variance in first-grade reading. Several characteristics of the kindergarten language arts program were also found to be related to first-grade reading performance. Further, some of these relationships varied depending on the risk status of the children for experiencing later reading difficulties as determined on the basis of the prediction aspect of the study.

In this article, we examine specific genetic hypotheses about the mode of transmission of developmental dyslexia by performing complex segregation analyses. Design. —A family study method was applied, whereby the relatives of dyslexic probands were examined for dyslexia. The families studied represent four independently ascertained samples. Setting. —The four samples of families were primarily from rural and suburban communities of Colorado, Washington State, and Iowa. Participants. — A total of 204 families and 1698 individuals in the four samples combined. Main Outcome Measures. —The complex segregation program, POINTER, was used to test competing genetic hypotheses of how a categorical trait (dyslexia) is transmitted in families. Results. —The results were consistent with major locus transmission in three of four samples and with polygenic transmission in the fourth. In these three samples, the estimates of penetrance for the AA, Aa , and aa genotypes (where A is the abnormal allele) were, respectively, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.001 to 0.039 in males, and 0.560 to 1.000, 0.550 to 0.897, and 0.000 in females. The estimated gene frequency of the major locus was between 3% and 5%. Conclusions. —Sex-influenced, additive, or dominant transmission occurs in a significant proportion of dyslexic families. Other evidence indicates, however, that dyslexia is etiologically heterogeneous and that there is genetic heterogeneity even among families selected for apparent dominant transmission. Thus, while no single major locus may account for all of dyslexia, it is important to pursue potential major loci for dyslexia using linkage techniques. (JAMA. 1991;266:1527-1534)"

A combination of predictor variables was found to be more effective than single measures in predicting later word reading and reading fluency, with cognitive ability, phonemic awareness, and letter knowledge contributing significantly to the prediction of skill. The results underscore the need to use a multivariate battery, rather than any single measure, along with consideration of intelligence, to identify children for early intervention."

Children in French Immersion programs in Grade 3 were asked to name aloud cognates, interlingual homographs, interlingual homophones, and matched control words. Half of the participants performed the task in English, their first oral language, and half performed the task in French. Control monolingual children in each language were also tested. In the French reading task, fewer errors were observed for cognates and interlingual homophones than for matched control words, whereas more errors were produced for interlingual homographs than matched controls. Only the inhibitory interlingual homograph effect was observed in the English reading task. These data provide evidence that phonological activation in bilinguals is not language selective. The locus of each of these effects in the bilingual word recognition system is discussed."

Chinese dyslexic children performed significantly worse than the CA controls but similarly to the RL controls on most of the cognitive tasks. The rapid naming deficit was found to be the most dominant type of cognitive deficit in Chinese dyslexic children.

Children in the same classroom, however, often show vastly different alphabet learning needs. Moreover, recent research suggests that some letters are more difficult to learn. These facts run counter to one-size-fits-all whole-class instructional approaches, which typically provide the same instruction to all children and for all letters. The purpose of this article is to encourage early childhood educators to move beyond whole-class approaches and instead provide alphabet instruction that is aligned with current emphases on assessment-driven decision making and differentiated instruction. The article reviews the importance of alphabet knowledge with respect to theory, research, and the current educational context, summarizes recent research concerning children's alphabet knowledge development, and provides a framework in which assessment guides differentiated alphabet instruction, along with empirically-validated practices for such instruction."

Verbal short-term memory and phonological awareness skills were assessed to determine whether learning new words involved accurately representing phonological information in memory. Results showed a relationship between verbal short-term memory measures and typically developing individuals’ ability to learn the phonological form of novel words but not their ability to learn the physical referent of new words. Similarly, individuals with Down syndrome showed impaired verbal short-term memory and impaired form but not referent learning. Together, these findings specify the circumstances in which an accurate phonological representation within short-term memory is required for new word learning."

Bishop, Martha B. League","Abstract. The purpose of this followup study was to determine the long-term predictive validity of theoretically coherent reading measures administered during fall and winter of kindergarten. Seventy-nine children were screened using measures representing letter identification, phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming. Reading achievement was measured at the end of grades 1 through 4 on passage comprehension, oral reading fluency, sight-word recognition, and phonemic decoding. A multivariate screening model incorporating letter identification, phonological awareness, and rapid automatized naming emerged as the most parsimonious model for predicting long-term reading achievement. This screening model yielded the highest correlations with oral reading fluency as the outcome measure. There was no practical significance between the fall and winter screening over the four-year period using this model. Results are interpreted as confirming the importance of a multivariate screening approach using letter identification, phonological awareness, and rapid automatized naming at the earliest time frame in kindergarten. ********** A monumental effort is underway in this country to ensure all children are proficient readers before exiting elementary school. Under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001 every child must meet challenging literacy standards by the end of the 2013-2014 academic year or face unprecedented consequences. Over half of the states currently report that graduation from high school is contingent on performance on exit exams (Skinner & Staresina, 2004). Other states, such as Florida, have imposed retention requirements on third grade students not reading at grade level, regardless of any special needs or circumstances (Florida Department of Education, 2004). Schools are responding to this sweeping legislative mandate, implementing the use of evidence-based practices as required by the NCLB legislation. Fortunately, the reading research community has amassed a sound research base on the effective elements of early reading instruction (National Reading Panel, 2000; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998) and efforts are underway to provide training to teachers to deliver scientifically based reading instruction (U.S. Department of Education, 2002). Success reported from multiple studies of early intervention programs underscores the effort that is being made by schools and researchers to ensure that every child becomes a reader. Most children who receive intensive early intervention tailored to their specific deficits become functional readers (Foorman, Francis, Fletcher, Schatschneider, & Mehta, 1998; O'Connor, 2000; Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 1997). However, challenges remain. Intervention programs are costly, particularly for schools with a high concentration of students who enter school behind their peers. With limited resources, it is important that educators be able to accurately determine which children would be best served to receive early intervention instruction. For the past eight decades, the research community has attempted to identify appropriate screening measures, investigating multiple constructs that have ranged from mental maturity (Deputy, 1930) to phonological processing skills (e.g., Wagner et al., 1997) to a combination of such variables as phonological awareness, rapid naming, letter identification, language factors, and the mother's education (Catts, Fey, Zhang, & Tomblin, 2001). While reading researchers are rapidly developing screening measures to identify students with potential reading difficulties, consensus has not been reached on the optimal combination of predictive measures (Scarborough, 1998; Schatschneider, Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, & Foorman, 2004), and issues related to matching the most appropriate reading outcome measures with screening measures are still under investigation (Speece, Mills, Ritchey, & Hillman, 2003). …"

Findings on general reading outcomes, in English and French, are reviewed first, followed by a review of reading outcomes for students who are at risk for reading difficulty because of below-average levels of academic ability, poor first language abilities, disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, and minority language status. There follows a review of studies on individual differences in reading outcomes, including research on students with or at risk for reading difficulties, and on interventions to support students with reading difficulties in immersion. Conclusions along with suggestions for future research are offered. The Canadian educational landscape changed dramatically in 1965 with the introduction of a French immersion program in the small community of St. Lambert, Quebec. This program took a radical departure from traditional education in Canada by educat- ing English-speaking students in French. Students in this new program received initial literacy (and academic) instruction in French before being taught reading and writing in English. Im- mersion programs have proliferated across the country (and indeed worldwide) since 1965, and there are currently over 300,000 Canadian students in immersion (Canadian Parents for French, n.d.). The original St. Lambert program provided all instruction in French beginning in kindergarten until the end of Grade 2. Alter- native forms of immersion have been developed, varying primarily with respect to when French is used as a medium of curriculum instruction (in primary or middle elementary grades, or later—in late elementary or high school) and how much instruction is given through French; distinctions are usually made between total and partial immersion with the latter consisting of less than 100% instruction and a minimum of 50%. Detailed descriptions of pro- totypical immersion program models can be found in Genesee (1987, 2004). We review findings on reading acquisition in students in early French immersion programmes (see Genesee, 1987, 2004; Lam- bert & Tucker, 1972; and Swain & Lapkin, 1982, for general reviews). There was an initial surge in research on immersion programs that lasted until approximately the mid1980s. Research during this period was motivated largely by concerns about the effects of immersion on student achievement, including reading. This has been followed by research with a greater focus on individual differences in, and processes underlying, the acquisition of French reading skills in immersion. We begin with research that has examined general reading outcomes in English and French, followed by studies on students who might be considered at risk for low levels of achievement in reading because of below-average levels of academic ability, poor or impaired first-language abili- ties, disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, and minority lan- guage status. We then review studies on individual differences in reading outcomes, including research on students who are at risk for reading difficulty, and finally studies on interventions for students who need additional support."

Data from 2 samples representing diverse regions, ethnicity, and socioeconomic backgrounds ( n s = 1074 and 500) were analyzed using item response theory (IRT) and differential item functioning techniques. Results from factor analyses indicated that letter name knowledge represented a unidimensional skill; IRT results yielded significant differences between letters in both difficulty and discrimination. Results also indicated an approximate developmental sequence in letter name learning for the simplest and most challenging to learn letters—but with no clear sequence between these extremes. Findings also suggested that children were most likely to first learn their first initial. We discuss implications for assessment and instruction."

Parents of normally developing beginning readers were audiotaped in their homes reading books with their children in kindergarten, first grade, and second grade. Parent responses to miscues were coded as either ignoring the miscue, encouragement to try the word again, graphophonemic clues, context clues, or supplying the word. Clues parents gave prior to a child's attempting to read a word were also coded. For each feedback category there were statistically significant differences over time. As grade level increased, parents decreased their use of context clues, supplying the misread word, and clues given prior to a child's attempt at a word. In contrast, they increased their use of encouragement to try the word again and ignoring the miscue. Giving graphophonemic clues peaked in first grade. In addition, cluster analysis and correlations indicated stability in parent strategies across the grades. Findings suggest that parents have styles of supporting emerging reading skills that are adapted as children's skills increase.



Este estudio longitudinal llevado a cabo en los primeros grados investigo la posible existencia de patrones en las estrategias de apoyo que los padres ponen en juego cuando los ninos cometen errores durante la lectura compartida de libros. Asimismo se estudio si los padres modificaban el uso de esas estrategias en el tiempo, a medida que la capacidad de lectura de los ninos aumentaba. Se hicieron grabaciones de audio a un grupo de padres de lectores iniciales de desarrollo normal (jardin, primero y segundo grado); las mismas se llevaron a cabo en los hogares durante la lectura compartida de libros. Se codificaron las respuestas de los padres a los errores de lectura de la siguiente manera: ignorar el error, alentar a repetir la palabra, dar pistas grafofonemicas o contextuales y proporcionar la palabra correcta. Tambien se codificaron las pistas dadas por los padres antes del intento del nino por pronunciar una palabra. Se hallaron diferencias significativas a lo largo del tiempo para cada categoria de apoyo. Cuanto mas alto el grado de escolaridad, disminuian las estrategias de uso de pistas contextuales, proporcionar la palabra correcta y dar pistas antes del intento de leer del nino. Por el contrario, aumentaron el uso de la incentivacion para que el nino tratara de volver a leer y la estrategia de ignorar el error. La estrategia de dar pistas grafofonemicas alcanzo el pico en primer grado. Adicionalmente el analisis de los clusters y las correlaciones evidenciaron estabilidad en las estrategias de los padres a traves del tiempo. Los hallazgos sugieren que los estilos de los padres para dar apoyo a las habilidades de lectura inicial se adaptan a medida que aumenta la capacidad de los ninos.



Diese Quer durch die Primarstufen ausgefuhrte Langzeitstudie untersuchte, ob es Muster in den Feedbackstrategien gab, die Eltern aufgrund von Fehlhinweisen der Kinder beim gemeinsamen Buchlesen vermittelten, und ob Eltern die Anwendung solcher Strategien im Laufe der Zeit veranderten, sobald sich die Leseleistungen ihrer Kinder steigerten. Eltern von sich normal entwickelnden Leseanfangern wurden wahrend des Lesens von Buchern zu Hause, mit ihren Kindern im Kindergarten, in der ersten Klasse und in der zweiten Klasse mittels Tonband aufgenommen. Elternreaktionen auf Fehlhinweise wurden entweder als Ignorierung der Fehlhinweise, Ermunterung das Wort nochmals zu versuchen, graphophonemische Hinweise, Kontexthinweise, oder als das Uberliefern des Wortes kodiert. Hinweise, die Eltern einem Kind vor dessen Versuch das Wort zu lesen gaben, wurden ebenfalls kodiert. Fur jede Feedbackkategorie ergaben sich im Laufe der Zeit statistisch bedeutende Unterschiede. Mit der Steigerung der Unterrichtsstufe verringerten die Eltern ihre Anwendung von Kontexthinweisen, Lieferung des falsch gelesenen Wortes und die im voraus gegebenen Hinweise, bevor das Kind das Wort aufgriff. Im Gegenteil, steigerten sie die Anwendung von Ermunterungen zum erneuten Versuch des Wortes unter Nichtbeachtung des Fehlhinweises. Das Vermitteln von graphophonemischen Hinweisen erreichte die Spitze in der ersten Klasse. Zusatzlich zeigten Blockanalyse und Korrelationen Stabilitat in den Elternstrategien quer durch alle Stufen. Die Erkenntnisse lassen vermuten, das Eltern ihre Anwendungsmethoden zur Unterstutzung aufstrebender Lesefahigkeiten haben, die angepasst werden, sobald sich die Leistungen der Kinder steigern.



Cette etude longitudinale au long de la scolarite primaire cherche a savoir s'il y a des structures dans les strategies que les parents utilisent lorsque les enfants font des erreurs en situation de lecture partagee de livres, et si les parents changent de strategie dans le temps lorsque les competences lecturales des enfants se developpent. On a procede a des enregistrements audio de parents d'enfants apprenant a lire sans probleme alors qu'ils lisaient des livres a la maison avec leurs enfants, et ce au jardin d'enfants, en premiere et en seconde annee. On a code les reponses des parents aux erreurs en: absence de reaction, incitation a relire, indices grapho-phonemiques, indices semantiques, lecture du mot par l'adulte. On a egalement code les indices que les parents donnaient avant que les enfants essaient de lire un mot. Il apparait des differences significatives dans le temps pour chaque type de feedback. Au fur et a mesure que le niveau de l'enfant s'ameliore, les parents emploient de moins en moins d'indices graphophonemiques, de lecture du mot par l'adulte, et d'indices fournis avant que l'enfant essaie de lire un mot. Par contre, ce qui augmente est les incitations a relire le mot et le fait de ne pas reagir a l'erreur. Le fait de donner des indices grapho-phonemiques culmine en premiere annee. L'analyse par clusters et par correlations indique que les strategies des parents sont stables d'une classe a l'autre. Les resultats laissent penser que les types d'aides fournies par les parents aux enfants apprennant a lire s'adaptent aux progres que ceux-ci effectuent."

Gathercole","The present study explores the relationship between sentence recall and reading and language skills in a group of 7–11-year-old children with learning difficulties. While recent studies have found that performance on sentence recall tasks plays a role in learning, it is possible that this contribution is a reflection of shared resources with working memory. In order to investigate whether sentence recall was uniquely associated with reading and language skills, differences associated with IQ and working memory capacity were statistically controlled. A sample of 72 children was tested on measures of verbal complex memory, verbal short-term memory, sentence recall, expressive vocabulary, verbal and performance IQ, reading and language skills. Both sentence recall and verbal complex memory shared unique links with reading skill, and sentence recall was uniquely associated with language skills. This finding indicates that resources in long-term memory also play an important diagnostic role in reading and language abilities. The implications for educational practice are discussed."

Bowey,"Two groups of 5-year-old children whose fathers' occupations differed markedly in education and skill levels were seen in preschool, where they were given tests of performance IQ, receptive vocabulary and grammar, verbal working memory, phonological sensitivity, letter knowledge, and novice reading ability. At the end of first grade, academic achievement was assessed. Marked group differences were observed on most measures. Most differences remained after performance IQ effects were controlled. When general verbal ability effects were controlled, differences in phonological sensitivity and word-level reading and arithmetic achievement remained. When phonological sensitivity effects were also controlled, differences remained only in arithmetic performance. The same general pattern of results was observed in converging hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Overall, the results are consistent with the view that socioeconomic status differences in word-level reading achievement are mediated partly through preexisting differences in phonological sensitivity."

The eight multiplex families (N=171) presented in this study were ascertained from a sample of adult probands whose childhood reading history is well documented through archival information. Six phenotypes were constructed to span a range of dyslexia-related cognitive processes. These phenotypes were (1) phonemic awareness (of spoken words); (2) phonological decoding (of printed nonwords); (3) rapid automatized naming (of colored squares or object drawings); (4) single-word reading (orally, of printed real words); (5) vocabulary; and (6) spelling (of dictated words). In addition, the diagnosis of lifelong dyslexia was established by clinical means. Genotyping was done with nine highly polymorphic markers from the 6p22.3–6p21.3 region. The results of two- and multipoint identity-by-descent and identity-by-state analyses supported the importance of a putative locus in the D6S464–D6S273 region for a number of dyslexia-related cognitive deficits."

Thal, Judy Reilly, Laura Seibert, Rita Jeffries, Judith Fenson","Abstract At 3 years of age the spontaneous language of 17 typically developing children was compared to two groups of toddlers who were at risk for language delay for very different reasons. One at-risk group, late talkers, appeared normal in all respects except for their delayed language. These 20 children scored at or below the fifteenth percentile for expressive vocabulary on the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory ( Fenson et al., 1993 ) when originally identified at 20–27 months of age and within the normal range on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development ( Bayley, 1969 ). The other group, 21 children with unilateral focal brain injury, suffered localized damage to their brain prenatally, perinatally, or within the first 6 months of life. Results indicated that both of the at-risk groups were still significantly lower in vocabulary diversity and grammar at 3 years of age. There was also significantly greater variability in the at-risk groups than in the control groups, and in the children with focal brain injury than in the late talkers in both areas. The importance of language comprehension to development in this period was supported by two findings. First, children with focal brain injury had significantly lower scores than late talkers on the Index of Productive Syntax, a test of emerging grammar, and had been lower in comprehension on a standardized test of language comprehension a year earlier. Second, late talkers with delay in comprehension as well as production had significantly lower scores on IPSyn than those with normal comprehension, suggesting that they are at greater risk for continued delay. Qualitative analyses indicated that the at-risk groups produced the same kinds of errors, but that late talkers produced a substantially greater proportion of errors in obligatory contexts than did children with focal brain injury."

This study investigated the English and Chinese language performance of students enrolled in early English immersion in a Chinese primary school. In addition, factors that could predict successful English word recognition were investigated. There were 183 participants who were tested in both Chinese and English word identification, phonological awareness, and vocabulary, as well as English oral proficiency and letter name knowledge. The immersion students performed significantly better than the non-immersion group on measures of English vocabulary, word identification, and oral proficiency, without any detrimental effects on their Chinese character reading, which made the program, in effect, an additive bilingual system. In addition, phonological awareness and letter name knowledge proved to be strong predictors of English word identification for the immersion students, a finding that was similar to results obtained in studies of native English-speaking children. The findings have potentially useful pedagogical applications."

Leitao, John H. Hogben, Janet Fletcher","Phonological processing has been shown by many researchers to be strongly related to the acquisition of reading and spelling skills. Children with speech and language impairment appear to be at increased risk for phonological processing problems and hence literary difficulties. However, not all children with speech and language impairment experience difficulties: the literature is not clear as to which groups of speech and language impaired children are most severely affected nor which aspects of phonological processing are most likely to be impaired. Rigorous subject selection was employed to compare the performance of four groups of 20 children, aged approximately 6 years: speech-impaired (Speech); language-impaired (Language); speech and language impaired (Mixed); and children with normally developing language (Normal), by use of a battery of phonological processing tasks. The results supported the research that has shown speech and language impaired children to have weaker phonological processing skills than the general population. All the subjects in this sample appeared to be at risk: the Mixed children demonstrated the most difficulty, followed by the Language group, with the Normal group performing the best. Whilst the Speech group as a whole performed significantly more poorly than the Normal group, it consisted of two levels of performance which, on post hoc analysis were shown to relate to the pattern of speech impairment exhibited by the child."

One hundred two children were randomly assigned to the KITS intervention and 90 were randomly assigned to the foster care services as usual comparison group. At the end of the kindergarten year, teachers were asked to report on the children's oppositional and aggressive behaviors in the classroom. Controlling for gender, baseline levels of parent-reported oppositional and aggressive behaviors, and level of disruptiveness in the classroom, children who had received the intervention had significantly lower levels of oppositional and aggressive behaviors in the classroom.

Measures of orthographic learning and word reading were included in the analyses to determine how these patterned with the learning processes. An exploratory factor analysis of the genetic correlations among the variables indicated a three-factor model. Vocabulary tests loaded on the first factor, the Grade 2 measures of word reading and orthographic learning, plus preschool letter knowledge, loaded on the second, and the third was characterized by tests of verbal short-term memory. The three genetic factors correlated, with the second (print) factor showing the most specificity. We conclude that genetically influenced learning processes underlying print–speech integration, foreshadowed by preschool letter knowledge, have a degree of independence from genetic factors affecting spoken language.

Eighty-two Greek children from mainly middle socioeconomic backgrounds were followed from kindergarten to grade 1 and were assessed on measures of nonverbal intelligence, emergent literacy skills, early math concepts, verbal counting, reading, and math fluency. The parents of the children also responded to a questionnaire regarding the frequency of home literacy and numeracy activities. The results of path analyses indicated that parents’ teaching of literacy skills predicted reading fluency through the effects of letter knowledge and phonological awareness. Storybook exposure predicted reading fluency through the effects of vocabulary on phonological awareness. Finally, parents’ teaching of numeracy skills predicted math fluency through the effects of verbal counting. These findings suggest that both the home literacy and the home numeracy environments are important for early reading and math acquisition, but their effects are mediated by emergent literacy and numeracy skills."

The contribution from rapid naming to literacy development was low in Kindergarten, but similar to that of phonological awareness and print knowledge in Grade 1. The present study identified a significant difference across orthographies in the effects of print knowledge and general verbal ability on spelling in Kindergarten. However, this pattern was explained by cultural rather than orthographic differences.

The results of the study showed that children receiving interactive writing identified more lower case and upper case letters at the end of the study relative to children in the control, but no differences were observed on letter sounds. While continued evaluation of the interactive writing strategy is needed in the preschool setting, the evidence from the current study shows encouraging trends in alphabet knowledge skill development as a result of this strategy."

The present study aimed to (1) determine whether these children with a history of LD had deficits in basic reading skills, i.e. decoding and comprehension, compared to the age norms of standardized tests, (2) analyze if there was a relationship between reading outcome and neuropsychiatric diagnosis by comparing three subgroups of children, LD pure, LD + ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and LD + ADHD, and, (3) determine what language measures at age 6 years were associated with the 7–8-year reading outcome. Both decoding and comprehension of single word reading were significantly below the norm for the whole LD group, where children with LD + ASD scored lowest, and children with LD highest. However, the differences between the three groups did not reach significance. Two reader groups were identified according to the results of word decoding and comprehension, respectively, resulting in the same 7 children. ANOVA revealed that the only differences on the 6-year language tests between the two groups were found on color naming and word memory. This study has shown that children with LD and subsequently identified neurodevelopmental problems such as ASD and ADHD experience continued deficits, demonstrated also in reading skills and that the picture of the reading problems seemed to resemble those of typically developing children."

Petraki, V. Rotsika, I. Tsipra, L. Legaki, C. Richardson, H. Lazaratou","Research has shown that specific developmental language disorders (SDLD) may develop over time into other impairments or disorders. For instance, children with these diagnoses often show learning, social adjustment or behaviour disorders in adolescence. On the other hand, many professionals claim that early intervention has a significant effect on these disorders. The question which arises is whether early intervention can forestall the development of these more serious consequences in adolescence. The aim of this study is to examine adolescents who had been diagnosed with SDLD in childhood and who had attended during their preschool years an Early Intervention Programme (EIP) within a Community Mental Health Centre. These adolescents' outcomes are compared with those of adolescents who had also been diagnosed with SDLD, but who had not complied with therapy. The experimental group (N = 44), now have a mean age of 13 years, whereas the control group (N = 52), who had not accepted therapy, have a mean age of 14 years. The parameters which were investigated were school achievement, social and emotional adjustment, behaviour, language skills, and their parents' attitudes. Statistical analysis shows that although some of the treated adolescents now exhibit learning difficulties, those who began their therapy before the age of 5 are presently showing significantly better concentration and behaviour than all the other groups. In conclusion, early intervention seems to be effective for children with SDLD and may restrict the appearance of more serious social adjustment and behavioural problems in adolescence."

La prueba se aplico a una muestra representativa de 344 ninos espanoles con edades comprendidas entre los 3 y los 6 anos. Esto ha permitido trazar una secuencia evolutiva del desarrollo de esta habilidad que ayuda a esclarecer ciertas contradicciones detectadas en la investigacion previa. Ademas, establecer la secuenciacion evolutiva del conocimiento fonologico puede servir como guia a la hora de disenar programas de intervencion dirigidos a fortalecer y mejorar su adquisicion, con el beneficio que esto supondria para los futuros lectores. El trabajo se centra en lo que se conoce como preparacion a la lectura o inicio a la lectura (reading readiness) y pretende facilitar el acceso a la lectura a edades tempranas."
506,2004704302,environmental factors associated with early reading achievement in the developing world a cross national study,2013,10.1016/j.ijer.2012.10.006,International Journal of Educational Research,Elliott Friedlander,"Abstract Educational research from the developed world is often used as the basis for policies and programs in the developing world. However, local contextual factors should be taken into consideration in any transfer of research findings. This study examines associations that socioeconomic status (SES) and the home literacy environment (HLE) have with reading achievement in the developing world. Models that predict reading achievement are created and the patterns across countries are analyzed. The correlation coefficients for achievement and SES, as well as achievement and HLE are compared. Significant between-country variation in the best proxies for SES and HLE is discovered. Results from this study suggest that education efforts in the developing world must consider local contexts to achieve their goals."
507,2004784315,predicting dyslexia from kindergarten the importance of distinctness of phonological representations of lexical items,1998,10.1598/RRQ.33.1.3,Reading Research Quarterly,"Carsten Elbro, Ina Borstrøm, Dorthe Klint Petersen","This article presents results from a longitudinal study of children of dyslexic and of normally reading parents. The children were followed from the beginning of kindergarten (at the age of 6, 1 year before reading instruction in Denmark) until the beginning of the second grade. Children of dyslexic parents were found to have an increased risk of dyslexia (a 4.3 odds ratio) when dyslexia was defined as poor phonological recoding (poor reading of nonwords and pseudohomophones of real words). All language measures in kindergarten were statistically significant predictors of dyslexia. Logistic regression analyses with backwards stepwise selection indicated that three measures contributed independently to the prediction of dyslexia: letter naming, phoneme identification, and distinctness of phonological representations. The measure of distinctness of phonological representations also contributed significantly to the prediction of poor phoneme awareness in Grade 2—even when differences in early syllable and phoneme awareness, articulation, and productive and receptive vocabulary were accounted for. The results suggest that the quality of phonological representations in the mental lexicon is a determinant of the development of both segmental (e.g., phoneme) awareness and of the acquisition of phonological recoding skills in reading.

ESTE TRABAJO presenta los resultados de un estudio longitudinal de ninos hijos de padres dislexicos y normales. El seguimiento de los ninos se produjo desde el comienzo del preescolar (a la edad de seis anos, un ano antes de comenzar la ensenanza de la lectura en Dinamarca), hasta el comienzo de segundo grado. Se hallo que entre los hijos de padres dislexicos aumentaba el riesgo de dislexia (a razon del 4.3) cuando se definia la dislexia como problemas de recodificacion fonologica (problemas para leer pseudo-palabras y pseudo-homofonos de palabras reales). Todas las medidas de lenguaje tomadas en preescolar fueron predictoras de dislexia estadisticamente significativas. Los analisis de regresion logistica con seleccion por pasos indicaron que las tres medidas contribuian independientemente a la prediccion de la dislexia: nombrar letras, identificar fonemas y la precision de las representaciones fonologicas. La medida de precision de las representaciones fonologicas tambien contribuyo significativamente a predecir problemas de conciencia fonologica en segundo grado - aun cuando se tomaron en cuenta las diferencias en conciencia silabica y fonologica tempranas. Los resultados sugieren que la calidad de las representaciones fonologicas en el lexico mental es determinante tanto del desarrollo de la conciencia segmental (por ej., fonologica) como de la adquisicion de habilidades fonologicas en la lectura.

DIESER ARTIKEL stellt die Ergebnisse einer Langzeitstudie mit Kindern von dyslexischen und normal-lesenden Eltern vor. Die Kinder wurden mit Beginn des Kindergartens (im Alter von sechs, ein Jahr vor Beginn des Leseunterrichts in Danemark) bis zum Eintritt in das zweite Schuljahr betreut. Es wurde festgestellt, das Kinder von dyslexischen Eltern einem erhohten Risiko der Dyslexie unterliegen (im Wahrscheinlichkeitsverhaltnis von 4.3), wobei Dyslexie als unzureichende phonologische Wiedergabe definiert wurde (Leseschwache mit nicht-bestimmbaren Worten und scheinbaren Gleichlauten bzw. Pseudo-Homophonie bei realen Worten). Alle im Kindergarten ermittelten sprachlichen Masnahmen erwiesen sich als statistisch bedeutende Hinweise auf Dyslexie. Logistische Regressionsanalysen mit schrittweisen, ruckwirkenden Betrachtungsablaufen indizierten drei wesentliche Masnahmen, die unabhangig voneinander zur Bestimmung von Dyslexie beitragen: Buchstabieren, phonemische Unterscheidung und Deutlichkeit der phonologischen Ausdrucksweisen. Die systematische Bemessung der Deutlichkeit der phonologischen Reprasentation trug ebenfalls wesentlich zur Bestimmung eines voraussichtlich auftretenden geschwachten phonemischen Bewustseins bei Schulern in der zweiten Klasse bei, sogar wenn Unterschiede in der fruhen Erkenntnis von Silbenbildung und phonemischer Wahrnehmung, Artikulation bzw. Wortgliederung, sowie in produktiver und rezeptiver Wortbildung ermittelt wurden. Die Ergebnisse weisen daraufhin, das die Qualitat der phonologischen Vorstellungen im mentalen Lexikon ein Bestimmungsfaktor in der Entwicklung beider segmentaler (z.B. phonemischer) Aufnahmefahigkeiten und der Aneignung von phonologischen Wiedergabefahigkeiten beim Lesen ist.

CE PAPIER presente des resultats provenant d'une etude longitudinale d'enfants de parents dyslexiques ou lisant normalement. Les enfants ont ete suivis du debut du jardin d'enfants (a six ans, un an avant l'enseignement de la lecture au Danemark) jusqu'au commencement de la seconde annee. On a trouve que les enfants de parents dyslexiques presentent un plus grand risque de dyslexie (4.3 fois plus) quand la dyslexie est definie comme un faible recodage phonologique (faible lecture de non-mots et de pseudo-homophones de mots reels). Tous les indicateurs langagiers au jardin d'enfants sont des predicteurs statistiquement significatifs de dyslexie. Des analyses de regression avec selection retroactive variable par variable ont montre que trois mesures contribuent independam ment a predire la dyslexie: la denomination de lettres, l'identification de phonemes, et la precision dans les representations phonologiques. La mesure de la precision dans les representations phonologiques contribue aussi de maniere significative a predire une faible conscience phonemique en deuxieme annee, meme si les differences initiales de conscience de la syllabe et du phoneme, de l'articulation, et du vocabulaire emis ou produit sont prises en consideration. Les resultats suggerent que la qualite des representations phonologiques dans le lexique interne est un determinant du developpement tant de la conscience segmentale (par exemple du phoneme) que de l'acquisition des habiletes de recodage phonologique en lecture."

This aspect was found to have implications for the strategy of reading, but whether reading of different orthographies also relies differently on cognitive skills is yet unclear. This question was examined mainly by cross-participant-and-language investigations in which orthographic variation is hard to isolate. This work examined this topic using a within-participant-and-language study design. Hebrew readers in Grades 3 and 4 were longitudinally tested because in these grades they are engaged in reading three forms of script, transcribing the same language and varying in spelling–sound relations, as they gradually progress from reading a transparent orthography to reading an opaque one. Phonological awareness explained a considerable amount of variance in accuracy in reading all forms of script across these two years. The relations of morphological awareness with accuracy in reading the three forms of script were similar; however, the results suggested that these may be associated with the course of transition. Phonological awareness and rapid naming were similarly related to fluency in reading all forms of script when equivalent proficiencies in reading of these scripts were achieved. At this stage, the relations of vocabulary with fluency in reading and comprehension of the transparent and opaque forms of script were also much alike. Phonological memory explained a modest, but significant, amount of variance in comprehension of the unpointed script alone. These results suggest that, apart from phonological memory, the cognitive skills tested in this study serve as a common cognitive infrastructure in reading orthographies varying in spelling–sound transparency."

Logan, Christopher Schatschneider","Reading ability is comprised of several component processes. In particular, the connection between the visual and verbal systems has been demonstrated to play an important role in the reading process. The present study provides a review of the existing literature on the visual verbal connection as measured by two tasks, rapid serial naming and isolated (or discrete-trial) naming speed, as they relate to reading ability. For each identified study, a secondary data analysis was conducted using the provided correlations between serial naming, isolated naming, and reading. The same analysis was repeated for average population-level correlations among these constructs using meta-analytic weighting techniques. Results suggested that isolated naming acts as a suppressor variable in the relation of serial naming with reading, indicating that there exists at least one cognitive component of the serial naming task that is predictive of reading but is not shared with isolated naming speed. The effect has several implications for understanding the underlying cognitive components reading ability, which are discussed."

A deficit in automatization of verbal responses to visual stimuli, not restricted to symbols, correlates specifically with dyslexia.

A sample pool of 1412 kindergartners took a Digit RAN subtask and were then grouped into the slow naming group (SNG) or the matched subject group (MSG). The two groups were controlled for gender, age, socio-economic status and non-verbal intelligence. They then took the RAN task, a Phonological Awareness Test and the Graded Character Recognition Test in each of the next three years. The results of statistical analyses showed that the third-grade SNG children were more likely to be identified as reading disabled in comparison to their MSG counterparts. Regardless of the grade the SNG participants were in, RAN remained a significant predictor of character recognition in the three years of investigation. However, this predictive relationship did not apply to the MSG."

Blackburn,The purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with reading performance in children exposed to domestic violence. Twenty children ages 6 to 9 who had been exposed to domestic violence were tested on reading and prereading skills using the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests-Revised and the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing. Results indicated that psychological aggression of the mother toward her partner and externalizing behavior problems were strongly negatively correlated with reading scores. The number of months at the current residence in the past year was positively correlated with reading performance. Physical assault by the partner toward the mother was not significantly correlated with reading skills. Higher incidence of risk factors was significantly associated with risk for reading disabilities.

The results indicated that both the normal and the SLI children continued to develop skills in receptive and expressive language and speech articulation across the 3- to 4-year period intervening between evaluations. Overall, however, the SLI children appeared to develop language skills at a slower than normal rate and 80% of them remained language impaired at Time 2.

We hypothesized that this shift should be reflected in a concomitant shift in reading-related cognitive functions. The current study investigated the cognitive dynamics underlying reading development in a large school sample ranging from beginning to experienced readers. The results showed that phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN) contributed substantially to reading fluency over all six primary school grades. However, the relationship between PA and word (but not pseudoword) reading fluency decreased as a function of reading experience, whereas the relationship between RAN and word reading fluency increased gradually. Moreover, this cognitive shift was most pronounced for high-frequency words. The results seem to point to the development of one (and only one) reading network for all types of words in which processing load or type of processing depends on word familiarity and amount of reading experience."

The children (33 girls, 86 boys) ranged in age from 7.5 years to 12 years. Variables chosen for study included simple and complex phonological processing, speech rate, continuous naming speed, running memory span, serial memory span, and mental addition. Evidence is presented that the two poor reader groups are distinguishable. Unlike the dyslexic group, the slow/borderline group did not differ from the ADD group on three key measures: simple auditory phonological sensitivity, continuous naming speed, and running memory span. Stepwise regression to predict word list reading level showed that once age and verbal IQ were removed (51% of variance), these three key measures accounted for an additional 22% of the variance ..."

Bowey, Michaela McGuigan, Annette Ruschena","The current study examined several alternative explanations of the association between serial naming speed within fourth-grade children by determining the extent to which the association between word reading and naming speed for letters and numbers is mediated by global processing speed, alphanumeric symbol processing efficiency and phonological processing ability. Children were given multiple measures of key constructs, i.e. word-level reading, serial naming of both alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric items, phonological processing ability, articulation rate and global processing speed. The robust association between alphanumeric naming speed and reading within fourth-grade children was largely mediated by phonological processing ability. Markedly different patterns of results were observed for naming speed for letters and digits and naming speed for colours and pictures in children of this age. Relative to the latter, alphanumeric naming speed better assesses an underlying phonological processing ability that is common to word-reading ability. We argue that item identification processes contribute little to individual differences in alphanumeric naming speed within relatively proficient readers and that the extent to which alphanumeric naming speed primarily reflects phonological processing is likely to vary with the level of overlearning of letters and numbers and their names."

Relationships among reading skills, autistic symptomatology, and language-related abilities were also investigated. The results indicate that both reading accuracy and comprehension are deficient but that the development of these skills progresses in a consistently parallel fashion to what would be expected from a normative sample of same age peers. Language-related abilities were strongly associated with reading skills. Unlike individuals with SLI only, those with SLI and additional autistic symptomatology had adequate reading accuracy but did not differ from the individuals with SLI only in reading comprehension. They exhibited a significant gap between what they could read and what they could understand when reading. These findings provide strong evidence that individuals with SLI experience continued, long-term deficits in reading skills from childhood to adolescence."

Both BM and FM thresholds improved with training, and by the 2nd test session, FM thresholds were in the adult range. There were marked individual differences on BM and Δf 0, and, for both tasks, performance correlated with Tallal’s Auditory Repetition Task administered 2 years previously. However, no auditory measure gave significant differences between LI and control groups; performance was influenced more by nonverbal than language ability. Some children did have a stable pattern of poor performance on certain auditory tasks, but their good FM detection raised questions about whether processing of auditory temporal information is abnormal.

Thomson, Victoria Leong, Usha Goswami","The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of two auditory processing interventions for developmental dyslexia, one based on rhythm and one based on phonetic training. Thirty-three children with dyslexia participated and were assigned to one of three groups (a) a novel rhythmic processing intervention designed to highlight auditory rhythmic information in non-speech and speech stimuli; (b) a commercially-available phoneme discrimination intervention; and (c) a no-intervention control. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks. Both interventions yielded equivalent and significant gains on measures of phonological awareness (at both rhyme and phoneme levels), with large effect sizes at the phoneme level. Both programs had medium effect sizes on literacy outcome measures, although gains were non-significant when compared to the controls. The data suggest that rhythmic training has an important role to play in developing the phonological skills that are critical for efficient literacy acquisition. It is suggested that combining both prosodic/rhythmic and phonemic cues in auditory training programs may offer advantages for children with developmental dyslexia. This may be especially true for those who appear resistant to conventional phonics training methods."

According to this definition, dyslexia is a developmental language disorder that involves a deficit(s) in phonological processing. This disorder manifests itself in various phonological difficulties as well as a specific reading disability."

Seymour, Shirley Hill","Abstract Current debate over the influence of phonological awareness on early reading development is polarised around small-unit (phoneme) processing and large-unit (onset-rime) processing. These opposing theories were contrasted by assessing the impact of pre-school phonological skills on reading amongst children experiencing their first year of formal instruction by a mixed method. Those beginning readers who could decode nonwords were found to have accomplished this by employing their letter-sound knowledge rather than by making analogies based on familiar rime units. Children displayed this pattern of performance regardless of their pre-school rhyming skills. Further investigations revealed that explicit awareness of onset and rime units was poor, even amongst children whose implicit rhyming skills were excellent. This evidence, together with the children's knowledge of orthographic units, was consistent with the view that letter-sound correspondences rather than onset or rime units formed the basis of their first attempts to utilise phonology in reading. The findings are discussed with reference to instructional influences on early reading and phonological awareness. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V."

The component processes of RAN that are responsible for its relationship with reading ability remain underspecified, however. We report a study on dyslexic and nondyslexic adult groups that experimentally manipulated RAN formats to elucidate how different components of RAN differentially influence dyslexic and nondyslexic performance. The dyslexic group showed a pervasive deficit in rapid access of individually presented items. Additionally, they showed a significant impairment when multiple items were presented, whereas nondyslexic readers showed marginal facilitation for this format. We discuss the implications of these findings with respect to reading-group differences in reading fluency."

A series of logistic regression analysis indicated three main findings. First, phonological awareness as a predictor of reading difficulties in the Scandinavian sample was time-limited to Grade 1, but remained as a significant predictor in the English-speaking sample. Second, phonological awareness predicted spelling difficulties similarly across orthographies. Third, preschool and kindergarten RAN was a significant predictor of reading and spelling difficulties at both Grades 1 and 2 across orthographies. The authors conclude that phonological awareness diminishes as a predictor of reading difficulties in transparent orthographies after the first years of schooling, that RAN is a better long term predictor of reading difficulties, and that phonological awareness is associated with spelling difficulties similarly in transparent and opaque orthographies."

A total of 1,529 children (5-to-6-year-olds) were tested on word reading twice, once at the beginning and once at the end of a kindergarten year. The mothers of the children (n = 1,529) answered a questionnaire on reading-related activities with their children at home (on shared reading, teaching letters, and the teaching of reading) and on their level of education, their child’s birth order, and the gender of the child. The results show that of the three reading-related activities, mothers’ teaching of reading is the best predictor of the development of reading skills among kindergarten children. The results also show that good reading skills at the beginning of the kindergarten year increase the maternal teaching of reading a child subsequently receives. The results further demonstrate that girls, firstborns, and children with more highly educated mothers are more likely to become good readers by the end of the kindergarten year."

Eden","Until recently, many thought developmental dyslexia was a behavioral disorder that primarily affected reading. In fact, it is a partly heritable condition, the clinical manifestations of which are extremely complex including deficits in reading, working memory, sensorimotor coordination, and early sensory processing. Even though extensive research has characterized these behavioral abnormalities carefully, the biological mechanisms of the clinical manifestations still are poorly understood. Recent research into both the nature of the structural and functional abnormalities in developmental dyslexia and the functional neuroanatomy of reading have rapidly advanced our understanding of the localization of the processes responsible for the signs and symptoms of dyslexia. This paper reviews recent evidence supporting a biological basis for developmental dyslexia."

Traditional letter and numeral identification assessments score children's responses as either correct or incorrect and this approach can underestimate what children know. The present study tested an assessment scale that scored three- and four-year-old children's (N = 69; M age = 49.17 months) responses along a continuum from no letter and numeral name knowledge, to using a mix of non-conventional and conventional names, through to full mastery. Compared to traditional scoring, the new scale was more comprehensive because it included more elements of each child's emerging knowledge of letter and numeral identification and was more sensitive to individual differences among children. The emergent print identification scale can be used to inform learning and teaching in the early years classroom and be used in early literacy research."

Children who participated in the study (N= 147) demonstrated profound sensorineural hearing loss and had used cochlear implants for between 6 months and 10 years. Educational programs that used an oral communication (OC) approach focused on the development of spoken language, whereas educational programs that used a total communication (TC) approach focused on the development of language using both signed and spoken language. Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) we compared the consonant-production accuracy, receptive spoken vocabulary, and expressive spoken and/or signed vocabulary skills, over time, of children who were enrolled in schools that used either OC or TC approaches, while controlling for a number of variables. These variables included age at implantation, preoperative aided speech detection thresholds, type of cochlear implant device used, and whether a complete or incomplete active electrode array was implanted. The results of this study indicated that as they used their implants the children demonstrated improved consonant-production accuracy and expressive and receptive vocabulary over time, regardless of whether their school employed a TC or OC teaching method. Furthermore, there appeared to be a complex relationship among children's performance with the cochlear implant, age at implantation, and communication/teaching strategy employed by the school. Controlling for all variables, children in OC programs demonstrated, on average, superior consonant-production accuracy, with significantly greater rates of improvement in consonant-production accuracy scores over time compared to children in TC programs. However, there was no significant difference between OC and TC groups in performance or rate of growth in consonant-production accuracy when children received their implants before the age of 5 years. There was no significant difference between the OC and TC groups in receptive spoken vocabulary scores or in rate of improvement over time. However, children in the TC group achieved significantly higher receptive spoken vocabulary scores than children in the OC group if they received their implant before the age of 5 years. The TC group demonstrated superior scores and rates of growth on the expressive vocabulary measure (spoken and/or signed) when compared to the OC group if they received their implants during their preschool or early elementary school years. There was no significant difference if the children received their implants during middle elementary school. Regardless of whether children were in the OC or TC group, children who received their implants during preschool demonstrated stronger performance, on average, on all measures over time than children who received their implants during their elementary school years. The results of this study suggest that children may benefit from using cochlear implants regardless of the communication strategy/teaching approach employed by their school program and that other considerations, such as the age at which children receive implants, are more important. Implications and future research needs are discussed."

The use of grapheme-phoneme correspondences was observed in a recognition memory task for pronounceable nonwords. The nonwords were presented in either the visual or auditory modality and had to be recognized immediately from the converse modality, thus necessitating decoding of stimuli across modalities. The use of grapheme-phoneme correspondences increased with reading age in the normal readers but not in the dyslexics. It was postulated that dyslexics have a specific difficulty in grapheme-phoneme conversion. For them an increase in reading age is attributable mainly to an increase in size of sight vocabulary."

Results indicate that while early childhood educators believe knowledge about teaching reading is ‘very important’ to their role, their understanding of literacy precursor skills was generally low. When observed teaching beginning reading, most participants demonstrated some capacity to plan and teach in an explicit way; however, their enacted practice was inconsistent with their teacher knowledge results.

Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for their deficits: (i) a speech-specific failure in phonological representation and (ii) a general deficit in auditory “temporal processing,” such that they cannot easily perceive the rapid spectral changes of formant transitions at the onset of stop-vowel syllables. To test these hypotheses, two groups of second-grade children (20 “good readers,” 20 “poor readers”), matched for age and intelligence, were selected to differ significantly on a /ba/–/da/ temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, said to be diagnostic of a temporal processing deficit. Three experiments then showed that the groups did not differ in: (i) TOJ when /ba/ and /da/ were paired with more easily discriminated syllables (/ba/–/sa/, /da/–/∳a/); (ii) discriminating nonspeech sine wave analogs of the second and third formants of /ba/ and /da/; (iii) sensitivity to brief transitional cues varying along a synthetic speech continuum. Thus, poor readers’ difficulties with /ba/–/da/ reflected perceptual confusion between phonetically similar, though phonologically contrastive, syllables rather than difficulty in perceiving rapid spectral changes. The results are consistent with a speech-specific, not a general auditory, deficit."

Jacobs, Robert C. Elston","Haseman and Elston (H-E) proposed a robust test to detect linkage between a quantitative trait and a genetic marker. In their method the squared sib-pair trait difference is regressed on the estimated proportion of alleles at a locus shared identical by descent by sib pairs. This method has recently been improved by changing the dependent variable from the squared difference to the mean-corrected product of the sib-pair trait values, a significantly positive regression indicating linkage. Because situations arise in which the original test is more powerful, a further improvement of the H-E method occurs when the dependent variable is changed to a weighted average of the squared sib-pair trait difference and the squared sib-pair mean-corrected trait sum. Here we propose an optimal method of performing this weighting for larger sibships, allowing for the correlation between pairs within a sibship. The optimal weights are inversely proportional to the residual variances obtained from the two different regressions based on the squared sib-pair trait differences and the squared sib-pair mean-corrected trait sums, respectively, allowing for correlations among sib pairs. The proposed method is compared with the existing extension of the H-E approach for larger sibships. Control of the type I error probabilities for sibships of any size can be improved by using a generalized estimating equation approach and the robust sandwich estimate of the variance, or a Monte-Carlo permutation test."

Here we report findings from two experiments in which two previously untested predictions derived from this anchoring hypothesis were tested: (a) that anchoring facilitates rapid naming and phonological short-term memory in children prior to the onset of formal reading instruction and (b) that anchoring makes a unique contribution to performance in two early predictors of reading (letter knowledge and phonological awareness). In line with those predictions, naming times were faster and memory spans were longer under conditions that encouraged the use of anchoring processes than under conditions that afforded little anchoring. Furthermore, performance in the anchoring-affording condition predicted significant amounts of variance in phonological awareness and letter knowledge even after controlling for the contribution of the conditions that did not afford anchoring. Therefore, we suggest that anchoring might contribute to the development of reading-related processes during the preschool years independent of the development of specific reading-related skills such as phonological processing."

Advances in mobile technology have led to alphabet books of an electronic format with accompanying sound, animations, and interactive hot spots. This study investigates the differential effectiveness of paper alphabet books and alphabet eBooks in training alphabetic knowledge in 4-year-olds. Three groups of approximately 30 children were assigned to one of three conditions: paper alphabet book, alphabet eBook, or storybook control. Book reading sessions composed of three to four children were run twice a week over eight weeks, with child-book behaviours coded at each session. Measures of early reading ability were collected pre and post-intervention. Children in all conditions improved over time in emergent literacy but no significant differences between conditions were found. Children using paper alphabet books were more likely to say letter names, and their time oriented to the books predicted post-test letter-name and phonological awareness after controlling for pre-test scores. In contrast, time oriented to the alphabet eBooks made no prediction to post-test sores. Preschoolers were observed using various paper/electronic ABC books in 16 sessions.Participants in the ebook condition were more engaged with the books.ABC ebook users frequently activated hotspots but rarely said object or letter names.Paper ABC book users more often named letters, along with corresponding objects.Engagement with paper ABC books but not ABC ebooks predicted post-test early literacy."

It is based on the most current theoretical model of intelligence, Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory. The broad CHC abilities measured on one or more of the WJ Tests are: Long-Term Retrieval ( Glr ), Auditory Processing ( Ga ), Fluid Reasoning ( Gf ), Processing Speed ( Gs ), Short-Term Memory ( Gsm ), Visual-Spatial Thinking ( Gv ), Comprehension-Knowledge ( Gc ), Reading-Writing ( Grw ), and Quantitative Knowledge ( Gq ). The WJ III proves to be a valuable diagnostic tool to be used to identify exceptional children including high incidence disabilities like head injury, Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD; low incidence disabilities such as visual impairment and autism; and gifted students including those with a learning disability. Higher education students have benefit from WJ III tests as well."

Klein, Ora Segal-Drori","The researchers addressed two questions: (1) Does maternal reading mediation and family home literacy environment (HLE) relate to children’s emergent literacy (EL) level? and (2) Do the relationships among these variables differ as a function of socioeconomic strata (SES) level. A total of 94 5–6-year-old children, 47 from low SES (LSES) and 47 from high (HSES) families, and their mothers participated. Mother–child interactions while reading an unfamiliar book were videotaped and their verbal expressions were coded for extracting maternal mediation level. Children’s independent EL level was assessed prior to the interaction. Compared with the LSES group, HSES children showed higher EL levels and their homes had a richer literacy environment. Maternal mediation level differed by SES: LSES mothers paraphrased text more often; HSES mothers’ higher mediation level included a discussion of the written system and making connections beyond the text. In the HSES group, maternal mediation level and HLE related to children’s EL; no such relationships appeared in the LSES group. Results are discussed in terms of children’s socio-economic background and their reading experiences. Implications for researchers and educational practices about the relationships between children’s literacy development, SES, HLE, and parental mediation are discussed."

Although quite a few studies report immigrant parents' belief and perspectives of their children's second language reading and writing, it remains unknown for school teachers and second literacy specialists the steps that immigrant parents take to improve their children's second language learning after the children leave school. This longitudinal case study intends to fill the gap by profiling an ESL child's early second language writing development, from day one of the child's American schooling to the time when the child received above grade level instruction. The detailed data in naturalistic settings are valuable evidence of effective parental intervention in second language acquisition. Due to the parents' linguistic and educational background, their home literacy practices at the early stage of a child's second writing development are invaluable for classroom teachers. Some of their strategies are also applicable for immigrant parents who don't know where or how to start helping their children learn their second language well."

They were compared to a control group of 14 typically developing 6- and 7-year-olds of comparable word reading abilities. Results showed that, although individuals with Down syndrome had impaired nonword reading and phonological awareness skills, the same relationship held between these two abilities as was observed in the group of typically developing children. Moreover, individuals with Down syndrome read at least as well as the typically developing children when the task required a visual reading strategy (reading irregular words). Learning outcomes: (a) understanding of the main issues related to the development of reading skills in Down syndrome; (b) understanding of the role played by phonological awareness in learning to read; (c) understanding of the importance for education of the strong relationship between phonological awareness and reading skills in Down syndrome."

Parents in three groups (119 mothers, 5 fathers) were coached to mediate child learning, respectively, in: interactive storybook reading, writing, or visuomotor skills. A group-specific workshop was followed by 7 weeks of tri-weekly structured dyadic interactions and weekly tutorial home visits. A fourth group (control) received no intervention. Results showed implementation success: Mothers coached in interactive storybook reading or writing mediation improved in the coached activity from pretest to immediate posttest and to delayed posttest. Interactive storybook reading improved less for older than younger children, whereas writing mediation improved more for older than younger children. No transfer emerged from one activity to the other: Coaching on reading had no effect on writing or visuomotor skills, and coaching of writing had an effect only on writing. Children’s alphabetic skills were enhanced in the writing mediation-coached group, whereas linguistic competencies, unexpectedly, were not enhanced in the interactive storybook reading-coached group. The significance of writing mediation as a dyadic activity promoting literacy is emphasized."

Wagner, Mike Balthazor, Sally Hurley, Sharon Morgan, Carol A. Rashotte, Rebecca Shaner, Karen Simmons, Scott Stage","We investigated the nature of prereaders' phonological processing abilities by giving 111 preschool nonreaders a battery of 12 phonological processing tasks. Each task represented one of three kinds of phonological processing: phonological awareness, phonological coding in lexical access, and phonological coding in working memory. Five alternative models of the nature of prereaders' phonological processing abilities were tested by their fit to the covariances among phonological processing tasks after IQ had been partialled out. Our results provide evidence for two coherent phonological processing abilities in prereaders that are independent of IQ: phonological coding in working memory and phonological coding in lexical access . Performance on common measures of phonological awareness appears to be a function of efficiency of phonological coding in working memory. Our results call into question the view that phonological awareness, narrowly defined, is what is being measured by common-awareness measures and, by implication, that phonological awareness in and of itself is consequential to successful acquisition of beginning reading skills. Rather, the ability to make productive use of phonological information in coding information may be what really matters, and whether or not awareness enables use is an important unresolved issue. We conclude by considering the theoretical and practical implications of our findings."

Blachman","Recent evidence suggests that the ability to segment words into phonemes is significantly related to reading success, and that training in phoneme segmentation appears to have a positive influence on beginning reading. In this study, we evaluated the effect on reading readiness of phoneme segmentation training in kindergarten. Ninety nonreaders with PPVT-R standard scores of 78 or higher were randomly selected from six kindergarten classrooms and assigned to one of three treatment conditions: a) phoneme segmentation group; b) language activities group (control group I); and c) no intervention (control group II). The phoneme segmentation group received seven weeks of instruction in segmentation and in letter names and sounds. Also for seven weeks, the language activities group received the identical instruction in letter names and sounds and additional language activities. Prior to the intervention, the three groups did not differ in age, sex, race, PPVT-R phoneme segmentation, letter name and letter sound knowledge, or reading ability. After the intervention, the phoneme segmentation group outperformed both control groups on phoneme segmentation and reading measures. This study provides additional strong support for including phoneme segmentation training in the kindergarten curriculum. Clinical suggestions for teachers are included."

However, the degree to which dorsal stream deficits play a causal role in reading failure has not been established. This study used coherent motion and visual frequency doubling to examine whether dorsal stream sensitivity measured before the commencement of formal reading instruction can predict emerging literacy skills in Grade 1. We demonstrate that over age, IQ and Kindergarten Letter knowledge, pre-reading measures of dorsal stream functioning, as assessed by frequency doubling sensitivity, could predict early literacy skills. These findings suggest that the relationship between dorsal stream functioning and poor reading skills exists before children learn to read, strengthening the claim that dorsal stream deficits may play a contributing role in reading failure."

The outcomes used in the analysis were dependent on the aims of the study; only the primary effects of intervention are considered in this review. These were investigated at the level of the target of therapy, measures of overall linguistic development, and broader measures of linguistic functioning taken from parenzt report or language samples. Thirty-six articles reporting 33 different trials were found. Of these articles, 25 provided sufficient information for use in the rneta-analyses; however, only 13 of these, spanning 25 years, were considered to be sufficiently similar to be combined. The results indicated that speech and language therapy might be effective for children with phonological or expressive vocabulary difficulties. There was mixed evidence concerning the effectiveness of intervention for children with expressive syntax difficulties and little evidence available considering the effectiveness of intervention for children with receptive language difficulties.

Rickard Liow, Stephanie H. M. Yeong","For bilingual children, the results of language and literacy screening tools are often hard to interpret. This leads to late referral for specialized assessment or inappropriate interventions. To facilitate the early identification of reading difficulties in English, we developed a method of screening that is theory-driven yet suitable for first-language (L1) and second-language learners of English. We administered five conventional tests (phonological awareness, vocabulary, Wide Range Achievement Test–4 [WRAT-4] spelling, letter identification, rapid naming of digits) to 127 five-year-olds (60 English-L1, 67 Mandarin-L1) about 6 months after they started kindergarten, and used the WRAT-4 word reading score 6 months later as the outcome measure. Consistent with previous research, and with children with reading disabilities defined as below the 25 percentile on the reading outcome, logistic regression revealed that the full set of screening measures predicted reading disability status.

577,2016336040,hierarchical regression analysis in structural equation modeling,1999,10.1080/10705519909540128,Structural Equation Modeling,P.F. de Jong,"In a hierarchical or fixed-order regression analysis, the independent variables are entered into the regression equation in a prespecified order. Such an analysis is often performed when the extra amount of variance accounted for in a dependent variable by a specific independent variable is the main focus of interest (e.g., Cohen & Cohen, 1983). For example, in the area of reading achievement, there is a general interest in the specific abilities that predict reading development. Because these specific abilities are often correlated with more general abilities, such as verbal intelligence, the latter abilities are controlled for first (e.g., Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994). An additional reason for performing a hierarchical regression analysis is that, in these research applications, as well as in many others, the independent variables are often highly correlated. When correlated independent variables are included simultaneously in the regression model, multicollinearity arises (Cohen & Cohen, 1983). Though regularly used with observed variables, hierarchical regression analysis has not been performed with latent variables. In most applications of structural equation modeling (SEM), the latent predictors have been entered simultaneously into the regression model, although in several cases hierarchical regression analysis would have been the more appropriate approach (e.g., Guthrie et al., 1998; Normandeau & Guay, 1998; Wagner et al., 1994; Wagner et al., 1997). In this article we describe how a hierarchical regression analysis may be conducted in SEM. The main procedure proposed is to perform a Cholesky or triangular decomposition of the intercorrelations among the latent predictors (Harman, 1976; Loehlin, 1996). First the procedure is described and then an example of a hierarchical regression analysis with latent variables is given. Copyright © 1999, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc."

Spinks, Guinevere F. Eden, Charles A. Perfetti, Wai Ting Siok","Language development entails four fundamental and interactive abilities: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Over the past four decades, a large body of evidence has indicated that reading acquisition is strongly associated with a child's listening skills, particularly the child's sensitivity to phonological structures of spoken language. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that the close relationship between reading and listening is manifested universally across languages and that behavioral remediation using strategies addressing phonological awareness alleviates reading difficulties in dyslexics. The prevailing view of the central role of phonological awareness in reading development is largely based on studies using Western (alphabetic) languages, which are based on phonology. The Chinese language provides a unique medium for testing this notion, because logographic characters in Chinese are based on meaning rather than phonology. Here we show that the ability to read Chinese is strongly related to a child's writing skills and that the relationship between phonological awareness and Chinese reading is much weaker than that in reports regarding alphabetic languages. We propose that the role of logograph writing in reading development is mediated by two possibly interacting mechanisms. The first is orthographic awareness, which facilitates the development of coherent, effective links among visual symbols, phonology, and semantics; the second involves the establishment of motor programs that lead to the formation of long-term motor memories of Chinese characters. These findings yield a unique insight into how cognitive systems responsible for reading development and reading disability interact, and they challenge the prominent phonological awareness view."

We argue that (1) errors in temporal order judgment of both syllables and tones reflect difficulty in identifying similar (and so readily confusable) stimuli rapidly, not in judging their temporal order; (2) difficulty in identifying similar syllables or tones rapidly stem from independent deficits in speech and nonspeech discriminative capacity, not from a general deficit in rate of auditory perception; and (3) the results of dichotic experiments and studies of aphasics purporting to demonstrate left-hemisphere specialization for nonspeech auditory temporal perception are inconclusive. The paper supports its arguments with data from a recent control study. We conclude that, on the available evidence, the phonological deficit of impaired readers cannot be traced to any co-occurring nonspeech deficits so far observed and is phonetic in origin, but that its full nature, origin, and extent remain to be determined."

PA and RAN were measured in kindergarten and Grade 1, while word recognition, phonological decoding, and spelling were measured in kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2. In general, high stability was observed for the various reading and spelling measures, such that little additional variance was left open for PA and RAN. However, results demonstrated that RAN was more related to reading than spelling across orthographies, with the opposite pattern shown for PA. In addition, tests of measurement invariance show that the factor loadings of each observed indicator on the latent PA factor was the same across U.S./Australia and Scandinavia. Similar findings were obtained for RAN. In general, tests of structural invariance show that models of early literacy development are highly transferable across languages."

Reiss, Lisa S. Freund, Lynne C. Huffman","Background There remains some variance in cognitive ability that is unexplained in children with fragile-X syndrome (FXS). Studies in typically developing children suggest that family environment might be one contributor to this unexplained variance. However, the effect of family environment in relation to cognition in atypical children with FXS has been relatively unexplored to date.



Methods The present authors examined the putative genetic and environmental factors associated with cognition in a group of age-matched children consisting of 26 females with FXS and 31 typically developing children. All subjects were administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – Revised; and the subjects’ parents were administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale – Revised, and completed the Hollingshead Index of Social Status and the Moos & Moos Family Environment Scale.



Results Using a multiple regression analytic strategy, the present authors found that family environment contributed significantly to cognitive abilities in typically developing girls, but did not have a unique contribution to cognitive abilities in girls with FXS. There was a suggestion that, for girls with FXS, socio-economic status, a measure of sociocultural environment, was correlated with IQ.



Conclusions The present study provides a basis for future research on the environmental contributions to cognitive abilities, particularly work related to verbal cognition."

The authors addressed this long-standing debate by examining how a large-scale computational model based on connectionist principles would solve the problem and comparing the model's performance to people's. In contrast to previous models, the present model uses an architecture in which meanings are jointly determined by the 2 components, with the division of labor between them affected by the nature of the mappings between codes. The model is consistent with a variety of behavioral phenomena, including the results of studies of homophones and pseudohomophones thought to support other theories, and illustrates how efficient processing can be achieved using multiple simultaneous constraints."

The imperative to discover the genetic and environmental risk factors for ADHD is motivating the search for quantifiable intermediate constructs, termed endophenotypes. In this selective review, we conclude that such endophenotypes should be solidly grounded in the neurosciences. We propose that three such endophenotypes — a specific abnormality in reward-related circuitry that leads to shortened delay gradients, deficits in temporal processing that result in high intrasubject intertrial variability, and deficits in working memory — are most amenable to integrative collaborative approaches that aim to uncover the causes of ADHD."

This paper examines what the relationships are between FRD and these skills, and whether deficits in speech, language and phonological processing fully account for the increased risk of dyslexia in children with FRD. One hundred and fifty-three 4–6-year-old children, 44 of whom had FRD, completed a battery of speech, language, phonology and literacy tasks. Word reading and spelling were retested 6 months later, and text reading accuracy and reading comprehension were tested 3 years later. The children with FRD were at increased risk of developing difficulties in reading accuracy, but not reading comprehension. Four groups were compared: good and poor readers with and without FRD. In most cases good readers outperformed poor readers regardless of family history, but there was an effect of family history on naming and nonword repetition regardless of literacy outcome, suggesting a role for speech production skills as an endophenotype of dyslexia. Phonological processing predicted spelling, while language predicted text reading accuracy and comprehension. FRD was a significant additional predictor of reading and spelling after controlling for speech production, language and phonological processing, suggesting that children with FRD show additional difficulties in literacy that cannot be fully explained in terms of their language and phonological skills."

The contributions of RAN, verbal ability, and phonological awareness to the prediction of phonological and orthographic skills from the 1st to the 2nd grade were examined. Both RAN (digits and letters) and phoneme awareness accounted for independent variance in later reading scores, even when vocabulary and prior reading skill were entered 1st in the regression analysis. RAN was a stronger predictor than phoneme awareness for 3 tasks in which orthographic information is critical (orthographic choice, word-likeness judgment, and exception word pronunciation), whereas the opposite held true for nonword reading and paragraph comprehension.

Measures of linguistic proficiency (vocabulary and grammatical knowledge) were consistently higher in English and remained so even after 5 years of immersion education in French. Measures of metalinguistic ability (letter fluency and ignoring semantic anomalies in sentence judgments) in French improved significantly over the two grades studied and closed the gap (letter fluency) or caught up with (sentence judgments) similar performance in English. This dissociation between developmental trajectories for linguistic and metalinguistic development is exactly the pattern expected for fully bilingual children, endorsing immersion education as a route to bilingualism."

Studies of children purported to evidence nonverbal learning disabilities are reviewed and compared with the results from studies of adults with right hemisphere damage. Specific subtypes of nonverbal learning disabilities are reviewed. The need for a diagnostic nosology and improved and validated intervention techniques is stressed as is early identification of these types of specific nonverbal learning disabilities"

With children in first grade and their parents (Expt 1), we established that PE shows links to socio-economic status. In a longitudinal study conducted in Grade 1 (Expt 2), a hierarchical regression indicated that PE predicts variance in word reading after age, phonological skills, and letter knowledge have been partialled out. In older children (Expt 3), and only in Grades 4–5, PE accounts for unique variance in word recognition, in word spelling, and, finally, in vocabulary, after chronological and lexical age have been controlled for."

A range of cognitive and linguistic skills were assessed in a sample of 137 eight-year-old children with SLI at the beginning of the school year, and 6 months later on word decoding and reading comprehension. The cognitive and linguistic measures revealed four factors that were called language, speech, short-term memory, and phonological awareness. Structural equation modeling showed word decoding to be predicted by speech, short-term memory, and phonological awareness, whereas reading comprehension was predicted by word decoding skills and short-term memory. It can be concluded that in children with SLI variations in early word decoding are mostly determined by speech abilities and short-term memory, and to a lesser extent by phonological awareness. Moreover, reading comprehension turns out to be highly dependent on word decoding and short-term memory."

The results of the segmenting study indicated that: (1) segmenting did not affect reading performance of students without disabilities; suggesting that it does not compromise the validity of reading assessment; (2) segmenting did not affect reading performance of students with disabilities; and (3) the segmented version had a higher reliability for students with disabilities without affecting the reliability for students without disabilities.

This skill is based on previously established memory representations of common letter patterns. The ability to form these memory representations may be impaired in some poor readers, particularly readers with naming speed deficits (NSD). This study explored factors that influence letter processing and the subsequent formation of memory representations of letter strings in children with and without a NSD. Children were presented with a letter string, followed by a probe unit that was either a single letter, a two-letter cluster, or a repetition of the whole string. Children indicated whether or not the probe had been present in the preceding string. Two factors were manipulated: (a) amount of time to process the initial letter string, and (b) level of orthographic structure present in the letter string. Results indicated that overall, children with NSD performed less accurately than children without NSD. However, children with NSD showed no differential benefit in performance as a result of longer time to process a letter string. In addition, all readers were able to make use of the orthographic structure in a letter string to aid performance. Implications of results for establishing memory representations of letter strings are discussed."

Twenty Chinese dyslexic children in Hong Kong were compared with 20 average readers of the same age (CA controls) and 20 average readers of the same reading level (RL controls) in naming speed (naming digits, colours, pictures, and Chinese characters) and phonological memory skills (digit repetition, word repetition, and nonword repetition). The results showed that the naming speed of Chinese dyslexic children was significantly slower than that of their CA controls in all the naming tasks, but similar to that of their RL controls. The dyslexic children also performed significantly worse than both CA and RL controls in all the phonological memory tasks. These findings suggest that Chinese dyslexic children have naming-speed deficits and phonological memory deficits like their alphabetic counterparts."

Kindergartners overused letters from their own first names (or commonly used nicknames) when spelling. Kindergartners with longer names, who had more own-name letters available for intrusions, tended to produce longer spellings than did children with shorter names. Moreover, the spellings of kindergartners with long names tended to contain a lower proportion of phonetically reasonable letters than did the spellings of children with short names. These effects appeared to be confined to children who read below the first grade level. The results support the view that children’s own names play a special role in the acquisition of literacy. They further show that children choose letters in a way that reflects their experience with the letters."

It is unknown, however, whether these differences in structural connectivity are related to the cause of dyslexia or if they are consequences of reading difficulty (e.g., less reading experience or compensatory brain organization). Here, in 40 kindergartners who had received little or no reading instruction, we examined the relation between behavioral predictors of dyslexia and white matter organization in left arcuate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and the parietal portion of the superior longitudinal fasciculus using probabilistic tractography. Higher composite phonological awareness scores were significantly and positively correlated with the volume of the arcuate fasciculus, but not with other tracts. Two other behavioral predictors of dyslexia, rapid naming and letter knowledge, did not correlate with volumes or diffusion values in these tracts. The volume and fractional anisotropy of the left arcuate showed a particularly strong positive correlation with a phoneme blending test. Whole-brain regressions of behavioral scores with diffusion measures confirmed the unique relation between phonological awareness and the left arcuate. These findings indicate that the left arcuate fasciculus, which connects anterior and posterior language regions of the human brain and which has been previously associated with reading ability in older individuals, is already smaller and has less integrity in kindergartners who are at risk for dyslexia because of poor phonological awareness. These findings suggest a structural basis of behavioral risk for dyslexia that predates reading instruction."

Data from cross-sectional, longitudinal, and cross-linguistic studies are reviewed supporting the presence of 2 single-deficit subtypes with more limited reading impairments and 1 double-deficit subtype with more pervasive and severe impairments. Naming-speed and phonological-awareness variables contribute uniquely to different aspects of reading according to this conception, with a model of visual letter naming illustrating both the multicomponential nature of naming speed and why naming speed Should not be subsumed under phonological processes. Two hypotheses concerning relationships between naming-speed processes and reading are considered. The implications of processing speed as a second core deficit in dyslexia are described for diagnosis and intervention."

Three groups of 15 children each—those with dyslexia, age-matched (AM) controls, and reading-matched (RM) controls—participated. Dyslexia was diagnosed at 8 years of age. All children were tested on phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming (RAN), morphological awareness, word reading, and vocabulary knowledge in both Chinese and English and also speed of processing skill. AM controls outperformed the group with dyslexia on all measures except for phonological awareness, English word reading, and vocabulary. However, those with dyslexia and AM controls developed at a similar rate across all reading-related skills from 6 to 8 years of age. Compared with the RM controls, the group with dyslexia scored higher in phonological awareness, morphological awareness, and vocabulary knowledge in both Chinese and English and also in English word reading but scored similarly in RAN. Children with dyslexia, thus, manifested clear difficulties in Chinese vocabulary knowledge, morphological awareness, and RAN as well as general speed of processing, representing a developmental lag in cognitive skills. Among these, RAN deficits are likely to be the most severe deficits in Chinese children with dyslexia."

Figueredo,"Currently, there is a practical demand and necessity for research on how English-as-a-second language (ESL) learners acquire literacy skills, such as spelling. One important issue of this research agenda is how ESL learners apply first-language knowledge to learning to spell in English. Twenty-seven studies were reviewed that investigated the influence of the first language on ESL learners’ development of English spelling skill. Evidence was found for both positive and negative transfer of first-language knowledge and processes to ESL learners’ English spelling. These results are in agreement with theoretical propositions about the interdependence between first- and second-language academic skills [e.g., Cummins, J. (1981). In California State Department of Education (Ed.), Schooling and language minority students: A theoretical framework (pp. 3–49). Los Angeles: Evaluation, Dissemination, and Assessment Center, California State University, Los Angeles]. The findings are discussed in relation to the ESL learner’s first-language proficiency level and distance between first language and English. Comparisons are drawn between ESL learners’ and English monolinguals’ spelling development and suggestions for future research are provided."

Although visual analysis of the data showed an increase in level and trend for the kindergarten participant, data were variable for the first grade participant who was referred for special education services during the intervention. Mean percentage of non-overlapping data (PND) was 94% for the kindergarten student and 98% for the first grade student.

Carpenter","Individual differences in reading comprehension may reflect differences in working memory capacity, specifically in the trade-off between its processing and storage functions. A poor reader's processes may be inefficient, so that they lessen the amount of additional information that can be maintained in working memory. A test with heavy processing and storage demands was devised to measure this trade-off. Subjects read aloud a series of sentences and then recalled the final word of each sentence. The reading span, the number of final words recalled, varied from two to five for 20 college students. This span correlated with three reading comprehension measures, including verbal SAT and tests involving fact retrieval and pronominal reference. Similar correlations were obtained with a listening span task, showing that the correlation is not specific to reading. These results were contrasted with traditional digit span and word span measures which do not correlate with comprehension."

Bus","This research synthesis examines whether the association between print exposure and components of reading grows stronger across development. We meta-analyzed 99 studies (N = 7,669) that focused on leisure time reading of (a) preschoolers and kindergartners, (b) children attending Grades 1-12, and (c) college and university students. For all measures in the outcome domains of reading comprehension and technical reading and spelling, moderate to strong correlations with print exposure were found. The outcomes support an upward spiral of causality: Children who are more proficient in comprehension and technical reading and spelling skills read more; because of more print exposure, their comprehension and technical reading and spelling skills improved more with each year of education. For example, in preschool and kindergarten print exposure explained 12% of the variance in oral language skills, in primary school 13%, in middle school 19%, in high school 30%, and in college and university 34%. Moderate associations of print exposure with academic achievement indicate that frequent readers are more successful students. Interestingly, poor readers also appear to benefit from independent leisure time reading. We conclude that shared book reading to preconventional readers may be part of a continuum of out-of-school reading experiences that facilitate children's language, reading, and spelling achievement throughout their development."

One-hundred and ninety-six 5- to 6-year-old children were tested in October and April of their preschool year and again in the first grade. Data included measures of reading ability and its cognitive and social antecedents, which were analyzed using Simplex and Piecewise Growth Curve Modeling. The results showed that during the preschool year individual differences in reading grew larger and that this growth was faster among those who entered preschool with well-developed skills. However, during the first grade individual differences in reading diminished. The results suggest that systematic reading instruction in primary school education is more beneficial for children with less developed literacy skills, whereas children with more developed reading skills gain relatively less from reading instruction in the first grade.

ESTE ESTUDIO investigo el curso evolutivo de las habilidades de lectura en ninos de pre-escolar y escuela primaria, asi como los antecedentes cognitivos y sociales de dicho desarrollo. Ciento noventa y seis ninos de 5 a 6 anos fueron evaluados en octubre y abril en pre-escolar y nuevamente en primer grado. Los datos incluyeron medidas de habilidad de lectura y sus antecedentes cognitivos y sociales y fueron analizados usando el metodo “Simplex and Piecewise Growth Curve Modeling.” Los resultados mostraron que, durante el ano de pre-escolar las diferencias individuales en lectura aumentaron y que este crecimiento fue mas rapido entre aquellos que entraron a preescolar con habilidades bien desarrolladas. Sin embargo, durante el primer grado, las diferencias individuales en lectura disminuyeron. Los resultados sugieren que la ensenanza sistematica de la lectura en la educacion primaria es mas beneficiosa para los ninos con habilidades de lectoescritura menos desarrolladas; en tanto que los ninos con habilidades de lectura mas desarrolladas obtienen relativamente menos beneficios de la ensenanza de la lectura en primer grado.

Einhundertsechsundneunzig funf bis sechs Jahre alte Kinder wurden im Oktober und im April wahrend ihres Vorschuljahres und dann nochmals in der ersten Klasse gepruft. Die Daten umfassten das Ermessen der Lesefahigkeit und deren kognitiven und sozialen Antezedentien, die mittels Nutzung der “Simplex- und Piecewise” Wachstumsmodellkurven analysiert wurden. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, das sich wahrend des Vorschuljahres individuelle Differenzen im Lesen verbesserten und das dieser Zuwachs bei jenen, die mit bereits gut entwickelten Leistungen in der Vorschule begannen, schneller vonstatten ging. Jedoch verringerten sich individuelle Differenzen wahrend der ersten Klasse.

Dickinson, Deborah Wells Rowe","Abstract This study used an age-cutoff regression discontinuity design to examine the impact of a well-resourced Early Reading First prekindergarten program designed to foster the language and literacy development of 4-year-old children from low-income homes. A special challenge for the application of the language-rich curriculum and professional development package implemented in this study was the presence of a large proportion of ELL children in essentially English-speaking classrooms. We, therefore, sought to determine whether the program was effective for improving English language and literacy outcomes for English-language learners as well as native English speakers. There were large and significant differences between treatment and control groups on literacy outcomes for all students. On the literacy tasks, ELL students in the treatment groups performed nearly as well or better than non-ELL students at the beginning of kindergarten, and reached national norms on standardized tests. There were also significant program impacts on some language outcomes for all students. ELL students who received the intervention significantly outperformed ELL students in the control groups on English receptive and expressive vocabulary. On the more complex oral comprehension skills, preschool did not have a significant impact for ELL students. Intervention effects on receptive vocabulary and oral comprehension for native speakers were found only for the third cohort and were not found for expressive vocabulary. These results provide evidence that, given material supports, coaching, professional development, and the use of a language and literacy-focused curriculum, prekindergarten classrooms can enable low-SES children from diverse language backgrounds to enter kindergarten with literacy skills at or near national norms and can significantly impact some language skills. While non-native speakers of English continued to score lower on language measures than their native-speaking peers, results show that 1 year of preschool can put all children on a positive trajectory for long-term success in school."

One hundred twenty children aged 58–69 months were assessed on letter-sound and letter-name knowledge, as well as on phonological awareness skills at the beginning, the middle and the end of kindergarten. The findings indicated that: (a) kindergarten children knew more letter-sounds than letter-names in almost every case across the assessment points; (b) letter-sound knowledge predicted letter-name knowledge slightly better than vice versa; (c) phonological awareness was associated directly with later letter-sound and letter-name knowledge, and (d) the bidirectional hypothesis between phonological awareness and letters knowledge was not confirmed."

We were interested in identifying factors that would be more accessible to families and school administrators as sources of potential change than broad and un-malleable reflections of socio-economic status. Consistent with current research, we found that maternal education had a broad impact on the reading readiness of children. Maternal education was linked to the amount of time children spent with non-literary media (television, computers, videos, video games). Re-running analyses using time with media as a covariate resulted in reduced differences in reading outcomes of children as a function of maternal education. Effects of maternal education were reduced by the end of the kindergarten year, indicating that literacy programming implemented by the school was successful in closing this academic gap."

As accumulated data suggests that these two modes of reading only partially overlap, our understanding of the natural mode of reading may still be limited. The present study was set out to explore the underlying skills of reading acquisition examined using silent measures of reading. To this end, children acquiring reading of the phonologically transparent vowelized Hebrew orthography were followed from kindergarten to the 2nd grade. The relations between a range of verbal and visual-spatial skills with measures of silent reading were tested. Phonological awareness, RAN and vocabulary explained a significant amount of variance in fluency in word recognition and in fluency in decoding of pseudo-homophones, while visual speed of processing of numeric symbols explained a notable amount of variance in fluency in word recognition only. Phonological awareness, morphological awareness and phonological working memory were the main skills explaining the variance in reading comprehension. The relations of these skills with the quality of oral reading have been widely established in the reading literature. Furthermore, a similar developmental picture was obtained in the relations between some of these skills and silent reading, as was found with oral reading. Therefore the role of these skills in reading may not be restricted to a certain mode of reading. Also consistent with findings on oral reading, the role of the visual non-orthographic skills in the measures of silent reading was insignificant to very small. Together these results imply that the processes underlying measures of silent reading are not substantially different from the ones underlying measures of oral reading, at least not at the early stages of reading acquisition of a transparent orthography."

Results from a correlational analysis of 73 4- and 5-year-olds revealed a significant association between VisD and letter identification abilities, which was not moderated by estimated nonverbal or verbal abilities or lexical access. Stronger VisD abilities also were positively associated with better phonemic awareness skills, presumably because of the association between letter knowledge and phonemic skills, or letter-sound correspondence. A pilot study explored the benefit of visual discrimination training of letter-like forms to letter learning for a subset of 28 children with below average lowercase letter identification abilities. Only letter-name training significantly impacted lowercase letter identification; visual discrimination training did not further enhance performance. Implications for theory and applications to interventions aimed at children at risk for reading delays are discussed."

Hillairet de Boisferon, Pascale Colé, Edouard Gentaz","Resume L’objectif de cette recherche etait d’etudier l’influence particuliere de la connaissance du nom des lettres dans l’acquisition de la lecture chez des enfants de cinq ans scolarises en grande section de maternelle. De nombreuses etudes ont souligne l’importance des connaissances metaphonologiques et orthographiques (connaissance des lettres et des associations graphophonologiques developpees au cours de l’apprentissage de la lecture). Nous nous sommes donc interesses aux liens existants entre ces differentes connaissances ainsi qu’aux liens qu’elles entretiennent avec le decodage au cours de l’annee scolaire. Pour ce faire, nous avons propose a 40 enfants, en decembre et en avril, des epreuves d’habiletes metaphonemiques (identification de phoneme en position initiale et finale dans les mots), de connaissance du son et du nom (denomination et identification) des lettres et une tâche de decodage de pseudomots. Pour la connaissance du nom des lettres, deux types de mesures ont ete proposes, une mesure de precision et une mesure de rapidite evaluant l’automatisation de l’acces a cette connaissance. Les nombres moyens de reponses correctes et les temps de reaction moyens recueillis pour chaque enfant, en debut et en fin d’annee, ont ete utilises pour differentes analyses correlationnelles. Les resultats revelent qu’en decembre, la connaissance du nom des lettres jouerait un role dans le developpement des habiletes metaphonemiques et dans la decouverte et l’acquisition des associations lettres-sons (evaluees avec une tâche de connaissance du son des lettres). La connaissance du nom des lettres pourrait donc influencer indirectement, via l’amelioration de ces competences, le niveau de decodage ulterieur des enfants. De plus, le lien direct entre la connaissance du nom des lettres et les capacites de decodage, deja observe en decembre, se confirme. Enfin, l’analyse des mesures de rapidite de l’utilisation de la connaissance du nom des lettres montre que les enfants qui denomment un nombre important de lettres sont aussi ceux qui les denomment le plus rapidement. Ce dernier resultat laisse supposer qu’un certain niveau de connaissance du nom des lettres doit etre atteint avant de pouvoir automatiser son utilisation. L’ensemble des resultats confirme l’importance, dans les premiers temps de l’apprentissage de la lecture, d’une bonne connaissance du nom des lettres. Nous suggerons egalement, pour une meilleure comprehension des mecanismes d’acquisition de la lecture et de ces composantes, la prise en compte d’indices refletant l’automatisation de l’utilisation de la connaissance du nom des lettres."

Snowling, Alison Gallagher, Uta Frith","The development of 56 children at family risk of dyslexia was followed from the age of 3 years, 9 months to 8 years. In the high-risk group, 66% had reading disabilities at age 8 years compared with 13% in a control group from similar, middle-class backgrounds. However, the family risk of dyslexia was continuous, and high-risk children who did not fulfil criteria for reading impairment at 8 years performed as poorly at age 6 as did high-risk impaired children on tests of grapheme–phoneme knowledge. The findings are interpreted within an interactive model of reading development in which problems in establishing a phonological pathway in dyslexic families may be compensated early by children who have strong language skills."

present study sought to identify cognitive reading-related skills (i.e. visual
attention, rapid automatized naming and working memory) that might distinguish
dyslexic Arabic children from skilled ones in 4th and 5th grades, and to examine the potential contribution of these factors to word
reading and reading comprehension. Two experiments were conducted for this
purpose. In Experiment 1, normal readers (N = 108) and dyslexics (23) were
given a set of literacy tasks, visual attention, and rapid automatized naming.
The results indicated that dyslexic children exhibited lower reading-related
skills than controls. Visual attention and phonological processing were able to
predict word reading. Experiment 2 was carried out on 36 dyslexic children
compared to chronological-age controls. This experiment was designed to assess
the relation between phonological awareness and working memory with word recognition
and reading comprehension. Results showed significant differences between
groups in literacy scores. In addition, inter-correlations indicated a strong
relation between word recognition and reading comprehension on one hand and
phonological awareness and verbal working memory on the other. Regression
analyses showed that rapid naming, visual attention, and verbal working memory
were significantly associated with literacy. The findings underscored the
importance of cognitive skills in the acquisition of Arabic literacy and
emphasized persistent difficulties in dyslexic children from multiple causes."

Our strategy involved establishing selection measures and criteria by calibrating indicators of RD on 1 cohort of children, testing the parameters on a new cohort, exploring the relative accuracy of predictors gathered over time, and testing the contribution of dynamic segmentation in which children received varying levels of prompts in performing the task.

Alexander, F Martin","Abstract During the school years, psychological test norms may be indexed by age or by grade. A number of studies have shown that using age-based norms appears to produce biases associated with grade assignment. Cahan and Cohen [Child Dev. 60 (1989) 1239–1249] showed that the effect of one grade was over twice the effect of 1 year of age for most verbal cognitive ability subtests in Grades 4–6. A higher ratio might be expected for more curriculum-related areas such as reading tests. Analysis of a representative sample of 4257 Grade 1 and 2 children in Tasmanian government schools (which use relatively strict age assignment to grades) for three subtests of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test—Revised (WRMTR): Word Identification, Word Attack, and Passage Comprehension, showed that the grade effect is about twice the age effect. This data shows that using age-based norms instead of grade-based norms for reading and other verbal ability tests may produce bias in the early school years. Psychologists should thus be primarily concerned with children's educational history, as once children have entered school other developmental factors indexed by age have less influence on children's verbal performance."

Smith-Chant, Karen V Colton","Abstract Children's emergent literacy has received considerable attention in the last decade. The modal view of emergent literacy is that it encompasses all aspects of children's oral and written language skills. The present article proposes an alternative view whereby emergent literacy is a separate construct from oral language and metalinguistic skills. It is also proposed that emergent literacy is composed of two distinct components; children's conceptual knowledge (e.g., knowledge of the functions of print) and children's early procedural knowledge of writing and reading (e.g., invented spelling). Evidence is presented that supports this differentiated view of language and emergent literacy by showing that distinct patterns of relations exist among emergent literacy, oral language, and metalinguistic skills. It is concluded that separating the constructs of language and emergent literacy is an interesting alternative to current conceptions of emergent literacy. In time, such theoretical fine tuning will serve as better guides for policy and practice."

The importance of individual differences in phonological ability for Subsequent reading acquisition changed over time. At first, the effects of phonological abilities increased, but after Grade 1, these effects disappeared. Phonological awareness and rapid naming had independent and specific influences on reading achievement. Verbal working memory was associated with both reading and arithmetic acquisition. The results tend to support an interactive view of the relation between development of phonological abilities and learning to read."

Forty-two kindergarten and 42 first-grade children (14 children each in the experimental groups or control group) received training twice a week for 10 weeks. The results of this training study supported the growing evidence that phonemic awareness is causally related to reading achievement at the beginning stages of reading development. Furthermore, although a significant improvement in reading achievement was observed for both experimental groups in kindergarten and first-grade children, the degree of improvement in reading ability of the first-grade children depended strongly upon the type of instruction received. That is, the children who reflected upon and discussed the value, application, and utility of phonemic awareness for the activity of reading at an explicit level performed significantly better on a transfer measure of reading achievement than the skill and drill experimental group. The implications of a metalevel or metacognitive form of instruction are discussed."

Mann,"The results of many studies suggest that early reading problems are associated with deficiencies in certain spoken language skills. Children who encounter reading difficulty tend to be deficient in the perception of spoken words, the ability to retain linguistic material in temporary memory, and the ability to comprehend certain spoken sentences, as well as in their awareness about the phonological structure of spoken words. This paper summarizes these findings and provides an explanation in terms of the requirements of skilled reading. It further reviews the results of two longitudinal studies which show that inferior performance in kindergarten tests of language skills may presage future reading problems in the first grade. Based on these studies, procedures are suggested for kindergarten screening and for some ways of aiding children who, by virtue of inferior performance on the screening tests, might be considered at risk for early reading difficulties."

Share,"Abstract Two experiments tested the common assumption that knowing the letter names helps children learn basic letter-sound (grapheme–phoneme) relation because most names contain the relevant sounds. In Experiment 1 ( n =45), children in an experimental group learned English letter names for letter-like symbols. Some of these names contained the corresponding letter sounds, whereas others did not. Following training, children were taught the sounds of these same “letters.” Control children learned the same six letters, but with meaningful real-word labels unrelated to the sounds learned in the criterion letter-sound phase. Differences between children in the experimental and control groups indicated that letter-name knowledge had a significant impact on letter-sound learning. Furthermore, letters with names containing the relevant sound facilitated letter-sound learning, but not letters with unrelated names. The benefit of letter-name knowledge was found to depend, in part, on skill at isolating phonemes in spoken syllables. A second experiment ( n =20) replicated the name-to-sound facilitation effect with a new sample of kindergarteners who participated in a fully within-subject design in which all children learned meaningless pseudoword names for letters and with phoneme class equated across related and unrelated conditions."

Recent evidence indicates that phonological sensitivity and reading are reciprocally related. That is, phonological sensitivity facilitates the development of early reading and early reading facilitates the development of phonological sensitivity. Whereas evidence for this reciprocal relation has come from studies with school-age children, this study examined the relation between phonological sensitivity and letter knowledge in 97 middle-income 4- and 5-year-old children in a 1-year longitudinal study. Multiple regression analyses revealed that phonological sensitivity predicted growth in letter knowledge, and letter knowledge predicted growth in phonological sensitivity when controlling for children's age and oral language abilities. These results indicate that the reciprocal relation between reading and phonological sensitivity is present relatively early in the development of literacy skills, prior to the onset of formal reading instruction."

In this study, we investigated critical factors in the development of letter-writing skills using exploratory item response models to simultaneously account for variance in responses due to differences between students and between letters. Letter-writing skills were assessed in 415 preschool children aged 3 to 5 years. At the student level, we examined the contribution of letter-name knowledge, letter-sound knowledge, and phonological awareness to letter-writing skills. At the letter level, we examined seven intrinsic and extrinsic factors in understanding how preschool children learn to write alphabet letters: first letter of name, letters in name, letter order, textual frequency, number of strokes, symmetry, and letter type. Results indicated that variation in letter-writing skills was accounted for more by differences between students rather than by differences between letters, with most of the variability accounted for by letter-name knowledge and age. Although significant, the contribution of letter-sound knowledge and phonological awareness was relatively small. Student-level mechanisms underlying the acquisition of letter-writing skills are similar to the mechanisms underlying the learning of letter sounds. However, letter characteristics, which appear to play a major role in the learning of letter names and letter sounds, did not appear to influence learning how to write letters in a substantial way. The exception was if the letter was in the child’s name."

The current study tries to address this scarcity by examining the effects of daily parent–child reading activities on the German vocabulary knowledge of children with (n = 531) and without migration background (n = 499) between the ages of three to five. Using propensity score matching (PSM), determinants of reading aloud daily to children are analyzed in the first step. Native parents are found to be more likely to read aloud daily to their children. Parents’ education, cultural capital and a high frequency of engaging parenting practices also predict the frequency of parent–child reading. Factors specific to immigrant families are the age of migration and the primary family language. The effect of reading aloud on the vocabulary skills of children is the focus of the second part of the analysis. Positive effects are found among children of immigrants and children of native-born parents. However, this positive effect is reduced over time for native children. Overall, reading aloud daily is most effective among children of immigrant families, using the language of the host country as the primary family language, and among parents with good receiving country language skills."

Less skilled readers were significantly less accurate than the skilled readers in a vowel identification task involving the lax and tense high vowels /i/ and /i/. The error pattern for vowel identification was similar across groups, with both groups making fewer errors when short and longer segments were alternated. The results imply that vowel phonemes are less securely represented in the perceptual system of less skilled readers than are consonant phonemes.

Maternal verbal scaffolding indirectly influenced both decoding and comprehension, through its support of children's language abilities at 3 and 4 years of age. Additionally, there was a trend for a direct effect of 4 year child language on reading comprehension at 10 years. As maternal verbal scaffolding was assessed during every day routines, this suggests that rich language input in the broad social context of the home promotes language and, in turn, later reading skills. Given that maternal verbal scaffolding can be enhanced through interventions, these results have important educational implications."

This article discusses factors that have been shown to contribute to children's success in early reading, namely-phonological awareness, letter-word identification, oral language, and the home literacy environment. Preliminary evidence suggests that bilingual children from low-income backgrounds initially perform poorly on phonological awareness and letter identification tasks, but appear to acquire these abilities quickly in kindergarten once these abilities are emphasized in early reading instruction. In addition, the findings show that bilingual preschoolers' receptive language abilities in English and Spanish positively impact their early letter-word identification abilities at the end of kindergarten.

The epidemiology of preschool speech sound disorder is poorly understood. Our aims were to determine: the prevalence of idiopathic speech sound disorder; the comorbidity of speech sound disorder with language and pre-literacy difficulties; and the factors contributing to speech outcome at 4 years.

Method
One thousand four hundred and ninety-four participants from an Australian longitudinal cohort completed speech, language, and pre-literacy assessments at 4 years. Prevalence of speech sound disorder (SSD) was defined by standard score performance of ≤79 on a speech assessment. Logistic regression examined predictors of SSD within four domains: child and family; parent-reported speech; cognitive-linguistic; and parent-reported motor skills.

Results
At 4 years the prevalence of speech disorder in an Australian cohort was 3.4%. Comorbidity with SSD was 40.8% for language disorder and 20.8% for poor pre-literacy skills. Sex, maternal vocabulary, socio-economic status, and family history of speech and language difficulties predicted SSD, as did 2-year speech, language, and motor skills. Together these variables provided good discrimination of SSD (area under the curve=0.78).

Interpretation
This is the first epidemiological study to demonstrate prevalence of SSD at 4 years of age that was consistent with previous clinical studies. Early detection of SSD at 4 years should focus on family variables and speech, language, and motor skills measured at 2 years."

Several decontextualized language skills were assessed with a picture description task and a word definition task. Prereading skills were found to be highly intercorrelated and to relate to the ability to provide decontextualized definitions for words. Oral language measures of decontextualized skill correlated within task, but not across tasks. Social class differences were found for the prereading measures and for those oral language measures that correlated with the prereading measures. Social class differences were not found on measures of ability to provide communicatively adequate definitions or for receptive vocabulary."

In particular we related the arithmetic achievement of children with CI to nonverbal IQ, reading skills and hearing variables. Methods 23 children with CI (onset of hearing loss in the first 24 months, cochlear implantation in the first 60 months of life, atleast 3 years of hearing experience with the first CI) and 23 normal hearing peers matched by age, gender, and social background participated in this case control study. All attended grades two to four in primary schools. To assess their arithmetic achievement, all children completed the “Arithmetic Operations” part of the “Heidelberger Rechentest” (HRT), a German arithmetic test. To assess reading skills and nonverbal intelligence as potential predictors of arithmetic achievement, all children completed the “Salzburger Lesetest” (SLS), a German reading screening, and the Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFIT), a nonverbal intelligence test. Results Children with CI did not differ significantly from hearing children in their arithmetic achievement. Correlation and regression analyses revealed that in children with CI, arithmetic achievement was significantly (positively) related to reading skills, but not to nonverbal IQ. Reading skills and nonverbal IQ were not related to each other. In normal hearing children, arithmetic achievement was significantly (positively) related to nonverbal IQ, but not to reading skills. Reading skills and nonverbal IQ were positively correlated. Hearing variables were not related to arithmetic achievement. Conclusions Children with CI do not show lower performance in non-verbal arithmetic tasks, compared to normal hearing peers."

Background: According to the phonologic core deficit hypothesis, dyslexia may stem from impairment of the representation and manipulation of phonemes and may be closely associated with oral language deficits. However, deficits in tasks not requiring fine-grained phonologic representations, such as RAN, have also been described in dyslexic children. Methods: Thirty-seven children were selected on the basis of a reading deficit and were assigned to 2 groups according to whether or not they had a history of early LD as determined retrospectively by parental report. A battery of reading and writing, verbal working memory, metaphonologic, RAN, and visual search tests were administered. Results: RAN deficits were shared by most dyslexics (with and without a history of LD), whereas phonologic deficits were mainly associated with a previous LD. This last condition did not result in a more profound impairment of reading and writing decoding skills. Conclusion: In a shallow orthography such as Italian, RAN, not phonologic deficits, may represent the main cognitive marker of developmental dyslexia."

Because of the unique features of Chinese characters, it may be that predictors of literacy acquisition differ developmentally for reading and writing. In this study, we examined longitudinal predictors of reading and writing for 73 Chinese kindergarteners when they were 5; 2 (year; month) (range = 4; 9–6; 2). Word reading and writing were not significantly correlated at time 1 (T1), but were significantly associated with one another one year later (T2). At T1, the unique correlates of word reading were semantic radical awareness, rapid automatized naming, and vocabulary, whereas the only unique correlate of word writing was visual-orthographic copying skill. Semantic radical awareness at T1 uniquely predicted both word reading and word writing at T2, with age, nonverbal reasoning, and T1 performance statistically controlled. These results suggest that reading and writing differ in unique correlates in the beginning but change rapidly with development. Findings also shed light on the importance of semantic radical awareness in early literacy development in Chinese."

Kindergarten students ( N = 83) in a regular English program were administered English early literacy measures. Three years later, once students entered the FI, 56 students from the original cohort were reassessed using French literacy measures. This allowed for an examination of the long-term connections between first language (L1) early literacy indicators and L2 reading outcomes. Regression analysis revealed that L1 early literacy skills relating to aspects of phonological awareness and, more importantly, alphabetic knowledge were significant predictors of L2 reading even when school-based L2 learning was delayed several years. With respect to the French literacy indicators, knowledge of the alphabet and related measures were again significant predictors of L2 reading performance. The predictive effects of French indicators were significant even in the first few months of FI. These results provide additional information about the predictive effects of within- and cross-language early literacy indicators and the extent to which they can be used to identify students who may be at risk for reading difficulties in their L2.

Trois ans plus tard, apres leur entree dans le PIF, on s’est servi des mesures de litteratie du francais pour reevaluer 56 de ces eleves. On a pu ainsi examiner les rapports a long terme entre les indicateurs de litteratie precoce en langue premiere (L1) et les performances de lecture en L2. L’analyse de la regression revele que les capacites de lecture et d’ecriture precoces en langue premiere associees a la sensibilisation phonologique et, surtout, a la connaissance de l’alphabet sont des variables explicatives revelatrices des competences de lecture en L2, meme quand l’apprentissage scolaire de la L2 est repousse de plusieurs annees.

In a large-scale project, children with serious reading problems received targeted intervention to address critical early literacy skills. The assistance combined focused practice and frequent monitoring to provide instruction needed to improve reading skills. Participating students achieved significant gains in reading performance compared to a control group not receiving intervention. The outcomes of the study relate to continuing efforts to reduce the very large numbers of children failing to achieve early literacy skills in U.S. schools."

Functional imaging studies have shown that pause and articulation times in continuous speech are normally associated with different brain regions, but knowledge about such association in dementia is lacking. We therefore tested the hypothesis that perfusion deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not only associated with slower processing, but also with these speech measures. Using regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements during the performance of a continuous colour and form-naming task, we found that naming speed was substantially slower in AD patients than in controls. This slower naming was exclusively determined by an increase in mean pause time, and only to a limited extent by articulation time. The increased pause time was uniquely associated with temporo-parietal rCBF reductions of the patients, while articulation was not. By contrast, the rCBF of healthy elderly control subjects was consistently accompanied by substantially shorter articulation and pause times, although the naming measures were not statistically associated with rCBF. These findings suggest that pause time (in contrast to articulation time) may serve as a sensitive measure in the assessment of information processing speed deficits in dementia, by virtue of its close association with brain pathology.

McClelland","Abstract : A parallel distributed processing model of visual word recognition and pronunciation and of the acquisition of these skills is described. The model consists of a set of orthographic units used to code letter strings, a set of hidden units, and a set of phonemic units. Weights on connections between units were modified during a training phase using the back-propagation learning algorithm. The model takes letter strings as input and yields two types of output: a pattern of activation across the phonemic units, and a recreation of the input spelling pattern across the orthographic units. The model was trained on a corpus of 2897 English words that included most of the uninflected monosyllabic words in the language. The model provides detailed accounts of performance on two tasks, naming aloud and lexical decision, and simulates many aspects of human performance, including (a) differences between words in terms of processing difficulty; (b) pronunciation of novel items; (c) differences between readers in terms of word recognition skill; (d) transitions from beginning to skilled reading; and (e) differences in performance on the two tasks. The model's behavior early in the learning phase corresponds to that of children acquiring word recognition skills. Training with a smaller number of hidden units produces output characteristic of many poor readers. (kr)"

Results show that Italian children with SLI aged 6 to 9;11 years fail to produce DO clitics and tend to produce a lexical noun introduced by a determiner (full DP) in the argument postverbal position instead of the pronoun; the production of reflexive clitics is preserved in the same population. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses and computation of likelihood ratios show that the failure to produce DO clitics is a persistent good clinical marker of SLI in Italian. We argue that DO clitic production requires complex morphosyntactic operations that are hardly achieved by children with SLI; our findings are compatible with theories considering...

The simplest contrasts consist of comparisons of two samples (e.g., based on the independent t statistic). Useful effect-size indices in this situation are members of the g family (e.g., Hedges's g and Cohen's d) and the Pearson r. We review expressions for calculating these measures and for transforming them back and forth, and describe how to adjust formulas for obtaining g or d from t, or r from g, when the sample sizes are unequal. The real-life implications of d or g calculated from t become problematic when there are more than two groups, but the correlational approach is adaptable and interpretable, although more complex than in the case of two groups. We describe a family of four conceptually related correlation indices: the alerting correlation, the contrast correlation, the effect-size correlation, and the BESD (binomial effect-size display) correlation...."

The authors used regression analyses to identify parsimonious models that explained variance in early reading. The main finding of the study was that semantic abilities (i.e., oral definitions and word retrieval), not phonological awareness, predicted 2nd-grade reading comprehension. As expected, phonological awareness skill in kindergarten predicted single-word reading at 1st and 2nd grades. The finding that semantic skills predicted passage comprehension suggests that the importance of different oral language skills to early reading..."

Three predictions drawn from the simple view were assessed in a longitudinal sample of English-Spanish bilingual children in first through fourth grade. The results supported each prediction: (a) The linear combination of decoding and listening comprehension made substantial contributions toward explaining variation in reading comprehension, but the estimates were significantly improved by inclusion of the product of the two components; (b) the correlations between decoding and listening comprehension tended to become negative as samples were successively restricted to less skilled readers; and (c) the pattern of linear relationships between listening and reading comprehension for increasing levels of decoding skill revealed constant intercept values of zero and positive slope values increasing in magnitude. These results support the view that skill in reading can be simply characterized as the product of skill in decoding and linguistic comprehension. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the simple view for the practice of reading instruction, the definition of reading disability, and the notion of literacy."

M. Bishop, Barbara Clarkson","Previous work has suggested that, because writing is a late-acquired and complex skill, it may be a particularly sensitive index of language difficulties in children. Evidence in support of this view was obtained in a study contrasting 161 normally-developing control children aged from 7.5 to 13 years with 75 twin children of the same age who either had specific speech-language impairments, or were co-twins of affected children. Written narratives were elicited from children using a sequence of five photographs depicting a simple story, and were analysed for grammatical complexity and accuracy, intelligibility, and semantic content. Only 42 of the twins could spell well enough to attempt the narrative task. Some co-twins of affected children had deficits in written language, despite normal performance on oral language tests. Most children with language impairments were poor at writing, with particularly marked deficits on a measure of spelling and punctuation. Children with language impairments made a relatively high proportion of phonologically inaccurate spelling errors when compared with younger children at a similar vocabulary level. Those who did poorly on a nonword repetition test were especially likely to have poor written language. However, four children with pure speech difficulties produced age-appropriate written narratives."

Creaghead","Abstract Purpose Language develops at variable rates in young children, yet markers for different developmental trajectories, have not been identified. Production of fricatives in words may be one marker because they are later developing sounds and contribute to syntactic production. We examined whether children who produced fricatives in words by 18 months had better vocabulary and grammar scores at 18, 24, and 30 months than children who did not. Method The expressive language skills of 37 toddlers who did and did not produce fricatives in words by 18 months of age were compared at 18, 24 and 30 months of age. Results Expressive vocabulary scores and the use of grammatical markers were significantly better for children who produced fricatives by 18 months than for those who did not. This effect was consistent across scores at 18, 24, and 30 months. The total number of consonants and total number of fricatives produced at 18 months did not significantly predict expressive vocabulary scores. Conclusions Because the children who produced fricatives by 18 months demonstrated better expressive language skills than their peers who did not produce fricatives by 18 months, the early production of fricatives by toddlers may be a marker of a faster expressive language developmental trajectory. Learning outcomes: Readers will: (1) describe the relationship between early phonological development and early expressive lexical development, (2) describe the role of perceptual and motor development in speech sound the acquisition, and (3) describe the potential relationship between the production of fricatives and expressive language development."

Torgesen,"The goal of many recent intervention studies has been to examine the conditions that must be in place for all children to acquire adequate reading skills. Although the ultimate goal of reading instruction is to help children acquire the skills necessary to comprehend text, an important subgoal for early reading instruction is to teach children to identify words accurately on the printed page. Five recent studies of methods to prevent reading difficulties were examined in light of the goal that every child should acquire adequate word reading skills during early elementary school. It was estimated that our best current methods, if applied broadly, would leave anywhere from 2% to 6% of children with inadequate word reading skills in the first and second grades. Several broad characteristics of these ""treatment resisters"" are identified, and the implications of these findings for future research are discussed."

To address this issue, we examined the degree of overlap among etiological influences of prereading skills in 1,252 twin pairs in kindergarten. Genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental factors were significant for all three literacy phenotypes. The majority of genetic and shared environmental influence on decoding was due to common factors that included print awareness and phonological awareness. Notably, only a single genetic factor contributed to all three literacy phenotypes, but there was additional shared environmental influence common to phonological awareness and decoding. Findings suggest commonalities in the etiology of prereading literacy skills that could inform work on the development of reading skill."

Sondergeld","Abstract In this study, we used Rasch model analyses to examine (1) the unidimensionality of the alphabet knowledge construct and (2) the relative difficulty of different alphabet knowledge tasks (uppercase letter recognition, names, and sounds, and lowercase letter names) within a sample of preschoolers ( n  = 335). Rasch analysis showed that the four components of alphabet knowledge did work together as a unidimensional construct, indicating all alphabet tasks administered were measuring the same underlying skill. With regard to difficulty of tasks, letter recognition was easier than letter naming, which in turn was easier than letter sounds, and uppercase letter names were easier than lowercase letter names. Most notably, most of the alphabet tasks overlapped, and the Rasch models for the single tasks were no more reliable than the combined measure. This suggests that these alphabetic tasks do not measure distinct skills but are instead indicators of a single ability. Consequently, we support the conceptualization of alphabet knowledge as a unitary construct, and suggest that those assessing and teaching alphabet knowledge in preschool use tests and methods that combine the various alphabetic tasks rather than separating them. These combined assessments will be more likely to capture the range of abilities within a preschool sample and avoid the floor and ceiling effects that have so often complicated early literacy research."

In addition children's attempts at rereading miscued words were coded as successful or not. Parents often provided a string of feedback clues and analyses revealed that the level of support parents provided shifted up or increased when their child was unsuccessful in rereading a word after feedback. With increasing level of parental support children's success in rereading misread words increased. Moreover, children with weaker word recognition skill were offered feedback at higher levels of support by their parents. These results demonstrate how parents and children co-construct the feedback that parents provide when listening to their children r..."

Bojczyk, Heather Rogers-Haverback, Hye K. Pae, Anna E. Davis, Rihana S. Mason","Children from different backgrounds have disparate access to cultural capital, which may influence their academic success. The purpose of this study was to examine the links between family background, home literacy experiences, and emergent literacy skills among preschoolers enrolled in Head Start programmes. The background characteristics studied included urbanicity, maternal education, ethnicity, and family size among 112 preschool children (59 rural and 53 urban, M age = 56.78 months). Findings showed that rural and urban preschoolers may have similar literacy abilities. However, when maternal education was controlled for, family background variables and components of the home literacy environment predicted emergent literacy skills differently for the two groups. Moreover, mother's active involvement and the child's own engagement in literacy seemed to play a salient role in early literacy development across groups."
707,2033026320,continuity and change in the home literacy environment as predictors of growth in vocabulary and reading,2014,10.1111/cdev.12222,Child Development,"Monique Sénéchal, Jo-Anne LeFevre","One hundred and ten English-speaking children schooled in French were followed from kindergarten to Grade 2 (Mage :T 1= 5;6, T2 = 6;4, T3 = 6;11, T4 = 7;11). The findings provided strong support for the Home Literacy Model (Senechal & LeFevre, 2002) because in this sample the home language was independent of the language of instruction. The informal literacy environment at home predicted growth in English receptive vocabulary from kindergarten to Grade 1, whereas parent reports of the formal literacy environment in kindergarten predicted growth in children’s English early literacy between kindergarten and Grade 1 and growth in English word reading during Grade 1. Furthermore, 76% of parents adjusted their formal literacy practices according to the reading performance of their child, in support of the presence of a responsive home literacy curriculum among middle-class parents. Young children enter Grade 1 with a variety of skills that facilitate their acquisition of reading. Individual differences in the quality of these skills are present early and remain relatively stable over time (e.g., Butler, Marsh, Sheppard, & Sheppard, 1985). Children who struggle with learning to read in Grade 1 often have difficulty in other school domains, and are less likely than their peers to complete high school or pursue education beyond high school (Alexander, Entwisle, & Horsey, 1997; Entwisle, Alexander, & Olson, 2005). Given the stability of the pathways toward efficient reading and academic success, it is essential to understand the development of these differences so that intervention can be done early (Hart & Petrill, 2009; Landry, Smith, Swank, & Guttentag, 2008). In this research, we examined the role of the home literacy environment in prediction of language and literacy development for young English-speaking children as they entered kindergarten, learned to read in Grade 1, and became more fluent readers in Grade 2. The novelty of this research is that the children were schooled in French but spoke English at home, thus allowing for a test of the relation between English home literacy activities and the children’s progress in English literacy that was independent of schoolbased English language instruction."

It evaluated associations among oral and hand motor speeds and measures of speech (articulation and phonology) and language (receptive vocabulary, sentence comprehension, sentence imitation), in 11 children with moderate to severe SSD and 11 controls. Syllable durations from a syllable repetition task served as an estimate of maximal oral movement speed. In two imitation tasks, nonwords and clapped rhythms, unstressed vowel durations and quarter-note clap intervals served as estimates of oral and hand movement speed, respectively. Syllable durations were significantly correlated with vowel durations and hand clap intervals. Sentence imitation was correlated with all three timed movement measures. Clustering on syllable repetition durations produced three clusters that also differed in sentence imitation scores. Results are consistent with limited movement speeds across motor systems and SSD subtypes defined by motor speeds as a corollary of expressive language abilities."

We first outline the political context in the UK, which for the first time, makes the use of such tests viable. We then outline the research programs behind and the components of each test; reliability and validity are also discussed. Information is presented on the tests in use. We conclude that tests such as these have the potential to identify children as at risk before they fail, halting the cycle of emotional and motivational problems traditionally associated with dyslexia. Both tests are appropriate for use in the United States, and initial reactions from the education sector have been favorable."

In a group of 115 students (65 girls, 50 boys) acquiring the phonologically transparent German orthography, prediction measures (letter knowledge, phonological short-term memory, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, and nonverbal IQ) were assessed at the beginning of Grade 1; reading fluency and spelling were tested at the end of Grade 1 as well as in Grades 4 and 8. Reading accuracy was close to ceiling in all reading assessments, such that reading fluency was not heavily influenced by differences in reading accuracy. High stability was observed for word reading fluency development. Of the dysfluent readers in Grade 1, 70% were still poor readers in Grade 8. For spelling, children who at the end of Grade 1 still had problems translating spoken words into phonologically plausible letter sequences developed problems with orthographic spelling later on. The strongest specific predictors were rapid automatized naming for reading fluency and phonological awareness for spelling. Word recognition speed was a relevant and highly stable indicator of reading skills and the only indicator that discriminated reading skill levels in consistent orthographies. Its long-term development was more strongly influenced by early naming speed than by phonological awareness."

The main goal of the first study was to examine whether reading level at age 8 can be predicted on the basis of a skill very rarely examined in longitudinal studies: phonemic discrimination. Two groups of French-speaking children were selected based on their phonemic discrimination skills at age 5: a group with low skills and a group with average to high skills in that domain. These two groups were respectively classified as being ""at-risk"" and ""not-at-risk"" for reading acquisition, and were matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ and vocabulary. Phonemic discrimination was found to be an important predictor of reading acquisition. Indeed, the two groups defined at age 5 based on their phonemic discrimination skills obtained significantly different reading scores at age 8, and the proportion of children with reading disabilities was higher in the at-risk group than in the not-at-risk group. The main goal of the second study was to assess whether reading skills at age 8 could be predicted by the ""classical"" predictors of reading acquisition assessed at age 5: pre-reading level, letter-name knowledge, phonemic segmentation and phonological short-term-memory (STM). A high proportion of the variance in reading at age 8 (52.8%) was predicted by these predictors, with four contributing unique and significant portions of that variance: pre-reading level, letter-name knowledge for vowels (not for consonants), phonemic segmentation (not syllabic segmentation) and phonological STM."

This study investigates the PA skills of preschoolers with SSD using a regression model to evaluate the degree to which PA can be concurrently predicted by types of speech sound errors. Method—Preschoolers with SSD (n=43) participated in PA and speech sound production assessment. Errors from a 125-item picture naming task were coded in two ways: (1) considering all consonant errors equally (Percent Consonants Correct, PCC), and (2) using a three-category system that captures component features of sound errors: typical sound changes, atypical sound changes, and distortions. PA tasks included rhyme matching, onset matching, onset segmentation and matching, and blending. Results—Variance in a PA composite score could be predicted partly by vocabulary and age (33%). Atypical sound changes accounted for an additional 6% of variance in PA, but distortions and typical errors did not account for significant variance. When the same consonant errors were analyzed using PCC, speech errors did not predict significant variance in PA. Conclusions—Poorer PA is associated with lower receptive vocabularies and more atypical sound errors. Results are interpreted in the context of the accuracy of phonological representations."

The relationships between a range of cognitive and linguistic skills (letter knowledge, phoneme manipulation, visual-verbal paired-associate learning, rapid automatized naming (RAN), short-term memory, and verbal and nonverbal ability) were investigated and related to later measures of word recognition in reading. Letter knowledge, phoneme manipulation, and RAN were independent longitudinal predictors of early reading (word recognition) skills in the regular Norwegian orthography. Early reading skills initially appeared well described as a unitary construct that then showed rapid differentiation into correlated subskills (word decoding, orthographic choice, text reading, and nonword reading) that showed very high levels of longitudinal stability. The results are related to current ideas about the cognitive foundations of early reading skills."

Although each of these variables has been examined in the context of one or two of the other variables, this study examines all four factors together to assess their unique contribution to reading. A sample of children in Grades 4, 6, and 8 (ages 10, 12, and 14 years) completed a battery of tests that included at least one measure of each of the four variables and two measures of reading accuracy. Phonological awareness, orthographic knowledge, and morphological awareness each contributed uniquely to real word and pseudoword reading beyond the other variables, whereas naming speed did not survive these stringent controls. The results support the sustained importance of these three skills in reading by older readers."

Parents provided narrative responses to open-ended questions about how they would handle common discipline challenges with children and rated their likelihood of using physical punishment. Parents also reported the number of books they read with their children each week and completed a checklist assessing their familiarity with the titles and authors of children’s books. Children’s emergent literacy skills were assessed with individually administered tests. Analyses of covariance indicated that shared book reading was reliably associated with children’s language comprehension skills only among parents whose responses to discipline scenarios included relatively high levels of nondirective reasoning. Parents who expressed a willingness to consider physical punishment had children with lower language comprehension skills regardless of the quantity of shared book reading. These effects were reliable after taking into account the effects of parental education and children’s nonverbal reasoning skills."

The review included both extreme group studies and correlational studies with unselected samples (235 studies were included, and 995 effect sizes were calculated). Results from extreme group comparisons indicated that children with dyslexia show a large deficit on phonemic awareness in relation to typically developing children of the same age (pooled effect size estimate: 1.37) and children matched on reading level (pooled effect size estimate: 0.57). There were significantly smaller group deficits on both rime awareness and verbal short-term memory (pooled effect size estimates: rime skills in relation to age-matched controls, 0.93, and reading-level controls, 0.37; verbal short-term memory skills in relation to age-matched controls, 0.71, and reading-level controls, 0.09). Analyses of studies of unselected samples showed that phonemic awareness was the strongest correlate of individual differences in word reading ability and that this effect remained reliable after controlling for variations in both verbal short-term memory and rime awareness. These findings support the pivotal role of phonemic awareness as a predictor of individual differences in reading development. We discuss whether such a relationship is a causal one and the implications of research in this area for current approaches to the teaching of reading and interventions for children with reading difficulties."

The pattern of ABRM and ID scores suggests that a subset of children with concomitant oral language and reading impairments has poor ABRM thresholds, and that a subgroup of children with an SLI or SRD has poorer ID thresholds than controls. The latter result warns against using rapid auditory processing tasks that do not actively control for auditory discrimination ability. Further, some unusually poor ABRM scores and ID scores question the validity of extreme scores produced by children on psychophysical tasks. Finally, the poor oral language scores of many of the children who had impaired reading highlight the need to test the oral language skills of SRD samples to ascertain how homogeneous and specifically disabled they really are."

Following a longitudinal design, the children's decoding abilities for (1) regular CVC words, (2) complex monosyllabic words with consonant clusters in prevocalic and postvocalic position, and (3) polysyllabic words were assessed on two occasions during every grade. The results showed substantial growth across grade for all of the word decoding measures. Growth curve analyses showed a quadratic rather than a linear growth curve to optimally model the children's word decoding development. Small but significant effects of gender and linguistic diversity were observed: Girls generally did better than boys — mainly on the regular CVC word patterns. And children learning to read in Dutch as a first language generally did better than children learning to read Dutch as a second language — mainly on polysyllabic words. From a structural point of view, the development of word decoding in the different subgroups turned out to be highly comparable. Irrespective of gender and linguistic diversity, the three measures of word decoding strongly intercorrelated but also showed some unique variance. Moreover, a high degree of autoregression applied to the children's word decoding development over the school grades."

The present study expands previous studies by examining how home literacy practices are related to growth trajectories of emergent literacy skills (i.e., vocabulary, letter-name knowledge, and phonological awareness) and conventional literacy skills (i.e., word reading, pseudoword reading, and spelling), and by using data from Korean children and families (N = 192). The study revealed two dimensions of home literacy practices, home reading and parent teaching. Frequent reading at home was positively associated with children’s emergent literacy skills as well as conventional literacy skills in Korean. However, children whose parents reported more frequent teaching tended to have low scores in their phonological awareness, vocabulary, word reading and pseudoword reading after accounting for home reading. These results suggest a bidirectional relationship between home literacy practices, parent teaching in particular, and children’s literacy skills such that parents adjust their teaching in response to their child’s literacy acquisition. Furthermore, cultural variation in views on parent teaching may explain these results."

Results suggest that prosody abilities have different developmental trajectories and that prosody explains unique variance in reading beyond that explained by other factors. There was some evidence that the contribution of each prosody skill occurred at different phases in reading development. Nonlinguistic rhythm, lexical-stress sensitivity, and metrical-stress sensitivity assessed at the end of kindergarten, the start of Grade 1, and the end of Grade 1, respectively, predicted reading performance 6 months later.

Miller, Robert Kail, Laurence B. Leonard, J. Bruce Tomblin","The aim of the present study was to investigate the speed with which children with specific language impairment (SLI) respond on a range of tasks. Seventy-seven third-grade children participated in 10 different tasks (involving a total of 41 conditions), including nonlinguistic and linguistic activities. Mean response times (RTs) of children with SLI (n = 29) increased as a function of mean RTs of children with normal language (NLD, n = 29) under each of three different regression models; children with SLI responded more slowly across all task conditions, and also when linguistic and nonlinguistic tasks were analyzed separately. Children with nonspecific language impairment (NLI) were also included (n = 19). The results were similar to those for children with SLI, but the degree of slowing was greater. The results of the group analyses support the hypothesis that speed of processing in children with SLI is generally slower than that of children with normal language. However, some children with SLI do not appear to show deficits of this type."

Cutting, Kirby Deater-Deckard, Christopher Schatschneider, Stephen A. Petrill","The development of reading skills in typical students is commonly described as a rapid growth across early grades of active reading education, with a slowing down of growth as active instruction tapers. This study examined the extent to which genetics and environments influence these growth rates. Participants were 371 twin pairs, aged approximately 6 through 12, from the Western Reserve Reading Project. Development of word-level reading, reading comprehension, and rapid naming was examined using genetically sensitive latent quadratic growth curve modeling. Results confirmed the developmental trajectory described in the phenotypic literature. Furthermore, the same shared environmental influences were related to early reading skills and subsequent growth, but genetic influences on these factors were unique."

Snowling","The development of spelling skills was investigated at four points over the first 3 years of schooling in 153 British children. In order to uncover the developmental relationship between spelling and reading ability and to identify the component skills of spelling, children were assessed with a large battery of tests, including reading, phoneme awareness, letter-sound and letter-name knowledge, memory, and verbal and nonverbal IQ. Spelling productions were assessed both for phonological plausibility and for conventional accuracy. A path analysis revealed that phoneme segmentation and letter-sound knowledge were the precursor skills of early phonological spelling ability; in turn phonological spelling combined with reading to promote conventional spelling skill. Although initial phonological spelling ability predicted later reading, early reading ability did not influence later phonological spelling ability. These results indicate that skilled spelling requires a foundation in phonological transcoding ability which in turn enables the formation of orthographic representations. Our data also suggest that the increasingly complex and specific orthographic patterns demonstrated in children's spelling are learned through experience and instruction in both reading and spelling."

Interestingly, children with developmental dyslexia - a learning disability that affects reading acquisition despite normal intelligence and adequate education - have a poor rhythmic perception. It has been suggested that an accurate perception of rhythmical/metrical structure, that requires accurate perception of rise time, may be critical for phonological development and subsequent literacy. This hypothesis is mostly based on results showing a high degree of correlation between phonological awareness and metrical skills, using a very specific metrical task. We present new findings from the analysis of a sample of 48 children with a diagnosis of dyslexia, without comorbidities. These children were assessed with neuropsychological tests, as well as specifically-devised psychoacoustic and musical tasks mostly testing temporal abilities. Associations were tested by multivariate analyses including data mining strategies, correlations and most importantly logistic regressions to understand to what extent the different auditory and musical skills can be a robust predictor of reading and phonological skills. Results show a strong link between several temporal skills and phonological and reading abilities. These findings are discussed in the framework of the neuroscience literature comparing music and language processing, with a particular interest in the links between rhythm processing in music and language."

Lee Swanson","Abstract This article synthesizes literature that compares the academic, cognitive, and behavioral performance of children with and without reading disabilities (RD). Forty-eight studies met the criteria for the meta-analysis, yielding 735 effect sizes (ESs) with an overall weighted ES of 0.98. Small to high ESs in favor of children without RD emerged on measures of cognition (rapid naming [ES = 0.89], phonological awareness [ES = 1.00], verbal working memory [ES = 0.79], short-term memory [ES = 0.56], visual–spatial memory [ES = 0.48], and executive processing [ES = 0.67]), academic achievement (pseudoword reading [ES = 1.85], math [ES = 1.20], vocabulary [ES = 0.83], spelling [ES = 1.25], and writing [ES = 1.20]), and behavior skills (ES = 0.80). Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that specific cognitive process measures (verbal working memory, visual–spatial memory, executive processing, and short-term memory) and intelligence measures (general and verbal intelligence) significantly moderated overall group effect size differences. Overall, the results supported the assumption that cognitive deficits in children with RD are persistent."

Here we propose that orthographic depth is a conglomerate of two separate constructs: the complexity of print-to-speech correspondences and the unpredictability of the derivation of the pronunciations of words on the basis of their orthography. We show that on a linguistic level, these two concepts can be dissociated. Furthermore, we make different predictions about how the two concepts would affect skilled reading and reading acquisition. We argue that refining the definition of orthographic depth opens up new research questions. Addressing these can provide insights into the specific mechanisms by which language-level orthographic properties affect cognitive processes underlying reading."

Questionnaires from 378 5-year-olds` mothers in Seoul and Kyunggi province were analysed. The findings from the validated structural equation model constructed with these variables were as follows. First, the home literacy environment, the mother`s literacy beliefs and the mother`s general parenting efficacy affected the quantity, and the quality of interaction whilst reading books with preschoolers. Second, the mother`s efficacy in education and communication had a direct impact on the quantity of the interaction during reading books through the mediation of the home literacy environment, and had an indirect effect on the quality of the interaction whilst reading books, respectively. Third, the mother`s efficacy in communication directly accounted for the quality of the interaction which occurs whilst reading books with children."

In order of importance as rated by parents the goals were: Learning to Read, Enjoyment and Bonding, Learning from Books, and Soothing the Child. Maternal education, number of ABC books owned, and ABC book reading frequency were related to parents’ goals. When viewing ABC pages, parents rated pages with little text, simple illustrations, and letter sound-word consistency as more appropriate for fulfilling purposes related to learning to decode than pages with a lot of text, complex illustrations, and letter sound-word violations. These perceptions are congruent with previous research and experts’ advice. However, parents rated pages with more complex illustrations as more appropriate for enjoyment, potentially putting books with complex illustrations at cross purposes with the previous goals."

Perfetti, Li Hai Tan, Wai Ting Siok","It is ironic that our recent report on the neural correlatesof Chinese dyslexia (Siok, Perfetti, Jin, & Tan, 2004) raisesa concern by Ziegler (2006) that this report could under-mine an agreed-upon conclusion favoring a phonologicaldeﬁcit as the cause of reading disability. Our past researchover 20 years in English (Perfetti, 1985) and Chinese (Per-fetti, Liu, & Tan, 2005; Pollatsek, Tan, & Rayner, 2000;Tan & Perfetti, 1998) has argued that phonological pro-cesses are intrinsic to word reading and universal acrosswriting systems, and we certainly have no reason to mini-mize the importance of these processes for understandingreading disability. We address Ziegler’s concern by makingtwo observations. (1) The Siok et al. evidence supporting arole for the left middle frontal gyrus (LMFG) instead ofthe left posterior temporoparietal regions found in alpha-betic research does not undermine the consensus on theuniversality of phonology. Instead this evidence shows thatthe implementation of phonology depends on language andwriting systems, a conclusion also reached through behav-ioral evidence (Perfetti et al., 2005). (2) The detailed neuralbasis of dyslexia remains an open question, rather thanaccepted wisdom.On the ﬁrst point, Siok et al. did not conclude that pho-nology plays no role in Chinese reading disability and Zie-gler’s critique recognizes this. Indeed, the evidence in favorof a phonological basis for dyslexia in alphabetic writinghas accumulated impressively over 20 years, from a timeat which the prevailing views emphasized visual problemsas the cause of dyslexia. This evidence comes from neuro-biological (Brunswick, McCrory, Price, Frith, & Frith,1999; Eden et al., 2004; Price & Mechelli, 2005; Richards,Aylward, & Berninger, 2006; Shaywitz et al., 1998; Templeet al., 2003), cognitive (Bruck, 1992; Schatschneider,Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, & Foorman, 2004; Stanovich& Siegel, 1994; Vellutino, Fletcher, Snowling, & Scanlon,2004), and genetic perspectives (Taipale et al., 2003). Themore biologically speciﬁc form of the phonological hypoth-esis is that dyslexia is universally associated with functionaldisruption of the left temporoparietal brain regions(Paulesu et al., 2001). It is this hypothesis that is falsiﬁedby Siok et al. (2004).To summarize brieﬂy, using homophone and lexicaldecision tasks, we found that reading diﬃculty in Chi-nese is associated not only with a weakness in mappingof a character’s orthography to pronunciation (as mea-sured by the homophone decision task), but also witha substandard connection between orthography andmeaning (as indexed by the lexical decision paradigm).Importantly, these two deﬁcits were characterized by dys-function of the left middle frontal gyrus. The left tempo-roparietal brain regions associated with disabled readingin English and other alphabets were not involved in thereading of Chinese children. Thus, either Chinese readingdisability does not have a phonological component orthe phonological component in Chinese does not involvethe left temporoparietal regions. Because the Siok et al.behavioral data showed weakness in phonological pro-cessing, the conclusion is that this weakness is associatedwith some other neural substrate. The left middle frontalgyrus, which was under activated in Chinese dyslexics, isa likely candidate.However, this is not the end of the story, but the begin-ning. The research goal becomes to understand the func-tion of the LMFG in reading. It is not obvious that theLMFG, whatever its more general role in cognitive func-"

Study 1 compared reading of the same characters in isolation and those in the context of known words for 63 Chinese third-year kindergarteners. Results showed that children performed significantly better on reading the same characters when embedded within words than when alone. Study 2 further examined the correlates of single-character reading and two-character word reading for 142 Chinese third-year kindergarteners. Despite a high correlation between character reading and word reading, unique correlates emerged. Orthographic awareness, rapid automatized naming, and Pinyin letter-name knowledge independently explained variance in both character and word reading; however, orthographic awareness explained unique variance in character reading even after statistically controlling for word reading. Whereas orthographic and Pinyin knowledge may be more strongly associated with character recognition, other skills may be more important for learning to read words. Character and word reading may constitute slightly different processes, with somewhat different educational implications for each."

Share,"In this critique of current reading research and practice, the author contends that the extreme ambiguity of English spelling-sound correspondence has confined reading science to an insular, Anglocentric research agenda addressing theoretical and applied issues with limited relevance for a universal science of reading. The unique problems posed by this ""outlier"" orthography, the author argues, have focused disproportionate attention on oral reading accuracy at the expense of silent reading, meaning access, and fluency, and have significantly distorted theorizing with regard to many issues-including phonological awareness, early reading instruction, the architecture of stage models of reading development, the definition and remediation of reading disability, and the role of lexical-semantic and supralexical information in word recognition. The dominant theoretical paradigm in contemporary (word) reading research-the Coltheart/Baron dual-route model (see, e.g., J. Baron, 1977; M. Coltheart, 1978) and, in large measure, its connectionist rivals-arose largely in response to English spelling-sound obtuseness. The model accounts for a range of English-language findings, but it is ill-equipped to serve the interests of a universal science of reading chiefly because it overlooks a fundamental unfamiliar-to-familiarl novice-to-expert dualism applicable to all words and readers in all orthographies."

Stanovich,A coherent conception of dyslexia has been difficult to arrive at because research findings have continually created logical paradoxes for the psychometric definition of reading disability. One such paradox is that cognitive research has undermined the assumption of specificity in the definition of dyslexia. The assumption of specificity is the underlying premise that the cognitive problems characteristic of the dyslexic child are reasonably specific to the reading task and do not implicate broader domains of cognitive functioning. This paper demonstrates how to develop hypotheses about the cognitive deficits of dyslexic children that do not undermine the assumption of specificity. Phonological awareness is explored as one candidate process.

The reader pointed to each word while reading to half of the children. After each book, children were asked to recognize elements of the illustrations and the specially formatted text elements from among a set of foils. Videotaped sessions were coded for the time children spent looking toward the pages with print versus illustrations. Analyses showed that the percentage of time looking at print was less than 2% in the no-pointing condition but increased with age. Pointing to the words increased print-looking time for all age groups and print target recognition for 4-year-olds. After controlling for receptive vocabulary, visual memory, and maturation associated with these scores, emergent orthography and letter-word identification predicted time looking at print and recognition of the print elements."

Taran, Corinna A. Ethington","Oral language is the foundation on which literacy initially builds. Between early developing oral language skills and fluent reading comprehension emerge several types of metalinguistic ability, including phonological and morphological awareness. In this study, a developmental sequence is proposed, beginning with receptive language followed by phonological awareness, morphological awareness, and a new metalinguistic task measuring oral morphophonological accuracy (MPA), followed by decoding and culminating in reading comprehension. MPA is a measure of accurate primary stress placement in the production of derived words with non-neutral, stress changing suffixes (e.g., -ity). A path analysis with data from 76 third graders was used to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of these variables. The developmental model was confirmed, and a metalinguistic continuum, with MPA emerging after both PA and MA, was supported. Decoding and receptive language were the best unique predictors of reading comprehension. Surprisingly, MPA was more important to decoding than was PA, whereas MA was only indirectly implicated in both decoding and reading comprehension."

Gerry Taylor, Lisa A. Freebairn, Amy J. Hansen, Barbara A. Lewis","Objective: Disorders of articulation or speech-sound disorders (SSD) are common in early childhood. Children with these disorders may be at risk for reading difficulties because they may have poor auditory, phonologic, and verbal memory skills. Methods: We sought to characterize the reading and writing readiness of preschool children with SSD and identify factors associated with preliteracy skills. Subjects were 125 children aged 3 to 6 years with moderate to severe SSD; 53% had comorbid language impairment (LI). Reading readiness was measured with the Test of Early Reading Ability-2 (TERA) and writing skills with the Test of Early Written Language-2 (TEWL), which assessed print concept knowledge. Linear regression was used to examine the association between SSD severity and TERA and TEWL scores and analysis of variance to examine the effect of comorbid LI. Performance on a battery of speech and language tests was reduced by way of factor analysis to composites for articulation, narrative, grammar, and word knowledge skills. Results: Early reading and writing scores were significantly lower for children with comorbid LI but were not related to SSD severity once language status was taken into account. Composites for grammar and word knowledge were related to performance on the TERA and TEWL, even after adjusting for Performance IQ. Below average language skills in preschool place a child at risk for deficits in preliteracy skills, which may have implications for the later development of reading disability. Conclusion: Preschool children with SSD and LI may benefit from instruction in preliteracy skills in addition to language therapy."

J. van der Lely","Background: Despite a large body of evidence regarding reliable indicators of language deficits in young children, there has not been a standardized, quick screen for language impairment. The Grammar and Phonology Screening (GAPS) test was therefore designed as a short, reliable assessment of young children’s language abilities. Aims: GAPS was designed to provide a quick screening test to assess whether pre- and early school entry children have the necessary grammar and prereading phonological skills needed for education and social development. This paper reports the theoretical background to the test, the pilot study and reliability, and the standardization. Methods: This 10-min test comprises 11 test sentences and eight test nonsense words for direct imitation and is designed to highlight significant markers of language impairment and reading difficulties. To standardize the GAPS, 668 children aged 3.4–6.6 were tested across the UK, taking into account population distribution and socio-economic status. The test was carried out by a range of health and education professionals as well as by students and carers using only simple, written instructions. Results: GAPS is effective in detecting a range of children in need of further indepth assessment or monitoring for language difficulties. The results concur"

Lombardino","Abstract A detailed evaluation of a child's strengths and weaknesses allows for a valid and reliable diagnosis of reading disability for the selection of optimal intervention practices. Using archival data from a clinic that specialized in the diagnosis of reading disabilities, we compared the performance of 60 children diagnosed with specific reading disability (SRD) and 31 children with language impairments and reading disability (LIRD) on measures of cognitive reasoning, verbal ability, phonological manipulation, rapid serial naming, and phonological memory. While the SRD and LIRD groups did not differ in their phonological processing, children with LIRD performed significantly below their peers with SRD on thinking ability and verbal ability measures. Rapid naming skills served as current predictors of text reading fluency and verbal ability skills served as concurrent predictors of reading comprehension in both groups. These findings highlight the need for reading diagnosticians to conduct comprehensive evaluations using a range of cognitive and language processes to ensure the most accurate and specific diagnoses of children with reading disabilities. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to (a) describe general characteristics of reading disabilities, (b) differentiate features of two learning disabilities, specific reading disability and language impairments and reading disability, and (c) identify key clinical issues and approaches for identification, diagnosis, and intervention of these two diagnostic profiles."

Metsala,"The role of vocabulary growth in the development of two reading-related phonological processes was examined. In Experiments 1 and 2, 4- and 5-year-olds and a sample of first graders performed better on phonological awareness tasks for word versus pseudoword stimuli, and for highly familiar versus less familiar words. Three- and 4-year-olds in Experiment 3 performed better for words with many versus few similarly sounding items in a listener's lexicon. Vocabulary was strongly associated with nonword repetition scores for 3- to 5-year olds. The shared variance of this association was accounted for by phonological awareness measures and did not appear to be due to phonological short-term memory, as previously argued. The author proposes that vocabulary growth, defined in terms of absolute size, word familiarity, and phonological similarity relations between word items, helps to explain individual differences in emerging phonological awareness and nonword repetition."

Ninety-four six- to seven-year-old Chinese children completed a norm-referenced test for oral language and for literacy, as well as cognitive tasks related to reading development. Based on results from the norm-referenced tests, 40 children fell in the typically-developing Control group, 10 children in the dyslexia-only (D) group, 19 in the SLI-only group and 25 children in the SLI-D group. Orthographic skills and lexical access and retrieval skills were found to be associated with dyslexia. Phonological memory and morphological awareness were associated with SLI. Phonological awareness was associated with both SLI and dyslexia.

Reading skill was measured in third grade with a group-administered achievement test (vocabulary and comprehension), and children were classified as severely disabled, poor, average, or superior readers. Of the 19 possible kindergarten predictors, only rapid naming of letters, general ability, and discrimination of beginning sounds within words significantly contributed to the prediction of reading outcome. With general ability removed from the analysis, rapid letter naming, beginning sound discrimination, and auditory conceptualization predicted reading outcome. These three measures were very accurate in predicting reading outcome for the extremely poor and superior readers. The false negative rate was low but the false positive rate was quite high.

Two groups of mothers participated: mothers with a low education and mothers with a high education. The children’s emergent literacy was measured. The mothers evaluated their own children and 40 teachers evaluated these same children in the same domains. The children of mothers with a high education received higher scores in their actual emergent literacy level than the children of mothers with a low education. Their mothers’ and teachers’ evaluations were also higher than those in the counter group. The teachers’ and mothers’ evaluations of the children’s levels were higher than the children’s actual levels across both groups.

Wagner","Rapid serial naming tasks are frequently used to explain variance in reading skill. However, the construct being measured by rapid naming is yet undetermined. The Phonological Processing theory suggests that rapid naming relates to reading because of similar demands of access to long-term stored phonological representations of visual stimuli. Some researchers have argued that isolated or discrete-trial naming is a more precise measure of lexical access than serial naming, thus it is likely that any shared variance between these two formats can be attributed to similar lexical access demands. The present study examined whether there remained any variance in reading ability that could be uniquely explained by the rapid naming task while controlling for isolated naming. Structural equation modeling was used to examine these relations within the context of the phonological processing model. Results indicated that serial naming uniquely predicted reading, and the relation was stronger with isolated naming controlled for, suggesting that isolated naming functioned as a suppressor variable in the relation of serial naming with reading."

The children's scores on phonological awareness tasks as 4 year olds significantly predicted their reading and spelling ages 6 years later. Qualitative analyses of their reading and spelling processes, conducted within the framework of dual-route models of reading and spelling, indicated that children with good early phonological awareness have well-developed lexical and sublexical reading and spelling procedures. However, they show larger regularity effects in word reading and spelling, are better at nonword reading and spelling, and make more phonologically based errors in both reading and spelling than children with poor early phonological awareness. Furthermore, early phonological awareness scores are significantly related to reading regular but not irregular words. The results are interpreted to suggest that early phonological skills relate more strongly to development of sublexical than lexical processing systems."

Moore, N Biggio, Joseph T. Devlin","This paper uses whole brain functional neuroimaging in neurologically normal participants to explore how reading aloud differs from object naming in terms of neuronal implementation. In the first experiment, we directly compared brain activation during reading aloud and object naming. This revealed greater activation for reading in bilateral premotor, left posterior superior temporal and precuneus regions. In a second experiment, we segregated the object-naming system into object recognition and speech production areas by factorially manipulating the presence or absence of objects (pictures of objects or their meaningless scrambled counterparts) with the presence or absence of speech production (vocal vs. finger press responses). This demonstrated that the areas associated with speech production (object naming and repetitively saying “OK” to meaningless scrambled pictures) corresponded exactly to the areas where responses were higher for reading aloud than object naming in Experiment 1.

Collectively the results suggest that, relative to object naming, reading increases the demands on shared speech production processes. At a cognitive level, enhanced activation for reading in speech production areas may reflect the multiple and competing phonological codes that are generated from the sublexical parts of written words. At a neuronal level, it may reflect differences in the speed with which different areas are activated and integrate with one another."

Material-methods: Thirty-three children with functional articulation disorder were enrolled in this study. They ranged in age from 6 to 10 years. A control group without articulation disorders was composed of 160 children with similar properties. In the first stage of this study, both groups were administered the Ross Information Processing Assessment Test-Primary. In this test, the scores obtained from eight subtests; namely immediate memory, recent memory, recall of general information, spatial orientation, temporal orientation, organization, problem solving and abstract reasoning, was calculated for both groups. The scores of the eight subtests are combined to form the four composites. These composites are memory quotient, orientation quotient, thinking and reasoning quotient and information processing quotient. Information processing quotient is the best and the most comprehensive estimate of a child's overall information processing ability. In the second stage of the study the articulation-disordered group was divided into two subgroups according the number of the mistakes, which was done at the level of the phoneme. The scores obtained from both subgroups were compared with the scores of the control group. Results: The overall statistical analysis of the scores revealed that; the study group had significantly lower scores than the control group from memory quotient, thinking and reasoning quotient and information processing quotient. When compared to control group, the subgroup who cannot pronounce one phoneme had similar scores from all four composites. Moreover, the children who cannot pronounce multiple phonemes had significantly lower scores from memory quotient, thinking and reasoning quotient and information processing quotient. The results obtained from this study seem to be suggesting that information processing skills of children with functional articulation disorder are significantly low as compared to normal children. Conclusions: These results are revealing that the information processing skills of children with functional articulation disorder should be investigated in a detailed manner. According to the results obtained from this investigation these children should be put on deficit oriented education programs in addition to articulation therapy."

Paulsen, Alia L. Yasen, Leila Mitsunaga, Helen J. Neville","Previous research indicates that at least some children with specific language impairment (SLI) show a reduced neural response when non-linguistic tones were presented at rapid rates. However, this past research has examined older children, and it is unclear whether such deficits emerge earlier in development. It is also unclear whether atypical refractory effects differ for linguistic versus non-linguistic stimuli or can be explained by deficits in selective auditory attention reported among children with SLI. In the present study, auditory refractory periods were compared in a group of 24 young children with SLI (age 3–8 years) and 24 matched control children. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded and compared to 100 ms linguistic and non-linguistic probe stimuli presented at inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 200, 500, or 1000 ms. These probes were superimposed on story narratives when attended and ignored, permitting an experimental manipulation of selective attention within the same paradigm. Across participants, clear refractory effects were observed with this paradigm, evidenced as a reduced amplitude response from 100 to 200 ms at shorter ISIs. Children with SLI showed reduced amplitude ERPs relative to the typically-developing group at only the shortest, 200 ms, ISI and this difference was over the left-hemisphere for linguistic probes and over the right-hemisphere for non-linguistic probes. None of these effects was influenced by the direction of selective attention. Taken together, these findings suggest that deficits in the neural representation of rapidly presented auditory stimuli may be one risk factor for atypical language development."

In Study 2, preschoolers and kindergartners were asked to report initial letters with monosyllabic or disyllabic names (e.g., /kaf/ or /sam e x/, respectively) that included the cues described above. Correct responses increased with cue length; the effect was stronger with monosyllabic letter names than with disyllabic letter names, probably because the cue covered a larger ratio of the letter name. Phonological awareness was linked to use of letter names."

The contributions of phonological awareness, letter-sound matching skills, and rapid naming (RAN) to spelling and reading were measured in a large sample with Dutch children (N = 1,284) covering all primary school grades. The results indicated a different developmental pattern for spelling than for reading. At initial phases of literacy acquisition, phonological awareness and letter-sound matching skills contributed to both reading and spelling performance. However, in contrast to the declining influence of phonological awareness and letter-sound matching skills on fluent word reading (see also Vaessen & Blomert, 2010), the contributions of these skills to spelling performance were stable over the years, suggesting an ongoing reliance on orthography/phonology mappings during spelling. RAN did not contribute to spelling performance in any of the grades, in contrast to i..."

It was assumed that mothers' and fathers' teaching during kindergarten would be influenced by their socioeconomic status and their own learning difficulties, whereas during Grade 1 by their children's academic performance. A total of 189 mothers and 165 fathers filled in questionnaires regarding their teaching of reading and mathematics twice, once in kindergarten and once in Grade 1. Children's reading and mathematics performance was also examined twice, once in kindergarten and once in Grade 1. The results showed that the lower the socioeconomic status of mothers and fathers, the more teaching of reading and mathematics they reported. Moreover, the lower the children's academic performance in reading and mathematics in the beginning of Grade 1, the more teaching by mothers and fathers reported later on. Overall, the results suggest that mothers and fathers adjust their teaching to the actual skill level of their children when their children enter primary school."

A total of 30 first-grade Korean ELs were screened three times during the year using early literacy measures from DIBELS. A sample of students was provided an empirically supported phonological awareness (PA) intervention to determine whether DIBELS measures were sensitive to growth caused by an intervention. Results suggest screening measures of phoneme segmentation fluency (phoneme segmentation fluency, PSF) were not predictive of reading performance at the middle and end of first grade. Measures of alphabetics (nonsense word fluency, NWF) were predictive of reading skills for this sample of first-grade Korean ELs. PSF and NWF were sensitive to change caused by an intervention, and appear to be able to be used to monitor the impact of a PA intervention. Implications and recommendations for the use of DIBELS with Korean speaking ELs are provided."

Daley","We examined whether storybook exposure and the amount of teaching in reading and writing skills reported by middle class parents were related to the oral-language skills (receptive vocabulary, listening comprehension, and phoneme awareness) and the written-language skills (concepts about book reading, alphabet knowledge, reading CVC words, and invented spelling) of children in kindergarten (n = 110) and Grade 1 (n = 47). Hierarchical regression analyses that controlled for parents' print exposure and children's age and analytic intelligence showed that storybook exposure explained statistically significant unique variance in children's oral-language skills but not in their written-language skills. In contrast, parent teaching explained statistically significant unique variance in children's written-language skills but not in their oral-language skills. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that storybook exposure may enhance children's oral-language skills whereas additional support in the form of teaching may be necessary to enhance written-language skills. At the end of Grade 1, children's oral and written language performance accounted for 20% of the variance in word reading, but storybook exposure and parent teaching did not account for additional statistically significant unique variance. These findings suggest that the association between early home literacy experiences and later reading skills may be mediated through children's oral- and written-language skills.

EXAMINAMOS SI la exposicion a libros de cuentos y la cantidad de experiencias de ensenanza de habilidades de lectura y escritura, obtenidas a partir de los informes de padres de clase media, estaban relacionadas con las habilidades de lenguaje oral (vocabulario receptivo, comprension oral y concienca fonologica) y con las habilidades de lenguaje escrito (conceptos sobre la lectura de libros, conocimiento del alfabeto, lectura de palabras CVC y escrituras inventadas). Participaron del estudio ninos de preescolar (n = 110) y 1er. Grado (n = 47). Los analisis de regresion jerarquica, controlando la exposiscion a la lengua escrita de los padres y, la edad de los ninos y la inteligencia analitica, mostraron que la exposicion a libros de cuentos explico una proporcion unica estadisticamente significativa de la variancia en las habilidades de lenguaje oral pero no en las habilidades de lenguaje escrito. Por el contrario, la ensenanza de los padres explico una proporcion unica estadisticamente significativa de la variancia en las habilidades de lenguaje escrito pero no en las habilidades de lenguaje oral. Estos hallazgos son consistentes con la hipotesis de que la exposicion a libros de cuentos puede mejorar las habilidades de lenguaje oral de los ninos, en tanto que puede ser necesario un apoyo adicional en la forma de ensenar para mejorar las habilidades de lenguaje escrito. A fines de 1er. Grado, el desempeno oral y escrito de los ninos dio cuenta del 20% de la variancia en lectura de palabras, pero la exposicion a libros de cuentos y la ensenanza de los padres no explico una proporcion adicional estadisticamente significativa de la variancia. Estos hallazgos sugieren que la asociacion entre las experiencias de alfabetizacion tempranas en el hogar y las habilidades de lectura posteriores pueden estar mediadas por las habilidades de lenguaje oral y escrito de los ninos.

UNTERSUCHTEN, ob der Einflus von Geschichten und die Unterrichtsanzahl beim Vermitteln von Lese- und Schreibfertigkeiten, wie von Eltern der Mittelschicht berichtet, in einer Beziehung mit den mundlichen Sprachfertigkeiten (rezeptiver Wortschatz, Horverstandnis und phonemische Aufnahmefahigkeit) standen, und verglichen sprachliche Schreibfertigkeiten (Konzepte zum Buchlesen, Kenntnis des Alphabets, Lesen von CVC [Consonant-Vowel-Consonant bzw. Konsonant-Vokal-Konsonant] Worten und ersonnenes Buchstabieren) von Kindern im Kindergarten (n = 110) und in der 1. Klasse (n = 47). Hierarchische Regressionsanalysen zur kontrollierten Bemessung des elterlichen Aufwands an Druckmaterial, dem Alter der Kinder und deren analytischer Intelligenz zeigten, das der Bucheinflus von Geschichten statistisch eine deutliche, ausgepragte Abweichung bei der Bemessung der mundlichen Sprachfahigkeiten bei diesen Kindern aufweist, jedoch nicht bei deren Schreibfahigkeiten. Im Widerspruch dazu ergab elterlicher Unterricht statistisch wesentliche Abweichungen bei den Schreibfertigkeiten der Kinder, jedoch nicht bei deren mundlichen Sprachfahigkeiten. Diese Erkenntnisse befinden sich im Einklang mit der Hypothese, das das Anbieten bzw. Lesen von Geschichten aus Buchern mundliche Sprachfertigkeiten steigern kann, wobei zusatzliche Unterstutzung in Form von Unterricht notig werden konnte, um schriftliche Sprachfahigkeiten zu fordern. Mit Abschlus der 1. Klasse betrug die Veranderung in der mundlichen und schriftlichen Sprachleistung 20% beim Lesen von Worten, jedoch konnte die Heranfuhrung an Geschichten aus Buchern und der elterliche Unterricht statistisch nicht mehr als besonders herausragende Abweichung nachgewiesen werden. Diese Befunde lassen vermuten, das die Verbindung zwischen fruhzeitigen Sprachausbildungserfahrungen zu Hause und spateren Leseleistungen durch erworbene mundliche und schriftliche Sprachfertigkeiten der Kinder vermittelt wird.

Des analyses de regression hierarchique controlant l'exposition a l'ecrit par les parents, l'âge de l'enfant et l'intelligence analytique ont montre que l'exposition a la lecture de livres de jeunesse rend compte d'une variation statistiquement significative des competences en langue parlee des enfants, mais pas de leurs competences en langue ecrite. Par contre, l'enseignement effectue par les parents rend compte d'une variation statistiquement significative des competences en langue ecrite des enfants, mais non de leurs competences en langue parlee. Ces resultats sont en harmonie avec l'hypothese que l'exposition a la lecture de livres de jeunesse permet d'ameliorer les competences des enfants en langue parlee, tandis qu'un apport supplementaire sous forme d'enseignement peut s'averer necessaire pour ameliorer leurs competences en langue ecrite. En fin de premiere annee, la connaissance qu'ont les enfants du langage oral et ecrit rend compte de 20% de la variance en lecture de livres, alors que l'exposition a la lecture de livres de jeunesse et l'enseignement effectue par les parents n'apportent pas de contribution supplementaire a la variance.

Quinlan, Holly Garwood","Two groups of 8- to 10-year-olds differing in rapid automatized naming speed but matched for age, verbal and nonverbal ability, phonological awareness, phonological memory, and visual acuity participated in four experiments investigating early visual processing. As low RAN children had significantly slower simple reaction times (SRT) this was entered as a covariate in all subsequent data analyses. Low RAN children were significantly slower to make same/different judgments to simple visual features, non-nameable letter-like forms and letters, with difference in SRT controlled. Speed differences to letter-like forms and letters disappeared once RTs to simple visual features were controlled. We conclude that slow RAN children have difficulty in discriminating simple visual features that cannot be explained in terms of a more general speed of processing deficit, a deficit in making same/different judgments, or to differences in word reading ability."

Since the first documented cases at the beginning of the last century, it has become increasingly apparent that the reading problems of people with dyslexia form part of a heritable neurobiological syndrome. As for most cognitive and behavioural traits, phenotypic definition is fraught with difficulties and the genetic basis is complex, making the isolation of genetic risk factors a formidable challenge. Against such a background, it is notable that several recent studies have reported the localization of genes that influence dyslexia and other language-related traits. These investigations exploit novel research approaches that are relevant to many areas of human neurogenetics."

The amount of time first-grade teachers spent reading to their students was unrelated to the reading achievement of their students. Results are discussed in terms of a “displacement theory.” In other words, teachers who read the most spent the least amount of time in teaching activities that were positively correlated with reading achievement. Further information gathered from parent questionnaires about the time they spend reading to their children and the children's independent reading reveal a positive relationship between reading achievement and the time children spend engaged with print, but no relationship between reading achievement and the amount of time parents spent reading to their children.

This paper reviews evidence for oral language components, shown to have predictive capacity to identify at-risk readers at an early age. Both phonological and non-phonological components of oral language difficulties are linked to poor reading outcomes in a majority of children. At-risk preschoolers may present with phonological deficits, sub-clinical or clinical language impairment. The nature and importantly the trajectory of reading difficulty will vary, depending on the area of language breakdown. Irrespective, difficulty with reading comprehension is likely to result. Importantly, the variation in the trajectory of reading difficulty means that some children may struggle during the initial phases of learning to read, whereas others may experience initial success, but encounter difficulties at a later point when reading demands increase. Clinical implications for speech-language pathology assessment ..."

Children were divided into four groups based on their language and cognitive performance. The findings from this study show that as early as preschool, children with weaker oral language skills lag behind their peers with stronger oral language skills in terms of their writing-related skills.

Bartlett","While advances in network and pathway analysis have flourished in the era of genome-wide association analysis, understanding the genetic mechanism of individual loci on phenotypes is still readily accomplished using genetic modeling approaches. Here, we demonstrate two novel genotype-phenotype models implemented in a flexible genetic modeling platform. The examples come from analysis of families with specific language impairment (SLI), a failure to develop normal language without explanatory factors such as low IQ or inadequate environment. In previous genome-wide studies, we observed strong evidence for linkage to 13q21 with a reading phenotype in language-impaired families. First, we elucidate the genetic architecture of reading impairment and quantitative language variation in our samples using a bivariate analysis of reading impairment in affected individuals jointly with language quantitative phenotypes in unaffected individuals. This analysis largely recapitulates the baseline analysis using the categorical trait data (posterior probability of linkage (PPL) = 80%), indicating that our reading impairment phenotype captured poor readers who also have low language ability. Second, we performed epistasis analysis using a functional coding variant in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene previously associated with reduced performance on working memory tasks. Modeling epistasis doubled the evidence on 13q21 and raised the PPL to 99.9%, indicating that BDNF and 13q21 susceptibility alleles are jointly part of the genetic architecture of SLI. These analyses provide possible mechanistic insights for further cognitive neuroscience studies based on the models developed herein."

ANCOVA results revealed that the French immersion children outperformed the other two groups on measures of English phonological awareness and word reading and that the bilingual groups were comparable to monolingual English norms on a test of receptive vocabulary. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine cross-language transfer of skills. French morphological awareness explained unique variance in English word reading and vocabulary for the French immersion group. For the other two groups, Chinese phonological awareness was significantly related to English word reading. Our results suggest that instruction in French or Chinese does not delay the development of early English language and literacy skills for Chinese-speaking children, as the children may be able to leverage skills from their other language to facilitate their English learning."

O'Neill","Auditory neurons tuned to the direction and rate of frequency modulations (FM) might underlie the encoding of frequency sweeps in animal vocalizations and formant transitions in human speech. We examined the relationship between FM direction and rate selectivity and the precise temporal interactions of excitatory and inhibitory sideband inputs. Extracellular single-unit recordings were made in the auditory midbrains of eight mustached bats. Up- and down-sweeping linear FM stimuli were presented at different modulation rates in order to determine FM selectivity. Brief tone pairs with varying interstimulus delays were presented in a forward masking paradigm to examine the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. In the 33 units for which tone pair data were collected, a correspondence existed between FM rate selectivity and the time delays between paired tones. Moreover, FM directional selectivity was strongly linked to rate selectivity, because directional preferences were expressed only at certain rates and not others. We discuss how abnormalities in the relative timing of inputs could alter or abolish the selectivity of such neurons, and how such a mechanism could account for the perceptual deficits for formant transitions seen in certain children with phonological deficits."

However, there is no evidence for “perceptual impairment” underlying dyslexic subjects' low scores and prolonged latencies, as the distribution of their errors is similar to that of normal children. Rather it is the nondyslexic MBD group which produces a high percentage of wrong names, suggestive of mistaking the pictured stimuli for other, visually similar, objects."

A sample of 72 children were followed from the beginning of kindergarten until the end of Grade 1 and were assessed on measures of RAN, general cognitive ability, speed of processing, attention, working memory, phonological awareness, reading, and mathematics. The results indicated that pause time was the critical component in both the RAN–reading and RAN–mathematics relationships and that it shared most of its predictive variance in reading and mathematics with speed of processing and working memory. Our findings further suggested that, unlike the relationship between RAN and reading fluency in Grade 1, there is nothing in the RAN task that is uniquely related to math."

Seventy-one preschoolers aged 3–5 from a low SES township in central Israel (35 in the reading program and 36 in the writing program) participated in evaluation of the interventions. Twenty-four untreated preschoolers served as a control group. The children were tested twice, at the beginning and at the end of the school year, in: phonological awareness, word writing, letter knowledge, orthographic awareness, listening comprehension, receptive vocabulary, and general knowledge. Both programs involved games and creative activities. The writing program encouraged letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and functional writing activities. The reading program utilized 11 children's books for focusing on language and exploring major concepts raised by these books. Results indicated that children in the two literacy programs progressed significantly more than the control group on phonological awareness and orthographic awareness. However, the joint writing group significantly outperformed both the joint reading group and the control group on phonological awareness, word writing, orthographic awareness, and letter knowledge. We also found that children as young as 3–4 years gained from literacy programs as much as did older children, aged 4–5, on all the measures assessed in our program."

The simple view of reading states that reading comprehension is related to decoding and oral language comprehension skills. One hundred thirty-one Spanish-speaking English learners (ELs) were tested in 1st grade and many were followed into 2nd grade, including a full sample of 79. Structural equation modeling confirmed that a 5-factor measurement model had the best fit, suggesting that L1 and L2 phonological awareness should be viewed as separate but related constructs and that L1 and L2 oral language proficiency, measured by vocabulary and grammatical awareness, were separate constructs. The structural model indicated that for this group of ELs, who were educated in English, English oral language proficiency and word reading were the strongest predictors of English reading comprehension. Other models that deleted 1 of these crucial components resulted in significantly poorer fit. Therefore, the results support the validity of the simple view of reading as a model for the development of reading comprehension in young ELs. Implications for theory and practice, specifically assessment of ELs, are discussed."

Hayiou-Thomas,"Abstract The genetic and environmental etiology of speech and broader language skills was examined in terms of their concurrent relationships in young children; their longitudinal association with reading; and the role they play in defining the ‘heritable phenotype’ for specific language impairment (SLI). The work was based on a large sample of 4 1/2-year-old twins, who were assessed at home on a broad range of speech and language measures as part of the Twins Early Development Study. We found that genetic factors strongly influence variation in young children's speech in typical development as well as in SLI, and that these genetic factors also account for much of the relationship between early speech and later reading. In contrast, shared environmental factors play a more dominant role for broader language skills, and in relating these skills to later reading; isolated impairments in language as opposed to speech appear to have largely environmental origins. Learning outcomes (1) Readers will be able to discuss some of the ways in which behavioural genetic methods can make a useful contribution to the field of communication disorders. (2) Readers will be able to compare the genetic and environmental contributions to general language versus speech skills in young children.

Marshall, Margaret J. Snowling, Peter J. Bailey","According to a prominent theory, the phonological difficulties in dyslexia are caused by an underlying general impairment in the ability to process sequences of rapidly presented, brief sounds. Two studies examined this theory by exploring the relationships between rapid auditory processing and phonological processing in a sample of 82 normally reading children (Study 1) and by comparing 17 children with dyslexia to chronological-age and reading-age control participants on these tasks (Study 2). In the normal readers, moderate correlations were found between the measure of rapid auditory processing (Auditory Repetition Task, or ART) and phonological ability. On the ART, the dyslexia group performed at a level similar to that of the reading-age control group but obtained scores that were significantly below those of the chronological-age control group. This difference was due to a subgroup of 4 children in the dyslexia group who had particular difficulty with the ART. The phonological skills of these individuals were not worse than those of the children in the dyslexia group who were unimpaired on the ART. The discussion argues that there is no evidence that phonological difficulties are secondary to impairments of rapid auditory processing, as measured by the ART, and highlights the need to examine the strategic and cognitive demands involved in tasks of rapid auditory processing."

Donohue, Daniel R. Brady, Kristy Nace, Jay N. Giedd, Paul Andreason","Background: Imaging studies have suggested anomalous anatomical asymmetries in language-related regions of the temporal and parietal lobes in individuals with developmental dyslexia. Autopsy studies have reported unusual symmetry of the planum temporale (PT) in patients with dyslexia. Methodological limitations characterize much of this literature, however. Objective: To examine the size and asymmetry of the PT and its extension into the parietal lobe (planum parietale [PP]) in men with well-characterized, persistent dyslexia by using magnetic resonance imaging and 3-dimensional surface rendering techniques. Methods: The brains of 16 right-handed dyslexic men aged 18 to 40 years and 14 matched control subjects were studied with magnetic resonance imaging. Most of these subjects were previously studied with positron emission tomography, which demonstrated functional abnormalities in temporal and parietal brain regions in the dyslexic group. The area of the PT was determined with the aid of 3-dimensional surface-rendering techniques. The size of the PP was estimated by measuring the length of the posterior ascending ramus on 3 parasagittal slices. Results: Approximately 70% to 80% of both groups showed equivalent leftward (left>right) asymmetries of the PT; approximately 50% to 60% showed equivalent rightward (right>left) asymmetries of the PP. These asymmetries showed equivalent moderate inverse correlations with each other in both groups. Conclusions: These results challenge the notion that anomalous asymmetry of the PT is strongly associated with developmental dyslexia. Given the heterogeneity of the dyslexic population, some subgroup of dyslexic individuals (ie, those with developmental language disorders) may show unusual symmetry or reversed asymmetry in this region. However, anomalous asymmetry of the planum did not contribute to functional abnormalities demonstrated in these patients by positron emission tomography."

In a series of hierarchical regression analyses, RAN explained more variance in word and nonword reading fluency than PA, whereas PA explained more variance in spelling than RAN. This pattern was confirmed when PA response times were assessed instead of response accuracy. Two further regression models challenge the view that the RAN-literacy association is mediated by orthographic processing. First, RAN accounts for unique variance in word reading fluency even when differences in orthographic spelling were introduced before RAN. Second, RAN accounts for hardly any variance in word reading fluency when introduced after nonword reading fluency."

To test the hypothesis that parent speech provides children with information about these differences, we studied parent–child conversations in CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000). We found that parents talk to their young children about letters, differentiating them from pictures, by 1–2 years of age and that some of these conversational patterns change across the preschool years in ways that emphasize important features of letters, such as their shape. We also found that children talk about letters and pictures in distinct ways, suggesting an implicit understanding of some of the differences between letters and pictures at an early age. Some differences in parent–child conversations about letters were found as a function of socioeconomic status: Lower SES families appeared to focus more on alphabetic order than higher SES families. The general letter knowledge expressed in these conversations suggests that everyday interactions are an important component of the home literacy environment and that they differ, in some respects, as a function of child age and family background."

Badian,"The main aim of the study was to determine whether performance on reading-related cognitive processing tasks would help predict reading progress in children receiving special help. The 86 subjects were initially aged six to eight years and most were followed up after two years. When variance due to IQ and age was accounted for, an orthographic processing task, phonological awareness (phoneme deletion), and digit- naming speed were significant predictors of later reading skills. A strength in phonological awareness differentiated initial poor readers who later made excellent gains in reading from poor readers who did not improve. Children whose reading deteriorated had serious weaknesses on tasks of naming speed and confrontation naming. Their poor lexical retrieval skills had a more deleterious effect on later reading than on initial. Indications were that for children diagnosed as poor readers at age six or seven years, prognosis is better for boys, and for garden- variety poor readers, than for dyslexics. Caution was urged in applying the term dyslexic to children in the first two school grades because many of them will be slow starters who do not have a persistent reading problem."

Grigorenko","Abstract Associative learning has been identified as one of several non-linguistic processes involved in reading acquisition. However, it has not been established whether it is an independent process that contributes to reading performance on its own or whether it is a process that is embedded in other linguistic skills (e.g., phonological awareness or phonological memory) and, therefore, contributing to reading performance indirectly. Research has shown that performance on tasks assessing associative learning, e.g., paired-associate learning (PAL) tasks, is lower in children with specific reading difficulties compared to typical readers. We explored the differential associations of two distinct verbal–visual PAL tasks (the Bala Bbala Graphogame, BBG, and a Foreign Language Learning Task, FLLT) with reading skills (word reading and pseudo-word decoding), controlling for phonological awareness, rapid naming, and letter and digit span in children at risk for reading disabilities and their typically developing peers. Our study sample consisted of 110 children living in rural Zambia, ranging in age from 7 to 18 years old (48.1% female). Multivariate analyses of covariance were used to explore the group differences in reading performance. Repeated-measures ANCOVA was used to examine children's learning across the PAL tasks. The differential relationships between both PAL tasks and reading performance were explored via structural equation modeling. The main result was that the children at risk for reading difficulties had lower performance on both PAL tasks. The BBG was a significant predictor for both word reading and pseudo-word decoding, whereas the FLLT—only for word reading. Performance on the FLLT partially mediated the association between phonological awareness and word reading. These results illustrate the partial independence of associative learning from other reading-related skills; the specifics of this relationship vary based on the type of PAL task administered."

Children in French immersion programs were asked to play a dictionary game when they were in Grade 2 and again when they were in Grade 3. They were shown pseudowords that contained either an English spelling pattern or a French spelling pattern, and they were asked to decide whether each pseudoword should go in an English dictionary or a French dictionary if it became a real word. Comparison groups of monolingual English children, monolingual French children, and English–French bilingual university students were also tested on the task. French immersion students in both grades were above chance in discriminating between the two types of pseudowords but were well below adult performance on the task. Measures obtained in kindergarten showed that early print knowledge had some ability to predict later ability to discriminate between the orthographic patterns of the two languages. Further analyses indicated that exposure to print in each language in Grades 1 to 3 was strongly related to discrimination performance. The findings are interpreted as being consistent with the statistical learning hypothesis."

The purpose of this study was to investigate how computerized sounding out influenced spelling accuracy of pseudo-words. Computerized sounding out was defined as a word elongated, thus providing an opportunity for a child to hear all the sounds in the word at a slower rate. Methods: Seven children with cerebral palsy, four who use AAC and three who do not, participated in a single subject AB design. Results: The results of the study indicated that the use of computerized sounding out increased the phonologic accuracy of the pseudo-words produced by participants.

We examined the convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of these phonological processing abilities (PPA) in 389 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of each PPA as separate from general cognitive ability and separate from each other. Multigroup structural equation modeling (SEM) with mean structure demonstrated that older preschoolers have better developed latent PPA than younger preschoolers but that the structure of PPA is equivalent. RAN was found uniquely associated with letter knowledge and text discrimination in younger preschoolers, and PA was found uniquely associated with word reading skills in older preschoolers. Finally, general cognitive ability was only indirectly associated with emergent literacy via PPA. These results highlight the importance of PPA in the early literacy development of English-speaking preschool children."

Hill,"In the light of emerging suggestions that language and motor deficits may co-occur, the literature on specific language impairment (SLI) was reviewed to investigate the prevalence of co-morbidity between SLI and poor limb motor skill in children diagnosed with language mpairments. An extensive literature search was undertaken and the subsequent findings evaluated with particular reference to issues surrounding symptom co-occurrence, as well as to theoretical and aetiological accounts of SLI. Clearly substantial co-morbidity exists between SLI and poor motor skill, suggesting that SLI is not a specific disorder of language, but rather that children with SLI experience a broader range of
diYculties, of which motor incoordination is one. Current theoretical explanations of SLI do not account fully for such wide-ranging diYculties and it may be useful in the future to focus on a more detailed explanation in terms of
shared cognitive processes or neuromaturational delay to understand further the nature of the disorder, to explain it theoretically and to deal with it practically."

Holly Fitch, Paula Tallal","The acquisition of speech perception and consequent expression of language represent fundamental aspects of human functioning. Yet roughly 7% to 8% of children who are otherwise healthy and of normal intelligence exhibit unexplained delays and impairments in acquiring these skills. Ongoing research has revealed several key features of language disability that may pro-vide more direct insight into underlying anomalous neural functioning. For example, evidence supports a strong association between basic defects in processing rapidly changing acoustic information and emergent disruptions in speech perception, as well as cascading effects on other forms of language development (including reading). Considerable neurobiological research has thus focused on developmental factors that might deleteriously influence rapid sensory processing. Additional research focuses on mechanisms of neural plasticity, including how such brains might be “retrained” for improved processing of language. These and related findings f..."

Even less research has examined the phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN) skills in these two groups of children and how these skills relate to reading and math achievement. Additionally, various classification criteria are frequently implemented to classify children with MD. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the PA and RAN skills in children who met different criteria for RD only and children with RD who are at risk for mathematics difficulties (MDR). Participants were 114 second- or third-grade students with RD from public elementary schools in three large metropolitan areas. Students were classified as at risk for mathematics difficulties utilizing a 25th-percentile cutoff and a 15th-percentile cutoff as assessed by the KeyMath-Revised Test (Connolly, 1988). A series of PA and RAN measures were administered along with a range of reading and mathematics measures. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that children with RD only evidenced a different pattern of results compared to children with RD + MDR. Additionally, using a more stringent criterion to classify children at risk for mathematics difficulties resulted in a differential pattern of results when compared to a less stringent classification criterion."

Structural equation modeling of continuity suggested effects from growth in early vocabulary to mastery of inflectional forms at preschool age. The early language directly influenced early phonological awareness (PA) and only indirectly influenced later development in PA and word reading. The course of development in PA progressed from detecting larger multiphonemic units toward recognizing and producing phonemes in words, which, in turn, were positively associated with differences in producing new words by deleting and blending phonemes at kindergarten age. Including word reading before school entry levelled out the influence of the concurrent phonemic awareness factor on reading at first grade. Hence, in a highly inflected language with a transparent orthography, the pathway to reading consisted of skills learned in succession, the last phase being characterized by simultaneous development involving phonemic awareness and emerging reading skill. The finding led to the conclusion that, in addition to universal routes, language- and culture-specific routes to literacy must be acknowledged when searching for the precursors to reading at school age."

Yet the nuances of how learning from book reading might vary across these contexts and with children's skills are not well understood. One hundred and thirty children participating in a longitudinal investigation of literacy development were videotaped reading a storybook with a parent. Children were also videotaped in their 33 preschool classrooms during the instructional book-reading portion of the day. Readings were coded for adult and child contextualized and decontextualized language relating to both decoding and meaning-making skills, and relations between this talk and emergent literacy outcomes were analyzed. Results demonstrate that parents and teachers overwhelmingly focus their book-related talk on meaning-related rather than code-related information, and that the relations between outcomes and talk depend in part on children's initial levels of vocabulary skills. Implications for practice and research are discussed."
866,2056831274,is nonword repetition a test of phonological memory or long term knowledge it all depends on the nonwords,1995,10.3758/BF03210559,Memory & Cognition,Susan E. Gathercole,"The extent to which children's performance on tests of nonword repetition is constrained by phonological working memory and long-term lexical knowledge was investigated in a longitudinal study of 70 children tested at 4 and 5 years of age. At each time of testing, measures of nonword repetition, memory span, and vocabulary knowledge were obtained. Reading ability was also assessed at 5 years. At both ages, repetition accuracy was greater for nonwords of high- rather than low-rated wordlikeness, and memory-span measures were more closely related to repetition accuracy for the low-wordlike than for the high-wordlike stimuli. It is argued that these findings indicate that nonword repetition for unwordlike stimuli is largely dependent on phonological memory, whereas repetition for wordlike items is also mediated by long-term lexical knowledge and is therefore less sensitive to phonological memory constraints. Reading achievement was selectively linked with earlier repetition scores for low-wordlike nonwords, suggesting a phonological memory contribution in the early stages of reading development. Vocabulary knowledge was associated with repetition accuracy for both low- and high-wordlike nonwords, consistent with the notion that lexical knowledge and nonword repetition share a reciprocal developmental relationship."

Children (n = 383) were tested individually twice each year for up to 4 years on measures of phonological awareness, decoding, reading comprehension, and vocabulary. Growth curve analyses indicated that schooling effects were greatest for decoding skills and reading comprehension, were medium in size for phonological awareness, and were less evident for vocabulary. Except for vocabulary, relatively small amounts of growth were observed for preschoolers, followed by a period of rapid growth for kindergarteners and first graders, which slowed again for second graders. Findings demonstrate the differential effect of schooling on four separate literacy skills during the crucial school transition period."

Participants Children exposed to cocaine in utero (PCE; n  = 175) and non-exposed children (NCE; n  = 175) were followed prospectively to 10 years of age and were compared on language subscales of the Test of Language Development-Intermediate 3rd Edition (TOLD-I:3) and phonological processing as measured by the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP). Methods Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), linear regression, and logistic regressions were used to evaluate the relationship of prenatal cocaine exposure to language development, while controlling for confounders. Results After controlling for confounding variables, prenatal cocaine effects were observed for specific aspects of language including syntax (Sentence Combining subtest of the TOLD-I:3, p  = 0.001), semantics (Malopropism subtest of the TOLD-I:3, p  = 0.05) and phonological processing (Phonological Awareness subscale, p  = 0.01). The caregiver factors of vocabulary, HOME, and psychological symptoms also had consistent effects on language subtests and phonological processing scores. Children with PCE who experienced foster or adoptive care had enhanced language development compared to those living with birth mothers or in relative care. Cocaine exposed girls had lower scores on the phonological awareness subscale of the CTOPP than non-exposed girls. Conclusions PCE has subtle effects on specific aspects of language development and phonological processing at age 10, even after controlling for confounding variables. Environmental factors (i.e., postnatal lead exposure, home environment, and caregiver vocabulary and psychological symptoms) also impact language skills at 10 years. Adoptive or foster care appears to enrich PCE children's linguistic environment and protects children against language delay in the PCE sample."

Then, they were assessed on writing in third grade using three writing tasks — one narrative and two expository prompts. Children's written compositions were evaluated in terms of writing quality (the extent to which ideas were developed and presented in an organized manner). Structural equation modeling showed that kindergarten oral language and lexical literacy skills (i.e., word reading and spelling) were independently predicted third grade narrative writing quality, and kindergarten literacy skill uniquely predicted third grade expository writing quality. In contrast, attention and letter writing automaticity were not independently related to writing quality in either narrative or expository genre.

Ninety-six students (M age = 13.73) completed tests of word and pseudoword reading fluency, spelling, orthographic choice, phonological choice, phoneme awareness (PA), and RSN. PA was a better predictor of orthographic skills and pseudoword reading accuracy than RSN, which accounted for more variance in word and pseudoword reading fluency. Controlling for pseudoword reading fluency washed out RSN’s contribution to word reading fluency. These results extend previous findings questioning the role of RSN as an index of orthographic processing skills and support the idea that RSN taps into automaticity/efficiency of processing print-sound mappings."

It may be that children's abilities in one language do not contribute to their reading abilities in their other language or that children's experiences with either language assist them in developing a common underlying proficiency that they draw upon when learning to read. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship among bilingual children's receptive language development and reading outcomes in first grade. Eighty-one bilingual children who were attending Head Start participated in the study. Growth curve models were used to examine the relationship between children's language abilities during two years in Head Start and reading outcomes at the end of first grade. Children's growth in both English and Spanish receptive vocabulary and oral comprehension predicted their English and Spanish reading abilities at the end of first grade within languages. Associations were also observed between languages with growth in English receptive language predicting Spanish reading comprehension and growth in Spanish receptive language predicting English reading comprehension. Learning outcomes : The reader will be able to (1) describe the common underlying proficiency model; (2) identify key factors of consideration when studying bilingual children; (3) understand the associations between preschool language abilities in English and Spanish and English and Spanish reading outcomes; and (4) identify ways in which future clinical practice may be impacted by the study's findings."

The children were asked to select a choice word which “rhymes with or sounds like” a target word, but the authors only scored rhyme choices (“boat”–“coat”) as correct. Choices of words with the same onset as the target (“train”–“tractor”) were counted as mistakes, even though these latter choices also shared a common sound with the target. A better way to score the task is to count onset as well as rhyme choices as correct. The new score predicts reading and spelling as well as the phoneme tasks. This result is consistent with the hypothesis of Goswami and Bryant (1990) that sensitivity to onset and rhyme, as well as awareness of phonemes, plays a part in children's success in reading and to spelling."

Por un lado, obtener un indice de validez concurrente del CEG (Test de Comprension de Estructuras Gramaticales), tomando como criterio el rendimiento escolar de los alumnos, a juicio de sus tutores academicos, a traves de la Escala de Valoracion del Lenguaje Observable (EVLO) del CELF-3, edicion en espanol. Por otro lado, pretendiamos comprobar si las puntuaciones obtenidas en el CEG podrian ser un indicador del rendimiento escolar de los alumnos, esta vez tambien segun los criterios de los tutores. Con respecto al primer objetivo, la correlacion obtenida entre la puntuacion total del CEG y cada uno de los apartados de la EVLO es significativa en todos ellos, oscilando los valores entre -0,477 (escucha) y -0,621 (escribe). Dado que las preguntas formuladas en la EVLO son todas referidas a aspectos linguisticos en sus dominios orales y escritos, podemos afirmar que el CEG es un instrumento valido a efectos de la determinacion del rendimiento escolar de los ninos en el ambito linguistico. En lo referente al segundo objetivo nuestros resultados indican que el rendimiento academico de los ninos que puntuan por encima del centil 67 en el CEG es valorado por sus tutores de forma muy positiva, a la inversa de lo que sucede con los ninos cuyas puntuaciones en el CEG se situan por debajo del centil 33. Se puede, por tanto, concluir, que las dificultades de comprension del lenguaje oral pueden estar en el origen de los problemas de rendimiento academico en el area del lenguaje que presentan algunos ninos."

Stahl","Previous research suggests that children who are successful in phoneme awareness tasks also have high levels of alphabet knowledge. One connection between the two might be alphabet books. Such books typically include both letter-name information and phonological information about initial sounds (‘B is for bear’). It may be that children who are read alphabet books, and thus understand how B is for bear, will learn both letter names and be able to isolate phonemes. To examine this, we gave three treatments to different groups of prekindergarteners. In the first group, the teacher read conventional alphabet books. In the second, the teacher read books chosen to contain the letter names only, without example words to demonstrate sound values. The third group, a control, read only storybooks. We found that all groups gained in print concept and letter knowledge over the course of the study. The conventional alphabet group made significantly greater gains in phoneme awareness than the group that read books about letters without example words, suggesting that conventional alphabet books may be one route to the development of phoneme awareness."

Analyses of variance revealed main effects of each factor, oftentimes modified by significant interactions, on the varied achievement measures. All deficit groups performed below the DA children. Compared to children with NSD, children with PD (a) were less accurate decoders, (b) were faster readers, (c) had weaker spelling dictation, and (d) had comparably poor spelling recognition scores.

Psychophysical thresholds were estimated for gap-detection, frequency modulation detection, and tone-in-noise detection using a three-interval forced-choice adaptive staircase paradigm embedded within a computer game. Phonological skills were measured by tasks assessing phonological awareness, rapid serial naming, and verbal short-term memory. Significant group differences were found for phonological awareness and letter knowledge. In contrast, none of the auditory tasks differentiated significantly between both groups. However, both frequency modulation and tone-in-noise detection were significantly related to phonological awareness. This relation with phonological skills was not present for gap-detection."

Seymour, Mikko Aro, Jane Erskine","Several previous studies have suggested that basic decoding skills may develop less effectively in English than in some other European orthographies. The origins of this effect in the early (foundation) phase of reading acquisition are investigated through assessments of letter knowledge, familiar word reading, and simple nonword reading in English and 12 other orthographies. The results confirm that children from a majority of European countries become accurate and fluent in foundation level reading before the end of the first school year. There are some exceptions, notably in French, Portuguese, Danish, and, particularly, in English. The effects appear not to be attributable to differences in age of starting or letter knowledge. It is argued that fundamental linguistic differences in syllabic complexity and orthographic depth are responsible. Syllabic complexity selectively affects decoding, whereas orthographic depth affects both word reading and nonword reading. The rate of development in English is more than twice as slow as in the shallow orthographies. It is hypothesized that the deeper orthographies induce the implementation of a dual (logographic + alphabetic) foundation which takes more than twice as long to establish as the single foundation required for the learning of a shallow orthography."

These assumptions were that cognition and reading are related (and interdependent) processes and that a specific type of reading difficulty ‐‐ dyslexia ‐‐ characterized a distinct group of poor readers ‐ i.e. those with average and better intellectual ability. In this context, the word ‘dyslexia’ refers (more precisely) to specific developmental dyslexia (SDD), as opposed to ‘acquired’ dyslexia, reading difficulty, which arises as a result of illness or injury. A study by Rutter and Yule challenged both (by then long‐standing) assumptions and proposed that reading difficulty might be seen as a developmental outcome of early language related deficit or delay and environmental factors. This notion has not been adequately explored, mainly because of a continued theoretical bias towards reading/IQ discrepancy m..."

At the beginning of the study, children's prelinguistic behavior regulation, social interaction, and joint attention were measured. One year later, children's expressive vocabulary was measured. Results indicated that rate of joint attention and rate of communication were statistically significant predictors of later expressive vocabulary. Rate of behavior regulation was not a predictor.

Method Participants were 151 kindergarten and first-grade children and 40 SLPs. Video-recorded therapy sessions were coded to determine the amount of time that addressed literacy. Assessments of children's literacy skills were administered as well as questionnaires regarding characteristics of SLPs (e.g., service delivery, professional development). Results Results showed that time spent addressing code-related literacy across therapy sessions was variable. Significant predictors included SLP years of experience, therapy location, and therapy session duration, such that children receiving services from SLPs with more years of experience, and/or who utilized the classroom for therapy, received more literacy-focused time. Additionally, children in longer therapy sessions received more therapy time on literacy skills. Conclusions There is considerable variability in the extent to which children received literacy-focused time in therapy; however, SLP-level factors predict time spent in literacy more than child-level factors. Further research is needed to understand the nature of literacy-focused therapy in the public schools. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to: (a) define code-based literacy skills, (b) discuss the role that speech-language pathologists have in fostering children's literacy development, and (c) identify key factors that may currently influence the inclusion of literacy targets in school-based speech-language therapy."

The acquisition of literacy in an alphabetic script such as English makes heavy demands on linguistic skills. The relation between spoken and written language however, is far from straightforward. This article reviews the research that suggests that phonological processing skills are crucial in the translation of symbols to sounds, and the development of rapid and automatic decoding skills. It examines research that indicates that children whose phonological processing skills are compromised in some way, are at-risk of experiencing difficulties in the acquisition of literacy; it supports the suggestion that dyslexia can be viewed as lying on the continuum of developmental language disorders. It goes on to relate theory to practice and discusses the responsibilities of health care professionals in relation to the early identification of dyslexia, and makes suggestions regarding intervention. In particular, it looks at the responsibilities of speech and language therapy services in the care and management of children with dyslexia."

Visual TOTs were not predictive of literacy measures; auditory TOTs in Grade 1 were the best predictor. Interestingly, they were related to spelling in Grade 2 while auditory TOTs in Grade 2 were not, suggesting that rapid auditory processing abilities have a causal influence on literacy development."

The purpose of this longitudinal retrospective study was to further define the Q1 relationship between the development of prereading skills and later reading outcome in two groups of children; a group of reading disabled children, and a group of their normally reading peers. Children’s alphabetic knowledge, phonological awareness, and rapid naming skills were explored at the beginning of kindergarten and again prior to first grade as a function of later reading outcomes. Results indicate that differences found between the groups in all measures at prekindergarten age diminish by prefirst grade with the exception of phonological awareness abilities.

Evidence from a completed cross-sectional study will be briefly summarized and an ongoing longitudinal study will be presented to suggest that factors disrupting specific stages of the naming process can impede the development of children’s reading in particular, perhaps predictable, ways. Based on the components of a neurolinguistic model of naming, a battery of naming and reading tests was administered to a longitudinal sample of 115 children before, during, and after reading acquisition. Preliminary trends indicate that poor readers are significantly different (p<.001) from average readers on all naming tests except those emphasizingreceptive vocabulary perception. Tests emphasizing retrieval rate are best able to predict patterns of naming performance and errors characterize specific subgroups of the dyslexias."

Children's phonological awareness and letter naming–decoding fluency grew significantly from fall to spring. On average, across the three 60 min observations, teachers provided over 30 min a day of phonological awareness and phonics instruction and 15 min a day of vocabulary and comprehension instruction. Global ratings of instructional quality revealed two implementation factors: explicit and individualized implementation and meaningful interactions around text. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that the amounts of specific instructional content, as well as how this instruction was implemented, was related to students' letter knowledge and phonological awareness skill growth."

The main characteristic that adults with dyslexia present is a low speed when reading. In Spanish, a shallow orthographic system, no studies about adults with dyslexia are available; and it is possible that the consistency of the orthographic system favours the reading fluency. The aim of this study was to get an insight of the reading characteristics of Spanish adults with dyslexia and also to infer the reading strategies that they are using. For that purpose, a group of 30 dyslexics (M age = 32 years old) and an age-matched group of 30 adults without reading disabilities completed several phonological and reading tasks: phonological awareness tasks, rapid automatic naming, lexical decision, word and pseudoword reading, letter detection and text reading. The results showed that highly educated Spanish dyslexics performed significantly worse than the control group in the majority of the tasks. Specifically, they showed difficulties reading long pseudowords, indicating problems in automating the grapheme–phoneme rules, but they also seem to present difficulties reading words, which indicate problems with the lexical route. It seems that the Spanish dyslexic adults, as in deep orthographies, continue having difficulties in phonological awareness tasks, rapid naming and reading."

The hypotheses included: (a) own-name advantage , which states that children learn those letters earlier which occur in their own names, (b) the letter-order hypothesis , which states that letters occurring earlier in the alphabet string are learned before letters occurring later in the alphabet string, (c) the letter-name pronunciation effect , which states that children learn earlier those alphabet letters for which the name of the letter is in the letter's pronunciation, and (d) the consonant-order hypothesis , which states that children learn earlier those letters for which corresponding consonantal phonemes are learned early in phonological development. Participants were 339 four-year-old children attending public preschool classrooms serving primarily low-income children. Children's knowledge of each of the 26 alphabet letters was assessed, and these data were tested for the four hypotheses using a linear logistic test model (LLTM). Results from the LLTM confirmed all four hypotheses to show that the order of letter learning is not random, in that some letters hold an advantage over other letters to influence their order of learning.

Data used in the study were compiled from the 27 individual studies comprising the Cooperative Research Program in First-Grade Reading Instruction relevant to three basic questions: (1) To what extent are various pupil, teacher, class, school, and community characteristics related to pupil achievement in first-grade reading and spelling? (2) Which of the many approaches to initial reading instruction produces superior reading and spelling achievement at the end of the first grade? (3) Is any program uniquely effective or ineffective for pupils with high or low readiness for reading? The instructional approaches evaluated included Basal, Basal plus Phonics, i.t.a., Linguistic, Language Experience, and Phonic/Linguistic. Identical information was gathered in each project concerning teacher, school, and community characteristics and common experimental guidelines were followed in all 27 studies. Results of the correlation analysis revealed that the ability to recognize letters of the alphabet prior to the beginning of reading instruction was the single best predictor of first-grade reading achievement. The analysis of methodology indicated that the various nonbasal instructional programs tended to be superior to basal programs as measured by word recognition skills of pupils after 1 year of reading instruction. Differences between basal and nonbasal programs were less consistent when measures of comprehension, spelling, rate of accuracy of reading, and word study skills constituted the criterion of reading achievement. The analysis of treatments according to level of readiness for reading revealed that no method was especially effective or ineffective for pupils of high or low readiness as measured by tests of intelligence, auditory discrimination, and letter knowledge.

PRESENTE EL INFORME del Centro Coordinador del Programa Cooperativo de Investigacion de la Ensenanza de Lectura en Primer Grado. Los datos usados en el Estudio, fueron recopilados de 27 estudios individuales que comprendia el Programa Cooperativo de Investigacion de la Ensenanza de Lectura en Primer Grado, relevantes para tres presuntas basicas: (1) ?Hasta que punto estan relacionadas las diversas caracteristicas de alumnos, profesores, clases, ecuelas y comunidad con las realizaciones obtenidas en lectura y delectreo entre alumnos del primer grado? (2) ?De los muchos enfogues utilizados en la ensenanza de lectura inicial, cual produce mayor rendimiento en la habilidad para leer y deletrear al terminar el primer grado? (3) ?Es algun programa singularmente eficaz o ineficaz para alumnos con un alto o bajo grado de aptitud para la lectura? Los metodos de instruccion evaluados incluyeron Basico, Basico Mas Fonico, i.t.a., Linguistico, Experiencia con el Idoma Y Fonico/ Linguistico. En cada proyecto se recopilo informacion identica respecto de las caracteristicas del profesor, la escuela, y la comunidad, y se siguieron las mismas pautas experimentales en los 27 estudios. Los resultados del analisis correlativo revelaron que la habilidad para reconocer las letras del alfabeto, previa a la iniciacion de la ensenanza de lectura, era el unico y mejor indicador para predecir las realizaciones en lectura en el primer grado. El analisis de la metodologia indico que los diversos programas nobasicos de ensenanza tendian a ser superiores a los programas basicos, medidos en terminas de habilidades de los estudiantes para reconocer palabras despues de un ano de ensenanza de lectura. La diferencia entre programas basicos y no-basicos era menos consistente cuando medidas de compresion, deletreo, rapidez y exactitud en la lectura, y destreza en el estudio de palabras donstituyeron los criterios para las realizationes en lectura. El analisis de los tratamientos de acuerdo con el nivel de aptitud para la lectura revelo que ningun metodo era particularmente eficaz o ineficas para alumnos de alta o baja aptitud, medida por medio de pruebas de inteligencia, discriminacion auditiva y conocimiento de letras.

Vorgestellt wird ein Bericht des Koordinationszentrums fur das gemeinsame Forschungsprogramm im Erstleseunterricht. Die in dieser Studie verwendeten Daten wurden aus 27 Einzeluntersuchungen zusammengestellt, die gemas der Zusammenarbeit im Forschungsprogramm fur den Erstleseunterricht drei grundlegende Fragen erfassen: 1. Bis zu welchem Ausmas sind die Merkmale von unterschiedlichen Schulern, Lehrern, Klassen, Schulen und Bezirken relevant fur die Leistungen eines Schulers im Erstlese- und Schreibunterricht? 2. Welcher von den vielen Zugangen im Erstleseunterricht ermoglicht bessere Lese- und Schreibleistungen am Ende der ersten Schulstufe? 3. Gibt es irgendein Programm, das eindeutig effektiv oder ineffektiv ist fur Kinder mit hoher oder niedriger Lesemotivation? Die Lehrmethoden, die evaluiert wurden, umfasten grundlegenden Fibelunterricht, Fibelunterricht und Sprachlehre, das System des Anfangsalphabets (i.t.a.), Sprachlehre, Sprache im Verwendungszusammenhang und Verschriftung. In jedem Projectbereich wurden identische Informationen zu den einzelnen Merkmalen gesammelt, betreffend den Lehrer, die Schule und den Bezirk. Allgemeine Forschungsrichtlinien wurden in allen 27 Studien beachtet. Die Ergebnisse der aufeinander bezogenen Analysen zeigten, das die Fahigkeit, Buchstaben des Alphabets noch vor dem Leseunterricht zu erkennen, als beste singulare Vorhersage fur die Leistungen von Erstlesern bezeichnet werden kann. Eine Analyse der Unterrichtsmethoden zeigten, das unterschiedliche, nicht fibelorientierte Lehrprogramme eher besser waren als fibelorientierte Grundlagenprogramme, bezogen auf die Messung der Schulerleistungen im Bereich der Worterkennung nach einem Jahr Leseunterricht. Unterschiede zwischen fibelorientierten und nicht fibelorientierten Programmen waren weniger starr, wen Sinnverstandnis, Buchstabierfahigkeit, Lesegenauigkeit und Wortaufbau- wie Wortabbauubungen als Kriterien der Leseleistung genommen wurden. Die Analyse der Unterweisungen entsprechend dem Bereitschaftslevel furs Lesen ergab, das sich keine Methode als besonder effektiv oder ineffectiv fur Schuler mit hoher oder niedriger Lesemotivation erwies, wie anhand von Intelligenztests, von Hortests und Buchstabentests festgestellt wurde. Dieser Forschungsbericht wurde durchgefuhrt gemas einem Vertrag mit dem U.S. Ministerium fur Gesundheit, Erziehung und Wohlfahrt, dem Erziehungsamt und mit Unterstutzung des kooperativen Forschungsprogrammes.

ON Y PRESENTE le rapport du Centre de Coordination du Programme de Recherche Cooperative sur l'Enseignement de la Lecture au niveau primaire. Les donnees utilisees au cours de cette etude ont ete recueillies d'apres les 27 etudes individuelles composant le Programme de Recherche, et concernaient trois problemes de base: (1) A quel point les caracteristiques variees de l'eleve, du professeur, de la classe, de l'ecole, de la communaute sont-elles en relation avec les resultats atteints en lecture et en orthographe par l'eleve de premiere annee? (2) Parmi les nombreuses methodes utilisees pour enseigner la lecture aux debutants, quelle est celle qui donne les meilleurs resultats en lecture et orthographe en fin de premiere annee? (3) Un programme donne est-il entierement efficace ou inefficace pour des eleves dont le degre de facilite en lecture est respectivement eleve ou bas? Parmi les differentes methodes evaluees on comptait les suivantes: Lecture de Base, Lecture de Base plus Phonique, enseignement initial de l'alphabet, Linguistique, Experience du langage, Phonique/Linguistique. Dans chacune des 27 etudes on s'est propose de recueillir le meme genre d'information en ce qui concerne les caracteristiques de professeur, d l'ecole et de la communaute et on a suivi les memes lignes generales d'experience. Les resultats des analyses de correlation ont revele que la capacite de reconnaitre les lettres de l'alphabet avant de commencer l'apprentissage de la lecture etait le meilleur facteur predictif en ce qui concerne les resultats atteints en fin de premiere annee. L'analyse des differentes methodes a indique que les programmes sans lecture de base ont tendance a etre superieurs a ceux utilisant les lectures de base en ce qui concerne la capacite de reconnaitre des mots en fin de premiere annee. Les differences entre ces deux series de programmes sont moins uniformes lorsque comprehension, orthographe, rapidite et exactitude en lecture, et etude des mots constituent les criteres d'accomplissement en lecture. L'analyse des traitements selon le degre de facilite en lecture a revele qu'aucune methode n'est particulierement efficace ou inefficace pour des eleves dont le degre de facilite etait juge respectivement eleve ou faible d'apres des tests d'intelligence, de discernement auditif et de connaissance des lettres."

Visser,"The interest in Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) has grown considerably over the last decade. Nevertheless, its etiology and prognosis are still poorly understood. The idea is growing that DCD may not be a uniform disorder. This review summarizes research on DCD, with a particular focus on subtype and comorbidity studies. The main message of the paper is that, in order to understand the etiology and prognosis of DCD, we need to have a better understanding of its nature. This requires an awareness of the existence of subtypes and comorbidities. Current theories on comorbidity phenomena are discussed in terms of their possible merit for the development of the field. Particular attention is given to the Automatization Deficit Hypothesis, a theory based on research on dyslexia."

Educ Psychol Meas 2001;61:490–504] have begun to use computerized versions of the RAN. Here a slightly modified computerized version of the RAN was created and the equivalency between the computerized RAN and the conventional version was investigated using a university student sample. Naming times on the conventional and computerized RAN were highly correlated, overall, and for each of the four RAN stimulus types (letters, digit, colors, objects). Conventional and computerized RAN times predicted reading rate and reading comprehension scores equally well and both showed very high test–retest reliability. With our university studen t sample, findings indicate equivalency between the two testing mediums in all areas examined. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Two components of speed of lexical access were studied: phonological and semantic. Previous studies have mainly investigated these components of lexical access separately. The present study examined both components in naming tasks—with isolated letters (phonological) and pictures (semantic). Seventy-five Grade 5 students were administered measures of letter and picture naming speed, word and nonword reading fluency, and reading comprehension, together with control measures of vocabulary. The results showed that letter naming was a unique predictor of word reading fluency, whereas picture naming was not. Conversely, picture naming speed contributed unique variance to reading comprehension, whereas letter naming did not. The results indicate that phonological and semantic lexical access speed are separable components that are important for different reading subskills."

Three-way mixed ANOVAS revealed the following effects and interactions. In terms of grade effect, grade 1 students performed significantly better than primary students on phoneme and onset-rime tasks. A stimulus language effect was observed for the three levels of phonological awareness. All children performed better on English tasks than on French ones. Interaction effects of stimulus language by program were revealed for phoneme as well as syllable tasks. Posthoc analyses revealed that French students performed better on English phoneme and syllable tasks than on French, while English students performed better than French immersion students on French syllable tasks. Correlational analyses revealed significant relationships between reading and phoneme and onset-rime phonological awareness tasks regardless of program of instruction (English, French immersion) or language of reading test (English, French). Syllable awareness was only significantly correlated with the French non-word reading task for the French immersion students."

Wagner, Joseph K. Torgesen, Carol A.

These abilities are characterized by different developmental rates and remarkably stable individual differences. Decoding did not exert a causal influence on subsequent phonological processing abilities, but letter-name knowledge did. Causal relations between phonological processing abilities and reading-related knowledge are bidirectional: Phonological processing abilities exert strong causal influences on word decoding; letter-name knowledge exerts a more modest causal influence on subsequent phonological processing abilities. In the context of beginning reading, phonological processing refers to making use of the phonological or sound structure of oral language when learning how to decode written language (see Adams, 1990; Brady & Shankweiler, 1991; Crowder &"

Bosman, Ludo Verhoeven","Abstract The present study investigated active grapheme knowledge and early spelling of 59 first grade children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Speed , nature , and knowledge transfer of spelling acquisition were taken into account. Four orthographic characteristics that influence early spelling, namely, ‘Type of Grapheme’, ‘Grapheme Position’, ‘Number of Graphemes’, and ‘Word Structure’ were examined at the middle and at the end of first grade. At the beginning of first grade when children were between 71 and 97 months, they performed well below national norms on assessment of active grapheme knowledge. The delay in word spelling persisted, but decreased between the middle and the end of first grade. Despite this delay, the findings suggest that characteristics of early spelling for children with SLI are rather similar to those of children with typical language development. For example, children with SLI represented more graphemes at the end of first grade than at the middle of first grade, found it easier to represent the initial grapheme in words than the final or medial grapheme (Grapheme Position), were more successful spelling shorter than longer words (Number of Graphemes), and spelled words with simple structures (CVC) more accurately than those with complex structures (CVCC and CCVC; Word Structure). Finally, participants demonstrated that they can use known graphemes to spell words, but the transfer between active grapheme knowledge and word spelling was not always stable. Learning outcomes: As a result of this activity, readers will be able to explain the speed and the nature of spelling acquisition of children with SLI. As a result of this activity, readers will be able to explain what skills are most important for teachers to practice with children with SLI to improve the spelling skills of these children."

Comparing the end-of-year reading achievement scores for the 57 children who received the language intervention with those of the 59 children in the comparison group, the findings from this research are supportive of both hypotheses.

Speech disorders are identified when a person's voice, fluency, or articulation call attention to the speaker because his or her speech is sufficiently different from the norm. Speech and language development should be consistent with a child's overall development and can be tracked using typical milestone markers. Differential diagnosis is critical to designing appropriate intervention, which should be tailored to the parents' goals along with the child's clinical and educational needs. Early identification and intervention assist in educational planning and are often associated with better long-term outcomes. Any speech-language therapy plan should be designed with measurable goals and consistent monitoring of progress toward those goals."

The analysis focused on the social domains mediated by print as well as the linguistic unit and complexity of discourse text read and/or written by the participants in the homes. The analysis also examined relationships between the types and frequencies of literacy events and the emergent literacy knowledges held by the focal children. Results revealed a description of literacy practice and literacy learning which included great variability in type and frequency of literacy events across the 20 homes. The results also suggested the following patterns of relationships between home literacy practices and emergent literacy knowledge: (a) children's understanding of the intentionality of print is related to both the frequency of literacy events in the home and to their personal focus and involvement in the literacy events, (b) children knew more about the alphabetic principle and the specific forms of written language more in homes where literate members read and wrote at more complex levels of discourse for their own entertainment and leisure, and (c) parents' intentional involvement in their children's literacy learning was higher when their children began formal literacy instruction in school. Reflections on literacy as cultural practice and the ways in which school and home learning can build upon each other are discussed.

El analisis puso el acento en los dominios sociales mediatizados por la escritura, asi como en el tipo de unidad linguistica y la complejidad discursiva de los textos leidos y/o escritos por los participantes en los hogares. El analisis tambien examino las relaciones entre los tipos y frecuencia de los eventos de alfabetizacion y los conocimientos emergentes sobre la lectoescritura de los ninos del estudio. Los resultados revelaron una descripcion de las practicas de alfabetizacion y el aprendizaje de la lectoescritura que incluia una gran variacion en el tipo y la frecuencia de los eventos en los 20 hogares. Los resultados tambien sugirieron los siguientes patrones de relaciones entre las practicas de alfabetizacion en el hogar y los conocimientos emergentes sobre la lectoescritura: (a) la comprension por parte de los ninos de la intencionalidad de la escritura esta relacionada con la frecuencia de los eventos de alfabetizacion en el hogar y con sus intereses personales y compromiso con dichos eventos, (b) los ninos que sabian mas acerca del principio alfabetico y las formas especificas del lenguaje escrito pertenecian a hogares en los que los miembros alfabetizados leian y escribian en niveles complejos del discurso y con propositos de entretenimento y placer y (c) el compromiso intencional de los padres con los aprendizajes de sus hijos era mas alto cuando los ninos comenzaban el aprendizaje formal en la escuela. Se discuten reflexiones sobre la alfabetizacion como practica cultural y las formas en que el aprendizaje en la escuela y el hogar pueden enriquecerse mutuamente.

DIESE BESCHREIBENDE Studie dokumentiert Umfang und Haufigkeit von Lese- und Schreibpraktiken in 20 Familien mit niedrigem sozialokonomischen Status im Zeitraum einer ganzen Woche, wobei die daraus hervorgehenden Kenntnisse im Lesen und Schreiben an 24 Kindern im Alter von vier bis sechs Jahren gemessen wurden. Die Analyse konzentrierte sich auf die sozialen Interaktionen, die eingeleitet wurden durch gedruckte wie gesprochene Einheiten, und auf den Umfang von Gesprachen uber einen von den Teilnehmern gelesenen und/oder geschriebenen Text. Die Analyse untersuchte auch die Zusammenhange zwischen den Textsorten und der Haufigkeit von literarisierenden Erlebnissen und den daraus sich ergebenden Fahigkeiten, die sich die Zielgruppe aneignete. Die Ergebnisse erbrachten einen Zusammenhang zwischen den Tatigkeiten der Lese- und Schreibpraxis und dem Lesenlernen, wobei eine grose Bandbreite an Formen und in der Haufigkeit von Lese- wie Schreibanlassen in den 20 Familien sichtbar wurde. Die Ergebnisse legen die folgenden Beziehungsmuster in der vorschulischen Literarisierung und den sich daraus ergebenden Fahigkeiten nahe: a) Das Verstandnis der Kinder fur die Botschaft von etwas Gedrucktem hangt zusammen mit der Haufigkeit von Textangeboten in der Familie, mit dem personlichen Interesse wie mit dem personlichen Beteiligungsgrad an dem literarisierenden Ereignis. b) Kinder wusten eher Bescheid uber alphabetische Prinzipien und die spezifischen Formen der geschriebenen Sprache in solchen Familien, deren alphabetisierte Mitglieder sich einer hoheren, komplexeren Sprachebene beim Lesen und Schreiben zu ihrer Unterhaltung und zur Entspannung bedienten. c) Das Interesse der Eltern an der Literarisierung ihrer Kinder war groser zu dem Zeitpunkt, als ihre Kinder in der Schule offiziell lesen und schreiben lernten. Besprochen werden Uberlegungen hinsichtlich der Literarisierung als einer Kulturtechnik und hinsichtlich der Moglichkeiten, inwiefern familiare und schulische Lese- und Schreiblernprozesse aufeinander aufbauen konnen."

Poldrack","The majority of children and adults with reading disabilities exhibit pronounced difficulties on naming-speed measures such as tests of rapid automatized naming (RAN). RAN tasks require speeded naming of serially presented stimuli and share key characteristics with reading, but different versions of the RAN task vary in their sensitivity: The RAN letters task successfully predicts reading ability, whereas the RAN objects task does not reliably predict reading after kindergarten. In this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the neural substrates that may underlie performance on these tasks. In two scans during the same test session, adult, average readers covertly rapidly named objects or letters or passively viewed a fixation matrix of plus signs. For both rapid naming tasks compared with fixation, activation was found in neural areas associated with eye movement control and attention as well as in a network of structures previously implicated in reading tasks.

The subjects were children aged 8 to 10 years (N= 110) who were separated into 2 groups on the basis of whether their reading scores were normal or poor. As predicted by many earlier studies, children with poor reading scores demonstrate poor abilities on tests of phonological awareness, as well as on 2 other language tasks that depend on phonological processing. Two specific tests of the temporal processing hypothesis were conducted. Children in both groups were tested (a) on their abilities to recall sequences of nonspeech tones presented at various rates and (b) on their abilities to make phonetic decisions using brief and transitional properties of the speech signal, especially formant transitions (the purported trouble spot in the speech signal for children with phonological processing problems). The children with poor phonological processing abilities showed no special difficulty recalling rapidly presented nonspeech stimuli, and, in their phonetic decisions, they were able to use brief and transitional signal properties, including formant transitions, at least as well as other children. Therefore, no evidence was found to support the hypothesis that temporal processing deficits cause phonological processing problems."

Snowling, Ian Walker","Two groups of adolescents with a childhood history of language impairment were compared with a group of developmentally dyslexic young people of the same age and nonverbal ability. The study also included two comparison groups of typically developing children, one of the same age as those in the clinical groups, and a younger comparison group of similar reading level to the dyslexic students. Tests of spoken and written language skills revealed that the adolescents with dyslexia were indistinguishable from those with resolved language impairments on spoken language tasks, and both groups performed at age-expected levels. However, both dyslexic readers and those with resolved specific language impairments showed deficits in phonological awareness. On written language tasks, a different pattern of performance was apparent. In reading and spelling, adolescents with dyslexia performed only as well as those with persistent oral language impairments and younger controls. However, their reading comprehension was better. The theoretical and educational implications of these findings are discussed."

Three hundred grade three children were assessed on letter, word, and sentence reading, and word writing abilities. Mothers/female guardians responded to a questionnaire-based interview about the home environment. The results show that performance in reading and writing measures was at a level slightly above 50% of the maximum score. Dispersion between the scores was large. There was no significant gender difference in performance, although the boys performed slightly higher than the girls. Correlation analysis showed moderate to high relationship between reading and writing measures and home environment variables. Multiple regression analysis procedure identified four predictors of a summary score of reading and writing ability. These are fathers’ education, the quality of house wall material, number of books for school subjects found in the home, and parental involvement in the child’s school learning. The home environment variables accounted for a rather large variance (31%) in reading and writing ability. Fathers’ education accounted for 16% of the variance and the other variables added 15% of the variance. A specific analysis revealed significant effect of father’s education, construction material for the house walls and books, but not of parental involvement, on separate reading measures (letter, word and sentence reading). Conversely, in terms of children’s ability to write, parental involvement was the only significant predictor. Possible explanations are discussed. The identified variables confirmed the significant role the home environment plays in children’s ability to read and write. The variables are important to consider for research as well as for government and policy decisions when planning to improve the home environment as well as children’s school learning and the development of literacy skills at least in contexts which have similarities with this study."

Various child and family characteristics have been identified as important predictors of children’s linguistic abilities, such as intelligence or the “home literacy environment” (HLE). Therefore, one way to improve children’s competencies is by enhancing the HLE they live in. Family literacy programs have proven to be successful with this task. However, most interventions used to improve HLE were fairly intensive and costly. In this study a nonintensive intervention procedure was developed to improve both, HLE and linguistic competencies. The sample consisted of 125 German children in their last year of kindergarten (mean child age at the beginning of the study: 5 years, 5 months) and their families who showed an above average socio-economic status. All parents were offered to participate in the intervention, consisting of providing them with relevant information on HLE at one evening meeting and providing an additional individual reading session that introduced them to the concept of dialogic reading. HLE and children’s linguistic competencies were assessed before and after the intervention. Participating and non-participating families did not differ in any of the study variables at the beginning of the study. However, families who participated in the interventions not only improved their HLE, but children in those families also showed greater linguistic competency development when compared with the non-participating group. The results indicate that less intensive interventions can have an impact on home learning environments and children’s linguistic development."

Risk children displayed performance profiles resembling those of older children with reading disability. Each group received intensive instruction in phonemic awareness and structured book reading. Instructed risk children made somewhat smaller gains than the nonrisk and required more teaching sessions to reach criterion. Rhyme and phoneme awareness predicted instruction outcome levels, and vocabulary and verbal short-term memory predicted number of teaching sessions to criterion. In kindergarten, the nonrisk group outperformed the risk group on reading and spelling, although the risk group reached grade-appropriate levels. At-risk children can be helped by appropriate preschool instruction, but they require more sustained teaching than nonrisk preschoolers."

Therefore it is important to identify precursor variables which predict these abilities early in order to identify children possibly at risk of developing reading or spelling difficulties. Relevant precursors include letter knowledge, phonological awareness (PA), vocabulary, and cognitive abilities. Moreover, also social aspects such as the socioeconomic status of the family (SES), the migration background and the “Home Literacy Environment” (HLE) are of importance. So far, only a few studies are available which analyse the early development of different possible explanatory factors simultaneously in the years before and after school enrolment. In particular, the relative impact of HLE on early and later linguistic competencies in a German context remains unclear. Thus, in our longitudinal study, covering the period from kindergarten to Grade 1, we focused on the role HLE plays in the development of language competencies of 921 German children, compared to the impact of several other important variables. The results highlight the importance of HLE for the development of linguistic competencies also for a German context. HLE was not only a good predictor of early vocabulary and PA, but additionally directly influenced PA at the beginning of primary school. Moreover, HLE acted as a mediator between SES and migration background on the one hand and the precursors on the other hand. This finding indicates that research and policy should focus more on the learning environments in families to improve children’s achievement."

Student performance on the three RAN subtests were audiotaped and subjected to postacquisition processing to distinguish articulation and interarticulation pause times. This study investigated (1) the relations between the articulation and pause durations associated with the 50 stimuli of each RAN subtest and (2) the relations between the pause and articulation latencies of the three RAN subtests and reading. For both first- and second-grade students, pause and articulation times for RAN letters and objects were not found to be reliably related, in contrast to RAN numbers articulation and pause durations. RAN subtest pause durations were differentially related to reading; however, articulation was rarely related to reading. The RAN letters pause time was the most robust predictor of decoding and reading comprehension, consistently predicting all first- and second-grade measures. Analysis supported the view that reading is predicted by speed of processing associated with letters, not general processing speed."

Lewis, Allison A. Avrich, Lisa A. Freebairn, Amy J. Hansen, Lara Sucheston, Iris Kuo, H. Gerry Taylor, Sudha K. Iyengar, Catherine M. Stein","Speech sound disorders (SSD) present in early childhood, with an estimated 16% of children affected at 3 years of age (Campbell et al., 2003) and with 3.8% of these children continuing to present with speech delay at 6 years of age (Shriberg, Tomblin, & McSweeney, 1999). Language impairment (LI) often co-occurs with SSD, with an estimated 6%–21% comorbidity for receptive language deficits and 38%–62% for children with expressive language disorders (Shriberg & Austin, 1998). Although SSD and/or LI may resolve by early school age, more than half of these children encounter later academic difficulties in language, reading, and spelling (Aram & Hall, 1989; Bishop & Adams, 1990; Flax et al., 2003; Lewis, Freebairn, & Taylor 2000; Shriberg & Austin, 1998).

In a comprehensive review of the comorbidity of SSD, LI, and reading disorder (RD), Pennington and Bishop (2009) concluded that although there is evidence for overlap of these disorders on both the cognitive and etiological levels, the disorders are complex, with subtypes representing all combinations and varying severity of disorders. Recent studies have suggested a genetic etiological overlap and have linked candidate chromosome regions to specific cognitive processes or endophenotypes such as phonological memory, phonological awareness, vocabulary, and processing speed (Miscimarra et al., 2007; Smith, Pennington, Boada, & Shriberg, 2005; Stein et al., 2004, 2006). These endophenotypes may underlie both early SSD and LI and later RD, spelling disorders, and written expression disorders, thus accounting for the high comorbidity of these disorders."

Eicher, Catherine M. Stein, F. Deng, A. A. Ciesla, Natalie R. Powers, Richard Boada, Shelley D. Smith, Bruce F. Pennington, Sudha K. Iyengar, Barbara A. Lewis, Jeffrey R. Gruen","A major milestone of child development is the acquisition and use of speech and language. Communication disorders, including speech sound disorder (SSD), can impair a child's academic, social and behavioral development. Speech sound disorder is a complex, polygenic trait with a substantial genetic component. However, specific genes that contribute to SSD remain largely unknown. To identify associated genes, we assessed the association of the DYX2 dyslexia risk locus and markers in neurochemical signaling genes (e.g., nicotinic and dopaminergic) with SSD and related endophenotypes. We first performed separate primary associations in two independent samples – Cleveland SSD (210 affected and 257 unaffected individuals in 127 families) and Denver SSD (113 affected individuals and 106 unaffected individuals in 85 families) – and then combined results by meta-analysis. DYX2 markers, specifically those in the 3′ untranslated region of DCDC2 (P = 1.43 × 10−4), showed the strongest associations with phonological awareness. We also observed suggestive associations of dopaminergic-related genes ANKK1 (P = 1.02 × 10−2) and DRD2 (P = 9.22 × 10−3) and nicotinic-related genes CHRNA3 (P = 2.51 × 10−3) and BDNF (P = 8.14 × 10−3) with case–control status and articulation. Our results further implicate variation in putative regulatory regions in the DYX2 locus, particularly in DCDC2, influencing language and cognitive traits. The results also support previous studies implicating variation in dopaminergic and nicotinic neural signaling influencing human communication and cognitive development. Our findings expand the literature showing genetic factors (e.g., DYX2) contributing to multiple related, yet distinct neurocognitive domains (e.g., dyslexia, language impairment, and SSD). How these factors interactively yield different neurocognitive and language-related outcomes remains to be elucidated."

Parents reported on the home literacy environment via questionnaires and a children's book title checklist, adapted for an Indian sample. Parents' book-reading practices moderated the role of English in the home in predicting children's English receptive vocabulary, such that high levels of book reading compensated for low ambient levels of English in the home.

Fifteen university students were assessed on RAN digits, letters, and objects using functional mag- netic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results showed a common neural pattern that included regions related to motor planning (e.g., cerebellum), semantic access (middle temporal gyrus), articulation (supplementary motor association, motor/pre-motor, anterior cingulate cortex), and grapheme-phoneme mapping (ven- tral supramarginal gyrus). However, RAN digits and letters showed many unique regions of activation over and above RAN objects particularly in semantic and articulatory regions, including precuneus, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, nucleus accumbens and thalamus. The only region unique to RAN objects included bilateral fusiform, a region commonly implicated in object processing. Overall, our results provide the first neural evidence for a stronger relationship between RAN letters and digits than when either task is compared to RAN objects."

In this study, we found evidence of the importance of spoken phonology in the letter–sound learning of 89 deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH) preschoolers. Only DHH children with at least some ability to perceive speech were included in the study. DHH children were more likely to know letter sounds for which the corresponding letter name contains a phonological cue (e.g., d as opposed to h), a phenomenon robustly observed in hearing children (e.g., Treiman, Weatherston, & Berch, 1994). However, unlike the pattern observed in hearing children, DHH children benefited more from phonological cues that are at the end of letter names (e.g., m) rather than the beginning (e.g., b). DHH children’s letter-sound knowledge was strongly associated with phonological awareness—and phoneme-level skills in particular. Despite less differentiated phonological representations, DHH children seem to rely on similar processes to hearing children as they begin to acquire the alphabetic principle, with spoken phonology playing an important role."

The participants were 392 primarily Latino immigrant (85%) families and their children. Mothers completed questionnaires about their families and their home literacy environment (HLE), and children's emergent literacy skills were measured in English and Spanish at the outset of the preschool year. Project assistants interviewed mothers in their homes and tallied the presence of literacy-related materials. Results of structural equation modeling showed that the 3 preliteracy skills were significantly associated within and across English and Spanish, suggesting the possible transfer of these early preliteracy skills across languages. For the English language HLE, parents' literacy-related behaviors, sibling-child reading, and families' literacy resources were all associated with children's English oral language skills, and their English print knowledge was associated with their home resources. For the Spanish language HLE, only parents' literacy-related behaviors were related to children's Spanish oral language and print knowledge skills. There were no significant cross-linguistic relations between any aspect of the English HLE and children's Spanish preliteracy skills, whereas parents' literacy-related behaviors in Spanish were negatively associated with children's English oral language and phonological awareness skills. Given the importance of oral language and vocabulary in promoting children's literacy, these results indicate that parents can support this skill in both languages, but their relative impact seems to be within rather across language.

Bingham,"This study examined the relation among mothers' literacy-related beliefs, the home literacy environment, the quality of mother–child book-reading interactions, and children's development of early literacy skills. The participants of this study were 60 mothers and their 4-year-old children. After controlling for mothers' educational attainment, mothers' literacy beliefs were positively related to the quality of home literacy environments and the instructional and affective quality of joint book-reading interactions. The quality of children's home literacy environments and mother–child joint book-reading interactions was related to children's development of early literacy skills. Findings are discussed in relation to the importance of understanding the connection between parents' literacy beliefs and behaviors in designing effective literacy interventions and creating school and family literacy connections."

Cluster analysis of the Q‐sort responses revealed four instructional approaches that differed in their focus on literacy skills, social development and self‐esteem. In addition, measures of emergent literacy skills, classroom behaviour and peer relationships were obtained for 162 low‐income children attending these kindergarten classrooms. Children in classrooms emphasising emergent literacy skills demonstrated greater mastery of such skills than did children in classrooms emphasising social development. Moreover, literacy skill‐focused teachers also reported fewer disruptive behaviour and peer problems among these children.

Steacy, John R. Kirby, Rauno Parrila, Donald L. Compton","The Double Deficit Hypothesis of dyslexia is one approach to classifying students with reading disabilities. The theory offers four distinct groups of readers: (a) average readers, (b) students with phonological deficits, (c) students with naming speed deficits, and (d) students with double deficits: those having both (b) and (c). This study examines the stability of these groups from kindergarten to second grade. An initial sample of 214 students were tested at four time points on measures of rapid automatized naming, phonological awareness, and reading. Latent transition analyses were used to examine the stability of these groups over time. These analyses indicated moderate stability from kindergarten to second grade with the probability of movement between groups being higher in kindergarten and early first grade. The groups differed in reading achievement at each testing time, with the double deficit group obtaining the lowest scores. Implications for early assessment and intervention are discussed."

Despite the application of advanced genetic and molecular biological technologies, the genetic bases of the human behavioral traits and psychiatric diseases remains largely unresolved. Conventional genetic linkage approaches have not yielded definitive results, possibly because of the absence of objective diagnostic tests, the complex nature of human behavior or the incomplete penetrance of psychiatric traits. However, recent studies have revealed some genes of interest using multifaceted approaches to overcome these challenges. The approaches include using families in which specific behaviors segregate as a mendelian trait, utilization of endophenotypes as biological intermediate traits, identification of psychiatric disease phenotypes in genomic disorders, and the establishment of mouse models."

Longitudinal data were obtained for 1436 Finnish children (5- to 6-year-olds at baseline) and their mothers and fathers. 684 girls and 752 boys participating in the study represented four Finnish municipalities. The reading skills of the children were measured four times: at the beginning and at the end of their kindergarten year, and at the beginning and at the end of Grade 1. In kindergarten, decoding tests were administered individually. In Grade 1, group tests in reading fluency were performed. The children's mothers and fathers filled in questionnaires on the frequency of their teaching of reading and the frequency of shared reading with their children in the kindergarten year and in Grade 1. The results showed that the better word reading skills children showed in kindergarten, the more shared reading parents reported. Also, the better word reading skills boys evidenced in kindergarten, the more teaching of reading parents reported. However, in Grade 1, it was children's poor skills in reading that activated more frequent parents’ teaching of reading and more frequent shared reading."

Ballantyne, Jeanne Townsend","Pre-linguistic sensory deficits, especially in “temporal” processing, have been implicated in developmental Language Impairment (LI). However, recent evidence has been equivocal with data suggesting problems in the spectral domain. The present study examined event-related potential (ERP) measures of auditory sensory temporal and spectral processing, and their interaction, in typical children and those with LI (7–17 years; n=25 per group). The stimuli were 3 CV syllables and 3 consonant-to-vowel transitions (spectral sweeps) isolated from the syllables. Each of these 6 stimuli appeared in 3 durations (transitions: 20, 50, and 80 ms; syllables: 120, 150, and 180 ms). Behaviorally, the group with LIs showed inferior syllable discrimination both with long and short stimuli. In ERPs, trends were observed in the group with LI for diminished long-latency negativities (the N2-N4 peaks) and a developmentally transient enhancement of the P2 peak. Some, but not all, ERP indices of spectral processing also showed trends to be diminished in the group with LI specifically in responses to syllables. Importantly, measures of the transition N2-N4 peaks correlated with expressive language abilities in the LI children. None of the group differences depended on stimulus duration. Therefore, sound brevity did not account for the diminished spectral resolution in these LI children. Rather, the results suggest a deficit in acoustic feature integration at higher levels of auditory sensory processing. The observed maturational trajectory suggests a non-linear developmental deviance rather than simple delay."

M.

Both deficits have been proposed as phenotypic markers of heritable language impairment. We studied 173 twin pairs, selected to be over-representative of children with risk of developmental language impairment, using a battery of standardized language and intelligence tests, a test of nonword repetition to index phonological STM and two elicitation tasks to assess use of verb tense marking. As predicted, the phonological STM and the verb tense measures both discriminated children with risk of language impairment from low risk children, and DeFries–Fulker analysis showed that impairments on both tasks were significantly heritable. However, there was minimal phenotypic and etiological overlap between the two deficits, suggesting that different genes are implicated in causing these two kinds of language difficulty. From an evolutionary perspective, these data are consistent with the view that language is a complex function that depends on multiple underlying skills with distinct genetic origins."

Durgunoglu,"One of the challenges for educators working in multilingual settings has been to identify the causes of reading difficulties of language learners (LLs). It is difficult to distinguish between reading problems stemming from low levels of linguistic proficiency versus more general reading/learning difficulties. There is now growing research evidence of cross-language transfer in different literacy processes. Literacy components that reflect language-independent, metacognitive/metalinguistic processes show similarities across the two languages of students. Some examples are phonological awareness, syntactic awareness, knowledge of genres and meaning-making strategies. A possible way to use cross-language transfer as a diagnostic tool is proposed. If children have had enough exposure to and possibly instruction in their first language (L1), we can assess their skills and insights in L1. For LLs who have these skills and insights in their strong L1, we can expect transfer to their second language (L2). If they do not have these skills and insights in their L2 yet, it indicates a delay due to limited language proficiency, and not because of a disability. This way LLs who just need more L2 practice and exposure can be distinguished from those LLs who truly have special needs."
976,2073964316,developing early literacy skills a meta analysis of alphabet learning and instruction,2010,10.1598/RRQ.45.1.2,Reading Research Quarterly,"Shayne B. Piasta, Richard K. Wagner","In the field of early literacy, alphabet knowledge refers to children’s familiarity with letter forms, names, and corresponding sounds, as measured by recognition, production, and writing tasks. Together, such alphabet knowledge represents an important component of emergent literacy (Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). Children’s knowledge of letter names and sounds is the best predictor of their later reading and spelling abilities (Hammill, 2004; Scarborough, 1998; Schatschneider, Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, & Foorman, 2004). Letter name and letter sound knowledge predict subsequent literacy skills independently of other important predictors including phonological awareness and oral language (Burgess & Lonigan, 1998; McBride-Chang, 1999; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994). Preschool and kindergarten students with poor knowledge of letter names and sounds are more likely to struggle with learning to read and be classified as having reading disabilities (Gallagher, Frith, & Snowling, 2000; O’Connor & Jenkins, 1999; Torppa, Poikkeus, Laakso, Eklund, & Lyytinen, 2006). These children tend to fall further behind their peers in reading acquisition, leading to gaps in spelling, reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension skills (Stanovich, 1986; Torgesen, 2002).

For these reasons, alphabet knowledge has become an important learning goal for young children. The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) recognizes development of the alphabetic principle as a goal for the preschool years and proficiency in letter discrimination, letter naming, and letter–sound correspondences are expected during the kindergarten year (NAEYC, 1998). Standards for Head Start (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services & Administration for Children and Families, 2003) require children to demonstrate awareness of letters as individual symbols and the capability to identify at least 10 letters by name. Both the Early Reading First and Reading First programs set explicit goals for increasing letter knowledge and letter–sound correspondences (U.S. Department of Education, 2002; 2003). Finally, many state curriculum frameworks, as required by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, include letter name learning, basic sound knowledge, and letter writing in their literacy standards for prekindergarten and kindergarten students (e.g., Florida Department of Education, n.d.; Massachusetts Department of Education, 2001).

Despite these initiatives, relatively little is known about the impact of early instruction on the development of alphabet knowledge. This fact is especially troublesome as large numbers of children continue to enter kindergarten knowing less than half of the letter names and fewer letter sounds (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services & Administration for Children and Families, 2005, 2006). Approaches to alphabet teaching vary greatly, as there has been disagreement about the appropriateness of early literacy instruction and about what constitutes effective instruction (Bredekamp, 1987; Dickinson, 2002; Elkind & Whitehurst, 2001; Foulin, 2005; Justice, Pence, Bowles, & Wiggins, 2006). The present study synthesized the research literature on the effects of alphabet instruction on both alphabet knowledge and other emergent literacy outcomes. We examined potential moderators of these effects, including factors related to sample and instructional characteristics. We also examined whether effect sizes were affected by publication bias or methodological issues related to study quality."

Bindman, Lori E. Skibbe, Annemarie H. Hindman, Dorit Aram, Frederick J. Morrison","Abstract The current study examines the nature and variability of parents’ aid to preschoolers in the context of a shared writing task, as well as the relations between this support and children's literacy, vocabulary, and fine motor skills. In total, 135 preschool children (72 girls) and their parents (primarily mothers) in an ethnically diverse, middle-income community were observed while writing a semi-structured invitation for a pretend birthday party together. Children's phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, word decoding, vocabulary, and fine motor skills were also assessed. Results revealed that parents provided variable, but generally low-level, support for children's approximation of sound-symbol correspondence in their writing (i.e., graphophonemic support), as well as for their production of letter forms (i.e., print support). Parents frequently accepted errors rather than asking for corrections (i.e., demand for precision). Further analysis of the parent–child dyads ( n  = 103) who wrote the child's name on the invitation showed that parents provided higher graphophonemic, but not print, support when writing the child's name than other words. Overall parental graphophonemic support was positively linked to children's decoding and fine motor skills, whereas print support and demand for precision were not related to any of the child outcomes. In sum, this study indicates that while parental support for preschoolers’ writing may be minimal, it is uniquely linked to key literacy-related outcomes in preschool."

From a stratified cluster sample in rural, urban, and suburban areas in the upper midwest, 7,218 children were screened. The language screening failure rate was 26.2%. Children who failed the screening and a similar number of controls were then administered a diagnostic battery (n = 2,084) that provided for a diagnosis of SLI using common diagnostic standards. Results provided an estimated overall prevalence rate of 7.4%. The prevalence estimate for boys was 8% and for girls 6%. Variation in prevalence was found among children of different racial/cultural backgrounds; however, these background variables were found to be correlated with parental education, which was also associated with SLI. The parents of 29% of the children identified as SLI reported they had previously been informed that their child had a speech or language problem.

The prevalence estimates obtained fell within recent estimates for SLI, but demonstrated that this condition is more prevalent among females than has been previously reported. Also, the clinical identification of these children remains low among kindergarteners."

Mixed effects logistic regression models showed that both symbol-level (visual complexity, phonological complexity, frequency) and child-level (phoneme awareness, vocabulary, rapid automatized naming) measures predicted variations in akshara knowledge. Thus predictors of akshara knowledge appear to be related to aspects of both visual and phonological processing.

The speech and language deficits associated with SSD are shared with several other disorders, including dyslexia, autism, Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), and Angelman’s Syndrome (AS), raising the possibility of gene sharing. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that dyslexia and SSD share genetic susceptibility loci. The present study assesses the hypothesis that SSD also shares susceptibility loci with autism and PWS. To test this hypothesis, we examined linkage between SSD phenotypes and microsatellite markers on the chromosome 15q14–21 region, which has been associated with autism, PWS/AS, and dyslexia. Using SSD as the phenotype, we replicated linkage to the 15q14 region (P = 0.004). Further modeling revealed that this locus influenced oral-motor function, articulation and phonological memory, and that linkage at D15S118 was potentially influenced by a parent-of-origin effect (LOD score increase from 0.97 to 2.17, P = 0.0633). These results suggest shared genetic determinants in this chromosomal region for SSD, autism, and PWS/AS."

Wood","Abstract One hundred and fifteen adults with well-documented childhood reading status underwent a series of neuropsychological tests including tests of memory, attention, phonological processing, and visual perceptual skills in an attempt to define the neuropsychological profile of dyslexia in adulthood. Compared to a normal nonreading disabled sample, subjects with a history of reading disability performed consistently poorer on most neuropsychological tests. However, after covarying for intelligence and socioeconomic status, only tests of rapid naming, phonological awareness, and nonword reading were significant discriminating measures. The hypothesis that deficits in phonological processing comprise the core cognitive deficits in adults with a history of reading disability was supported. Independent of current adult reading ability, measures of nonword reading, phonological awareness, and rapid naming serve as indicators of a childhood history of reading disability."

Justice, Erin Redle","Abstract Purpose The purpose of the current study was to describe the current state of practice for writing Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals for children with speech sound disorders (SSDs). Method IEP goals for 146 children receiving services for SSDs within public school systems across two states were coded for their dominant theoretical framework and overall quality. A dichotomous scheme was used for theoretical framework coding: cognitive-linguistic or sensory-motor. Goal quality was determined by examining 7 specific indicators outlined by an empirically tested rating tool. In total, 147 long-term and 490 short-term goals were coded. Results The results revealed no dominant theoretical framework for long-term goals, whereas short-term goals largely reflected a sensory-motor framework. In terms of quality, the majority of speech production goals were functional and generalizable in nature, but were not able to be easily targeted during common daily tasks or by other members of the IEP team. Short-term goals were consistently rated higher in quality domains when compared to long-term goals. Conclusions The current state of practice for writing IEP goals for children with SSDs indicates that theoretical framework may be eclectic in nature and likely written to support the individual needs of children with speech sound disorders. Further investigation is warranted to determine the relations between goal quality and child outcomes. Learning outcomes: (1) Identify two predominant theoretical frameworks and discuss how they apply to IEP goal writing. (2) Discuss quality indicators as they relate to IEP goals for children with speech sound disorders. (3) Discuss the relationship between long-term goals level of quality and related theoretical frameworks. (4) Identify the areas in which business-as-usual IEP goals exhibit strong quality."

Vadasy, Elizabeth A. Sanders, Julia A. Peyton","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of code-oriented supplemental instruction for kindergarten students at risk for reading difficulties. Paraeducators were trained to provide 18 weeks of explicit instruction in phonemic skills and the alphabetic code. Students identified by their teachers meeting study eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to 2 groups: individual supplemental instruction and control. Students were pretested in December, midtested, and posttested in May-June of kindergarten. At posttest, treatment students significantly outperformed controls on measures of reading accuracy, reading efficiency, oral reading fluency, and developmental spelling. Treatment students had significantly higher linear growth rates in phonemic awareness and alphabetic knowledge during the kindergarten treatment. At a 1-year follow-up, significant group differences remained in reading accuracy and efficiency. Ethical challenges of longitudinal intervention research are discussed. Findings have policy implications for making supplemental instruction in critical early reading skills available."

Children with dyslexia and/or specific language impairment were tested using a phoneme deletion task in which stimuli differed orthogonally by sound similarity and neighborhood density. Phonological and lexical factors influenced performance differently across groups. Children with dyslexia appeared to have a more immature and aberrant pattern of phonological and lexical influence (e.g., favoring sparse and similar features). Children with SLI performed less well than children who were typically developing, but followed a similar pattern of performance (e.g., favoring dense and dissimilar features). Collectively, our results point to both quantitative and qualitative differences in lexical organization and phonological representations in children with SLI and in children with dyslexia."

Stanovich,"After years of confusion, the literature on individual differences in reading ability is finally beginning to coalesce around a small set of general conclusions that are endorsed by the vast majority of researchers. The most fundamental is that word decoding ability accounts for a very large proportion of the variance in reading ability at all levels. Variation in word decoding skill is primarily the result of differences in phonological abilities, rather than visual processes. Less-skilled readers are not characterized by a general inability to use context to facilitate word recognition. However, situations where such readers fail to utilize context to facilitate word recognition will arise when their slow and inaccurate decoding of words renders the context useless. Less-skilled readers display performance deficits on a wide variety of short-term memory tasks, probably due to an inability to efficiently employ various memory strategies, and most certainly due to inadequate phonological coding. Less-skilled readers may have comprehension deficits that are partially independent of word decoding skill. These problems probably arise because syntactic abilities and metacognitive strategies are inadequately developed."

Half of these children had a family history of reading problems and were considered at risk for dyslexia; the other half were not at risk. A novel analysis, mixture modeling, revealed four subgroups with differential developmental trajectories to early reading. The subgroups who showed either a ""dysfluent trajectory"" (n = 12; 11 at risk vs. 1 control) or a ""declining trajectory"" (n = 35; 24 vs. 11) contained more children with familial risk for dyslexia. The subgroup showing an ""unexpected trajectory"" contained equal numbers of at-risk and non-risk children (n = 67; 33 vs. 34). The subgroup displaying a ""typical trajectory"" (n = 85, 38 vs. 47) contained more children born without dyslexia risk. This differential development of skills revealed that there are at least three troubled routes along which a child may ultimately encounter difficulties in reading acquisition. The most explicit routes are characterized by problems in either phonological awareness, naming speed, or letter knowledge—problems that increase in severity with age. [End Page 514]"

This paper draws on a study of SOBATAKA implementation for the preschool children who were having dyslexia and very weak performance in mathematics - in recognizing, counting and writing number from 1 to 10. The reasons why SOBATAKA was designed and the process of how SOBATAKA was tested and implemented are explained detail in this paper. To analyze SOBATAKA's effectiveness, a thorough study of problem identification through class observation and parents-teacher interview has been executed. Then, process is followed by performing three types of assessment during the mathematics class; Activity 1- Pulling Forward the Bus while Saying the Ascending Number, Activity 2 - Singing an Ascending Number Song and Activity 3 - Writing Numbers from 1 to 10. From the result analysis, it was found that SOBATAKA was successfully tested and proven can benefit the slow learners at preschool level enhancing their skills of recognizing, counting and writing numbers from 1 to 10 in two weeks' time. The negative behaviors of fear, passive, not motivated, shy and less interest in learning mathematics have been positively changed to be much more daring, courage, active, confident and ambitious after the SOBATAKA's class treatments. Finally, it can be concluded that SOBATAKA is able to enhance the ability of the `slow learners at pre-school level' in learning numbers more effectively, but is also can strengthening their cognitive concept and social skills."

We explored the effect of computer animation of the print in order to draw the child’s attention to each word as it was read. We also investigated the influence of illustrating that not all visual displays are readable print on the child’s print knowledge. The measures of interest were print concept knowledge and early reading skill. Results indicated that simply drawing children’s attention to the print during shared reading was insufficient to facilitate children’s learning of print conventions, but this attention to print while hearing stories read did improve children’s letter reading. The child’s active engagement with the print during shared story reading led to further improvements in written language skills, as illustrated by gains in knowledge about print concepts."

Sixty children were followed from Grade 3 to Grade 5 and were administered RAN (Letters and Digits), phonological processing, lexical and sublexical orthographic processing, speed of processing, reading accuracy, and fluency tasks. Pause time was highly correlated with reading fluency and shared more of its predictive variance with lexical orthographic processing and speed of processing than with phonological processing. Articulation time also predicted reading fluency, and its contribution was mostly independent from other cognitive-processing skills.

We recorded eye movements of German and English children and adults while reading closely matched sentences, each including a target word manipulated for length and frequency. Results showed differential word recognition processes for both developing and skilled readers. Children of the two orthographies did not differ in terms of total word processing time, but this equal outcome was achieved quite differently. Whereas German children relied on small-unit processing early in word recognition, English children applied small-unit decoding only upon rereading—possibly when experiencing difficulties in integrating an unfamiliar word into the sentence context. Rather unexpectedly, cross-linguistic differences were also found in adults in that English adults showed longer processing times than German adults for nonwords. Thus, although orthographic consistency does play a major role in reading development, cross-linguistic differences are detectable even in skilled adult readers."

To investigate this impairment, we manipulated the orthographic and phonological similarity of adjacent letters online as dyslexic and nondyslexic readers named letters in a serial naming (RAN) task. Eye movements and voice onsets were recorded. Letter arrays contained target item pairs in which the second letter was orthographically or phonologically similar to the first letter when viewed either parafoveally (Experiment 1a) or foveally (Experiment 1b). Relative to normal readers, dyslexic readers were more affected by orthographic confusability in Experiment 1a and phonological confusability in Experiment 1b. Normal readers were slower to process orthographically similar letters in Experiment 1b. Findings indicate that the phonological and orthographic processing problems of dyslexic readers manifest differently during parafoveal and foveal processing, with each contributing to slower RAN performance and impaired reading fluency."

We examined patterns of performance in phonological awareness, naming of letters, morphological awareness, and visual-spatial relations, in 5-year-old native speakers of Spanish (n = 43), Hebrew (n = 40), and Cantonese (n = 63) and the relations of these literacy related skills to concurrent word writing and word reading. The writing systems in these languages represent three major categories, i.e., alphabetic (Spanish), abjad (Hebrew), and morphosyllabic (Chinese). Phonological awareness, letter naming, and perception of visual-spatial relations differed across groups, whereas morphological awareness showed a similar level of attainment in all three languages. Stepwise regression analyses explaining writing and reading for each language separately revealed both commonalities and differences between languages. Phonological awareness assessed by initial syllable deletion contributed to writing and to reading in Cantonese and in Spanish. Phonological awareness assessed by final phoneme isolation explained reading in Hebrew, whereas final and initial phoneme isolation explained writing in Hebrew. Letter naming predicted both writing and reading in Spanish and in Hebrew, while perception of visual-spatial relations did so in Cantonese. At age 5, children’s metalinguistic knowledge and visual discrimination abilities are already attuned to the particular features of the writing system to which they are exposed."

Bentler, Albert Satorra","In a recent note in the Teacher's Corner of this journal, de Jong (1999) proposed a method for computing hierarchical or fixed-order regressions in the context of latent variables. The essence of this approach is to decompose the predictor variables in the regression into orthogonal components based on a Cholesky decomposition and to regress the dependent variable on these orthogonal components. The components may be conceived of as phantom factors that do not have their own indicators. Because the idea of sequential entry of predictors in a latent variable regression framework seems generally to be unknown, the approach was developed by de Jong for latent variable regressions. However, it equally can be used for observed variable regression or path models. In this article we show that the phantom factors are unnecessary to achieve the objectives of a hierarchical regression. We give a direct approach that is equivalent to de Jong's approach."

Latency measures were obtained from the naming of regular words, exception words, nonwords and pseudohomophones; as well as button press and verbal lexical decision tasks. Regression analyses supported the hypotheses that RAN-Letters latency reflects SV processing in that its variance is uniquely accounted for by exception word naming latency and button press lexical decision latency, and that RAN-Letter Sounds latency best reflects PD processing in that its variance is uniquely accounted for by pseudohomophone and nonword naming latency. Findings are discussed in light of what the RAN tasks are measuring, implications involving visual word recognition models of reading, and the utility of the new RAN-Letter Sounds task with respect to diagnostic and remediation applications."

Coding of families’ book-related discussion focused on the variety of types of talk that parents used during reading. Results showed that parents focused primarily on the meaning of the story, with little attention to the code of the text. The range of talk techniques that parents used was largely independent of background factors such as child gender, ethnicity, or age, as well as family home language. A wider variety of meaning-related remarks by parents was linked to more advanced language skills among preschoolers. Findings provide a portrait of the nature of shared book reading discussion among American families, a profile of the background factors that are linked to this talk, and a precise account of the unique contributions of this talk to key emergent language and literacy competencies."

In each case, the scores for the LD group were higher indicating less desirable adaptive behavior and more problem behavior in the classroom. Implications of these results are presented as well as recommended use of adaptive-behavior measures for identification and the need to prepare mainstream teachers to deal with maladaptive behaviors in the classroom."

Studies on the social and cultural differences among families indicate that the interaction patterns among parents and children, the amount of literacy events that occur inside the family as well as the values and attitudes towards literacy are mainly responsible for children's later academic achievement. Suggestions are being made on how early childhood setting can build bridges between home and school for achieving the utmost of young children's literacy development."

It is well established that a major cause of these problems lies in poorly specified phonological representations. Many individuals with dyslexia also present impairments in auditory temporal processing and speech perception, but it remains debated whether these more basic perceptual impairments play a role in causing the reading problem. Longitudinal studies may help clarifying this issue by assessing preschool children before they receive reading instruction and by following them up through literacy development. The current longitudinal study shows impairments in auditory frequency modulation (FM) detection, speech perception and phonological awareness in kindergarten and in grade 1 in children who receive a dyslexia diagnosis in grade 3. FM sensitivity and speech-in-noise perception in kindergarten uniquely contribute to growth in reading ability, even after controlling for letter knowledge and phonological awareness. These findings indicate that impairments in auditory processing and speech perception are not merely an epiphenomenon of reading failure. Although no specific directional relations were observed between auditory processing, speech perception and phonological awareness, the highly significant concurrent and predictive correlations between all these variables suggest a reciprocal association and corroborate the evidence for the auditory deficit theory of dyslexia."

Thirty-three preschool children were assessed for vocabulary skills and ability to detect rhyme. Results supported the lexical restructuring theory because expressive vocabulary abilities were correlated with rhyming ability. However, children's ability to detect rhyme was not affected by neighborhood density (i.e., words from dense neighborhoods contain many similar sounding neighbors such as cat, bat, etc.). These findings provide important information for those who serve children at risk for reading failure."

Reading accuracy, rate, and fluency was measured among a sample of 67 children, the majority of whom were very poor readers. Regression analyses revealed that phonological processing tasks predicted reading accuracy and comprehension whereas rapid digit (but not picture) naming predicted reading accuracy and rate. After further controlling reading accuracy, digit naming was still a significant predictor of reading rate. This suggests that rapid alphanumeric naming is a highly specific predictor of reading rate and that rapid digit naming and phonological processing are distinct contributors to different aspects of reading in poor readers."

It is one of the most frequently diagnosed disorders in childhood, representing a major educational and social problem 1 . It is well established that dyslexia is a significantly heritable trait 2 with a neurobiological basis 3 . The etiological mechanisms remain elusive, however, despite being the focus of intensive multidisciplinary research 3 , All attempts to map quantitative-trait loci (QTLs) influencing dyslexia susceptibility have targeted specific chromosomal regions, so that inferences regarding genetic etiology have been made on the basis of very limited information 4 . Here we present the first two complete QTL-based genome-wide scans for this trait, in large samples of families from the United Kingdom and United States. Using single-point analysis, linkage to marker D18S53 was independently identified as being one of the most significant results of the genome in each scan (P≤0.0004 for single word-reading ability in each family sample). Multipoint analysis gave increased evidence of 18p11.2 linkage for single-word reading, yielding top empirical P values of 0.00001 (UK) and 0.0004 (US). Measures related to phonological and orthographic processing also showed linkage at this locus. We replicated linkage to 18p11.2 in a third independent sample of families (from the UK), in which the strongest evidence came from a phoneme-awareness measure (most I significant P value=0.00004). A combined analysis of all UK families confirmed that this newly discovered 18p QTL is probably a general risk factor for dyslexia, influencing several readingrelated processes. This is the first report of QTL-based genome-wide scanning for a human cognitive trait."

If they do not have a distinct cognitive style or strategy, but are merely poor in using sequential (Successive) strategies, then, would the same processes that influence reading performance in the general population determine their performance as well? A sample of 84 Canadian First Nations (FN) children were assessed in word and pseudoword reading, rapid naming speed, and ability to process information using the Planning, Attention, Successive, and Simultaneous (PASS) theory of intelligence. Results confirmed that this sample of children did not exhibit a specific cognitive style. Rather, there was evidence of a weakness in Successive processing only in the subgroup of poor readers.

Using a developmental typology inspired by some of the literature on speech development (Kahn and Lewis, The Kahn-Lewis phonological analysis, 1986; Shriberg, Journal of Speech and Hearing Research 36(1):105–140, 1993a), we found that failure to master the early-8 consonants and a greater prevalence of certain types of production errors were associated with deficient phonological awareness. We also found that children who made no consonant errors had advanced phonological awareness relative to other children in the sample. In all cases, both productive speech patterns and speech errors were more closely linked with rhyme awareness than with phoneme awareness. The association between speech production and rhyme awareness may provide some new directions for the early preschool assessment of risk for reading problems."

Regression analysis indicated that together the four comparison measures accounted for 36% of variance in overall EDI scores, each making a significant and unique contribution. Results supported the convergent validity of overall EDI scores but not the discriminant validity of EDI domain scores. Moreover, correlations between EDI scores and comparison measures varied widely across teachers, suggesting considerable individual differences in teacher’s ability to evaluate school readiness relative to direct, child-based assessments, and confirming that the EDI is more appropriate for deriving inferences at higher aggregated levels such as community or region. The validation of EDI domain scores remains an important challenge in future research."

These children were about 6–7 years of age but in the majority of cases unable to read when they entered school. Testing phonemic awareness with a newly developed, rather simple and natural vowel substitution task revealed that many children showed not a single correct response or little success. In contrast, the few readers at the beginning of grade one exhibited high phonemic awareness and after a few months of reading instruction most of the children scored at least close to perfect in the vowel substitution task. Despite this apparent effect of reading on phonemic awareness there was a specific predictive relationship between initial phonemic awareness differences and success in learning to read and to spell. In agreement with other studies it was found that phonemic awareness differences before instruction predicted the accuracy of alphabetic reading and spelling at the end of grade one independent from IQ and initial differences in letter knowledge and reading. However, closer examination of the relationship between phonemic awareness before instruction and later success in learning to read revealed a specific pattern. Children with high phonemic awareness at the beginning of grade one showed uniformly high reading and spelling achievement at the end of grade one."

English and Spanish PA factors were related to each other (.93 and .83 at the student and classroom levels, respectively) as well as to word reading, both within languages (correlations estimated between .74 and .93) and across languages (correlations estimated between .47 and .79). Although the PA constructs were statistically separable in each language, the high correlation between Spanish and English PA indicates considerable overlap in these abilities."

Bishop, Kimberley E. Bloor, Gemma L. Boyle, Janet Fletcher, John H. Hogben, Charles A. Wigley, Stephanie H. M. Yeong","Rationale 
Phonological awareness, letter knowledge, oral language (including sentence recall) and rapid automatised naming are acknowledged within-child predictors of literacy development. Separate research has identified family factors including socio-economic status, parents’ level of education and family history. However, both approaches have left unexplained significant amounts of variance in literacy outcomes. This longitudinal study sought to improve prospective classification accuracy for young children at risk of literacy failure by adding two new family measures (parents’ phonological awareness and parents’ perceived self-efficacy), and then combining the within-child and family factors.


Method 
Pre-literacy skills were measured in 102 four year olds (46 girls and 56 boys) at the beginning of Preschool, and then at the beginning and end of Kindergarten, when rapid automatised naming was also measured. Family factors data were collected at the beginning of Preschool, and children’s literacy outcomes were measured at the end of Year 1 (age 6–7 years).


Results 
Children from high-risk backgrounds showed poorer literacy outcomes than low-risk students, though three family factors (school socio-economic status, parents’ phonological awareness, and family history) typically accounted for less Year 1 variance than the within-child factors. Combining these family factors with the end of Kindergarten within-child factors provided the most accurate classification (i.e., sensitivity = .85; specificity = .90; overall correct = .88).


Implications 
Our approach would identify at-risk children for intervention before they began to fail. Moreover, it would be cost-effective because although few at-risk children would be missed, allocation of unnecessary educational resources would be minimised."

The relation of phonological awareness in French to reading achievement in each of the languages were equivalent to that in English. These relations remained significant after partialing out the influences of speeded naming and pseudoword repetition.

Data from a longitudinal study of reading acquisition are then reported. This study included assessments of phonological skills in children before they had begun to learn to read. The results of the study suggest that (a) even if learning to read is conceptualised as a sequence of stages, not all children pass through the same sequence of stages, (b) phonological awareness and reading acquisition have a reciprocal interactive causal relationship, not a unidirectional one, and (c) phonological skills can play a role in the very first stage of learning to read among phonologically adept children. Hence, it is incorrect to claim that the first stage of learning to read always involves such non-phonological procedures as “logographic” processing."

Peterson, Bruce F. Pennington, Lawrence D. Shriberg, Richard Boada","In the present study, we used a longitudinal design to investigate the relationship between childhood speech sound disorder (SSD) and literacy development. It is well documented that as a group, preschoolers with SSD are at increased risk for later reading disability (RD), or developmental dyslexia (Bird, Bishop, & Freeman, 1995; Larrivee & Catts, 1999; Lewis & Freebairn, 1992). Similarly, children with RD have elevated rates of previous SSD (Pennington & Lefly, 2001; Scarborough, 1990). The two disorders are comorbid at a rate of approximately 25%–30% (Gallagher, Frith, & Snowling, 2000; Lewis, 1996; Pennington & Lefly, 2001). The overlap of RD and SSD is not surprising because research during the past several decades has demonstrated that RD is associated with impairments in phonological processing (Vellutino, Fletcher, Snowling, & Scanlon, 2004), whereas the defining symptom in SSD is difficulty producing developmentally appropriate speech. Thus, a common assumption has been that a phonological processing deficit confers risk for both RD and SSD.

Research findings, in fact, indicate more complex associations between SSD and RD. One consistent finding has been that children whose early language difficulties are limited to expressive phonology have fairly good literacy outcome, whereas children with broader (i.e., syntactic–semantic) language difficulties are much more likely to develop RD (Bishop & Adams, 1990; Catts, 1993; Levi, Capozzi, Fabrizi, & Sechi, 1982; Shriberg & Kwiatkowski, 1988). The overlap of SSD and RD, therefore, appears to be due at least partly to the fact that each is also comorbid with language impairment (LI)."

Transition probabilities were calculated for the full sample and for children living above and below poverty. The findings indicate that children living below poverty are less likely to experience successful reading transitions than their above-poverty peers. However, children in the below-poverty group who began kindergarten with at least early phonological processing experienced transition probabilities similar to their above-poverty peers.

Carlson, David J. Francis, Barbara R. Foorman, Jack M. Fletcher","It is widely accepted that deficits in phonological awareness skills are related to reading difficulties. Recently, another source of reading difficulty has been identified that involves naming speed, and combined impairments in phonological skills and naming speed will produce more severe reading deficits than single deficits in either of these cognitive skills. The purpose of this study was to investigate the consequences of grouping children based on the presence or absence of deficits in these skills. We demonstrate that the greater severity of reading impairment found in children with a double deficit could be due in part to a statistical artifact caused by grouping children based on their performance on two correlated continuous variables. This artifact also makes it difficult to establish the relative impact of deficits in naming speed on reading ability independent of deficits in phonological awareness."

The results of 4 experiments speak against the idea that children go through a stage of spelling development during which they are equally likely to symbolize any sequence of phonemes that matches the name of a letter with the corresponding letter. Although kindergarteners and first graders sometimes spell the nonword /var/ as «vr,» using the letter r to represent both of the phonemes in its name, they are less likely to spell the nonword /ves/ as «vs» or the nonword /tib/ as «tb.» These differences are interpreted as reflecting the phonological or sound properties of the letters' names"

This article offers a preliminary typology of children's emergent literacy skills, a review of the evidence that relates emergent literacy to reading, and a review of the evidence for linkage between children's emergent literacy environments and the development of emergent literacy skills. We propose that emergent literacy consists of at least two distinct domains: inside-out skills (e.g., phonological awareness, letter knowledge) and outside-in skills (e.g., language, conceptual knowledge). These different domains are not the product of the same experiences and appear to be influential at different points in time during reading acquisition. Whereas outside-in skills are associated with those aspects of children's literacy environments typically measured, little is known about the origins of inside-out skills. Evidence from interventions to enhance emergent literacy suggests that relatively intensive and multifaceted interventions are needed to improve reading achievement maximally. A number of successful preschool interventions for outside-in skills exist, and computer-based tasks designed to teach children inside-out skills seem promising. Future research directions include more sophisticated multidimensional examination of emergent literacy skills and environments, better integration with reading research, and longer-term evaluation of preschool interventions. Policy implications for emergent literacy intervention and reading education are discussed."

This study was designed to examine the behavioral profiles of two groups, a younger (6–8 years) and an older (10–15 years) group of dyslexic children for the purposes of (1) evaluating the degree to which phonological awareness and processing speed deficits occur in the two developmental cohorts; (2) determining the strength of relationships between the groups’ respective mean scores on cognitive tasks of phonological awareness and processing speed and their scores on component skills of reading; and (3) evaluating the degree to which phonological awareness and processing speed serve as concurrent predictors of component reading skills for each group. The mean scaled scores for both groups were similar on all but one processing speed task. The older group was significantly more depressed on a visual matching test of attention, scanning, and speed. Correlations between reading skills and the cognitive constructs were very similar for both age-groups. Neither of the two phonological awareness tasks correlated with either of the two processing speed tasks or with any of the three measures of reading. One of the two processing speed measures served as a concurrent predictor of word- and text-level reading in the younger, however, only the rapid naming measure functioned as a concurrent predictor of word reading in the older group. Conversely, phonological processing measures did not serve as concurrent predictors for word-level or text-level reading in either of the groups. Descriptive analyses of individual subjects’ deficits in the domains of phonological awareness and processing speed revealed that (1) both linguistic and nonlinguistic processing speed deficits in the younger dyslexic children occurred at higher rates than deficits in phonological awareness and (2) cognitive deficits within and across these two domains were greater in the older dyslexic children. Our findings underscore the importance of using rapid naming measures when testing school-age children suspected of having a reading disability and suggest that processing speed measures that do not reply on verbal responses may serve as predictors of reading disability in young children prior to their development of naming automaticity."

The participants in the study were 111 preschool children with a mean age of 58.09 months (SD = 5.80) attending Head Start. Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that lower levels of impulsivity (consisting of persistence, negative emotionality, and activity-level characteristics) and lower levels of inhibition made unique contributions to higher letter knowledge and print concepts skills. Theoretical implications for early childhood education and directions for future research are highlighted."

Multilevel modeling was used to examine letter name and sound learning as a function of instructional condition and characteristics of both letters and children. Specifically, learning was examined in light of letter name structure, whether letter names included cues to their respective sounds, and children’s phonological processing skills. Consistent with past research, children receiving letter name and sound instruction were most likely to learn the sounds of letters whose names included cues to their sounds regardless of phonological processing skills. Only children with higher phonological skills showed a similar effect in the control condition. Practical implications are discussed."

Broen","This investigation is a follow-up to a longitudinal speech and educational outcome study involving approximately 400 normally developing children that was initiated in 1960. From this database, two groups of subjects (now aged 32-34), their spouses, and all of their offspring over the age of 3:0 (years:months) completed a battery of cognitive-linguistic and interview measures. One group (probands) consisted of 24 adults with a documented history of a moderate phonological-language disorder that persisted through at least the end of the first grade. The other group (controls) consisted of 28 adults who were known to have had normal articulation abilities as children. Results of this study demonstrated that, in comparison to the children of controls, the children of the proband subjects performed significantly more poorly on all tests of articulation and expressive language functioning and were significantly more likely to have received articulation treatment. There was, however, no evidence that specific misarticulations or phonological processes traveled within proband families. These results are in agreement with those of most previous family studies that have demonstrated an increased rate of occurrence of speech-language disorders of unknown origin in families including a first-degree relative who is similarly affected."

In first grade, measures were administered for phonological awareness and serial rapid naming and for vocabulary and listening comprehension. Word-decoding speed and reading comprehension were assessed at the end of Grades 1 and 3. Results indicate that phonological abilities were highly associated with word decoding but did not have an additional influence on the further development of word decoding after first grade. For reading comprehension, word decoding, vocabulary, and listening comprehension appeared to exert additional influences on its further development after first grade. The results indicate that partly different determinants underlie the development of word-decoding ability and reading comprehension."

Study 1 showed faster absolute naming speeds for those with near perfect untimed alphabet recitation, but the stronger and more orderly relation (at r=.31, p<.0001) was between three levels of alphabet recitation accuracy and the relative number/letter naming speed advantage (ratio of mean number/letter naming speed minus mean color/object naming speed over mean color/object naming speed). In Study 2, the number/letter advantage was already strongly present by first grade, and did not increase significantly thereafter, but absolute naming times improved steadily across grades in an exponential decay function. In this sample, the relative number/letter advantage was not related to reading level. However, the absolute color/object naming speed was strongly related to reading level and vocabulary across grades.

There are drawbacks to all the explications, but a relatively acceptable one is available when the independent variables have a relevant, known ordering: consider the proportion of variance of the dependent variable linearly accounted for by the first independent variable; then consider the proportion of remaining variance linearly accounted for by the second independent variable; and so on. When, however, the independent variables do not have a relevant ordering, that approach fails. The primary suggestion of this article is to rescue the idea by averaging relative importance over all orderings of the independent variables. Variations and extensions of the idea are described."

In the MyTeachingPartner project, 154 teachers were provided with materials to implement a supplemental classroom curriculum addressing six aspects of literacy and language development. The present study examines the degree of variability in three aspects of implementation fidelity – dosage, adherence, and quality of delivery – and whether these components of fidelity were associated with children's growth in language and literacy skills across the preschool year. Findings indicate that teachers reported using the curriculum fairly often (dosage) and that they were observed to generally follow curricular lesson plans (adherence). In contrast, the quality of delivery, defined as the use of evidence-based teacher–child interactions for teaching literacy and language, was much lower. Children in classrooms in which activities were observed to last for longer (dosage) and in which teachers exhibited higher quality of delivery of literacy lessons made significantly greater gains in early literacy skills across the preschool year. Also, teachers’ use of higher quality language interactions was associated with gains for children who did not speak English at home. Results have implications for teacher professional development and the supports provided to ensure that curricula are delivered most effectively."

Smith,"Genetic factors are important contributors to language and learning disorders, and discovery of the underlying genes can help delineate the basic neurological pathways that are involved. This information, in turn, can help define disorders and their perceptual and processing deficits. Initial molecular genetic studies of dyslexia, for example, appear to converge on defects in neuronal and axonal migration. Further study of individuals with abnormalities of these genes may lead to the recognition of characteristic cognitive deficits attributable to the neurological dysfunction. Such abnormalities may affect other disorders as well, and studies of co-morbidity of dyslexia with attention deficit disorder and speech sound disorder are helping to define the scope of these genes and show the etiological and cognitive commonalities between these conditions. The genetic contributions to specific language impairment (SLI) are not as well defined at this time, but similar molecular approaches are being applied to identify genes that influence SLI and comorbid disorders. While there is co-morbidity of SLI with dyslexia, it appears that most of the common genetic effects may be with the language characteristics of autism spectrum disorders rather than with dyslexia and related disorders. Identification of these genes and their neurological and cognitive effects should lay out a functional network of interacting genes and pathways that subserve language development. Understanding these processes can form the basis for refined procedures for diagnosis and treatment. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. MRDD Research Reviews 2007;13:96–105."

The novel word-learning task consisted of an acquisition and retention phase in which children received a series of trials to learn to produce four novel words. Half of the children with hearing impairment performed comparably to the children with normal hearing on all of the measures obtained, whereas the other 10 children with hearing impairment performed more poorly than the higher functioning children with hearing impairment and all of the children with normal hearing on most of the measures of language, phonological processing, and novel word learning. Degree of hearing loss was not related to language or word-learning abilities. These findings suggest that the population of children with mild-to-moderate hearing loss may contain two distinct groups: a group of normally developing children who have a hearing loss and a group of children with language impairment who have a hearing loss.

Children were to learn novel labels for unfamiliar objects in a paired-associate paradigm. In both studies, print facilitated the acquisition and recall of expressive vocabulary. The effect of print consistency, however, varied across studies. As expected, monolingual children exposed to consistent print learned more novel labels than children exposed to inconsistent print. In contrast, bilingual children exposed to inconsistent print learned and recalled more labels than children exposed to consistent print. These intriguing findings might be due to differences in attention allocation during training."

SLI has a prevalence of ∼7% in children entering school and is associated with later difficulties in learning to read. Research indicates that genetic factors are important in the etiology of SLI. Studies have consistently demonstrated that SLI aggregates in families. Increased monozygotic versus dizygotic twin concordance rates indicate that heredity, not just shared environment, is the cause of the familial clustering. We have collected five pedigrees of Celtic ancestry that segregate SLI, and we have conducted genomewide categorical linkage analysis, using model-based LOD score techniques. Analysis was conducted under both dominant and recessive models by use of three phenotypic classifications: clinical diagnosis, language impairment (spoken language quotient 15).

Based on the Baddeley and Hitch model of working memory, traditional serial recall tasks of word length and phonological similarity were used to examine the efficiency of subvocal rehearsal and short-term storage, respectively. Analysis of recall performance for lists of four and six words revealed that, in comparison to agematched controls, children with phonological impairment are similarly sensitive to the effects of word length and phonological similarity, but demonstrate poorer overall recall for word lists of unrelated items. Theoretically, these findings suggest that the subvocal rehearsal mechanism and the phonological short-term store appear to be operating efficiently in this group of children with phonological impairment. Therefore their poorer recall performance may be attributable to interactions between short-term memory processes and aspects of phonologica..."

Lee, K. Lawson","Natural sound environments are dynamic, with overlapping acoustic input originating from simultaneously active sources. A key function of the auditory system is to integrate sensory inputs that belong together and segregate those that come from different sources. We hypothesized that this skill is impaired in individuals with phonological processing difficulties. There is considerable disagreement about whether phonological impairments observed in children with developmental language disorders can be attributed to specific linguistic deficits or to more general acoustic processing deficits. However, most tests of general auditory abilities have been conducted with a single set of sounds. We assessed the ability of school-aged children (7–15 years) to parse complex auditory non-speech input, and determined whether the presence of phonological processing impairments was associated with stream perception performance. A key finding was that children with language impairments did not show the same developmental trajectory for stream perception as typically developing children. In addition, children with language impairments required larger frequency separations between sounds to hear distinct streams compared to age-matched peers. Furthermore, phonological processing ability was a significant predictor of stream perception measures, but only in the older age groups. No such association was found in the youngest children. These results indicate that children with language impairments have difficulty parsing speech streams, or identifying individual sound events when there are competing sound sources. We conclude that language group differences may in part reflect fundamental maturational disparities in the analysis of complex auditory scenes."

Further, phonological decoding significantly mediated the relation between group membership and word recognition, whereas neither orthographic processing nor RAN did so. The group with ID also underperformed the TD group on phonological awareness and phonological memory, both of which significantly mediated the relation between group membership and phonological decoding. These data suggest that poor word recognition in youth with ID may be due largely to poor phonological decoding, which in turn may be due largely to poor phonological awareness and poor phonological memory. More focus on phonological skills in the classroom may help students with ID to develop better word recognition skills."

Key research questions addressed in this study are (a) do readers with different subtypes of dyslexia display differences in fluency at particular reading levels (e.g., letter, word, and connected text)? and (b) do children with dyslexia identified by either low-achievement or ability—achievement discrepancy criteria show similar differences when classified by the DDH? To address these questions, the authors assessed a sample of 158 children with severe reading impairments in second and third grades on an extensive battery and classified them into three reader subtypes using the DDH. The results demonstrated that the three DDH subtypes exhibited differences in fluency at different levels of reading (letter, word, and connected text), underscoring the separate reading profiles of these subtypes and the different possible routes to dysfluency in reading disabilities.

Siegel","The double-deficit hypothesis of developmental dyslexia proposes that deficits in phonological processing and naming speed represent independent sources of dysfunction in dyslexia. The present article is a review of the evidence for the double-deficit hypothesis, including a discussion of recent findings related to the hypothesis. Studies in this area have been characterized by variability in methodology— how dyslexia is defined and identified, and how dyslexia subtypes are classified. Such variability sets limitations on the extent to which conclusions may be drawn with respect to the double-deficit hypothesis. Furthermore, the literature is complicated by the persistent finding that measures of phonological processing and naming speed are significantly correlated, resulting in a statistical artifact that makes it difficult to disentangle the influence of naming speed from that of phonological processing. Longitudinal and intervention studies of the double-deficit hypothesis are needed to accumulate evid..."

Snowling, Sara Taylor","We present a longitudinal study of children in the first two years of learning to read. A battery of tests of phonological skills administered when the children were prereaders identified two distinct and relatively independent factors, Rhyming (defined by measures of rhyme detection and rhyme production) and Segmentation (defined by measures of phoneme identification and phoneme deletion). Segmentation was strongly correlated with attainment in reading and spelling at the end of the first year at school, though Rhyming was not. In addition, letter name knowledge predicted both reading and spelling skill and showed an interactive effect with children's segmentation skills. By the end of the second year of school, however, rhyming had started to exert a predictive effect on spelling, but not on reading. The results are discussed in the context of current theories of the role of phonological skills in learning to read."

Jones, Mateo Obregón, M. Louise Kelly, Holly P. Branigan","Abstract The relationship between rapid automatized naming (RAN) and reading fluency is well documented (see Wolf, M. & Bowers, P.G. (1999). The double-deficit hypothesis for the developmental dyslexias . Journal of Educational Psychology, 91(3), 415–438, for a review), but little is known about which component processes are important in RAN, and why developmental dyslexics show longer latencies on these tasks. Researchers disagree as to whether these delays are caused by impaired phonological processing or whether extra-phonological processes also play a role (e.g., Clarke, P., Hulme, C., & Snowling, M. (2005). Individual differences in RAN and reading: A response timing analysis. Journal of Research in Reading, 28 (2), 73–86; Wolf, M., Bowers, P.G., & Biddle, K. (2000). Naming-speed processes, timing, and reading: A conceptual review. Journal of learning disabilities, 33 (4), 387–407). We conducted an eye-tracking study that manipulated phonological and visual information (as representative of extra-phonological processes) in RAN. Results from linear mixed (LME) effects analyses showed that both phonological and visual processes influence naming-speed for both dyslexic and non-dyslexic groups, but the influence on dyslexic readers is greater. Moreover, dyslexic readers’ difficulties in these domains primarily emerge in a measure that explicitly includes the production phase of naming. This study elucidates processes underpinning RAN performance in non-dyslexic readers and pinpoints areas of difficulty for dyslexic readers. We discuss these findings with reference to phonological and extra-phonological hypotheses of naming-speed deficits."

Vellutino, Jack M. Fletcher, Margaret J. Snowling, Donna M. Scanlon","We summarize some of the most important findings from research evaluating the hypothesized causes of specific reading disability (dyslexia) over the past four decades. After outlining components of reading ability, we discuss manifest causes of reading difficulties, in terms of deficiencies in component reading skills that might lead to such difficulties. The evidence suggests that inadequate facility in word identification due, in most cases, to more basic deficits in alphabetic coding is the basic cause of difficulties in learning to read. We next discuss hypothesized deficiencies in readingrelated cognitive abilities as underlying causes of deficiencies in component reading skills. The evidence in these areas suggests that, in most cases, phonological skills deficiencies associated with phonological coding deficits are the probable causes of the disorder rather than visual, semantic, or syntactic deficits, although reading difficulties in some children may be associated with general language deficits. Hypothesized deficits in general learning abilities (e.g., attention, association learning, cross-modal transfer etc.) and low-level sensory deficits have weak validity as causal factors in specific reading disability. These inferences are, by and large, supported by research evaluating the biological foundations of dyslexia. Finally, evidence is presented in support of the idea that many poor readers are impaired because of inadequate instruction or other experiential factors. This does not mean that biological factors are not relevant, because the brain and environment interact to produce the neural networks that support reading acquisition. We conclude with a discussion of the clinical implications of the research findings, focusing on the need for enhanced instruction."

Using an experimental group design, four first-grade classrooms were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group.

James, Jan van Doorn, Sharynne McLeod, Adrian Esterman","Children with and without speech, language and/or literacy impairment, delete consonants when they name pictures to elicit single words. Consonant deletion seems to be more frequent in long words (words of three or more syllables) than in short words (words of one or two syllables). However, it may be missed in long words because they are not routinely assessed and, even if they are, there is little normative data about them. The study aims were (1) to determine if a relationship exists between consonant deletion and the number of syllables in words, (2) delimit variation in the numbers of children using it, its frequency of occurrence and the words it affects and (3) to discuss the application of these data to clinical practice. The participants were 283 typically developing children, aged 3;0 to 7;11 years, speaking Australian English with proven normal language, cognition and hearing. They named pictures, yielding 166 selected words that were varied for syllable number, stress and shape and repeatedly sampled all consonants and vowels of Australian English. Almost all participants (95%) used consonant deletion. Whilst a relationship existed between consonant deletion frequency and the number of syllables in words, the syllable effect was interpreted as a proxy of an interaction of segmental and prosodic features that included two or more syllables, sonorant sounds, non-final weak syllables, within-word consonant sequences and/or anterior-posterior articulatory movements. Clinically, two or three deletions of consonants across the affected words may indicate typical behaviour for children up to the age of 7;11 years but variations outside these tolerances may mark impairment. These results are further evidence to include long words in routine speech assessment."

According to the double-deficit hypothesis (Wolf & Bowers, 1999), these children belong to the group who show the most pronounced difficulties when learning how to read and write. Our results suggest that children with a double deficit are at great risk of developing dyslexia unless they receive specific support. Moreover, the results of the intervention study are the first to show how German speaking children with a double deficit can be adequately supported within the framework of standard beginners’ reading and writing lessons in inclusive classrooms so that impending difficulties in the acquisition of written language can be successfully prevented. The support measures focus on a training of phonological awareness and automatized processing of sublexical orthographic units. However, potential modifications of the training are currently being discussed since not all children in the training groups were able to benefit satisfactorily."

Language abilities, tested with an extensive test battery at the onset of formal reading instruction, were represented by four statistically uncorrelated factors: lexical-semantic abilities , auditory perception , verbal-sequential processing , and speech production . All factors contributed significantly to the prediction of word reading and spelling development seven months later. Verbal-sequential processing was the strongest predictor for both word decoding and spelling. Furthermore, autoregression effects of word decoding and spelling were strong and verbal-sequential processing had predictive value on word spelling nineteen months later when pre-existing spelling abilities were accounted for. Children with SLI and normal literacy skills performed better on most of the language and language-related measures than children with SLI and poor literacy skills. Learning outcomes: As a result of this activity, readers will describe four language domains that are related to later literacy skills in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). As a result of this activity, readers will recognize the predictive value of each of these language domains and the important role of verbal-sequential processing in learning to decode and writing words for children with SLI. As a result of this activity, readers will recall the differences in language proficiencies between children with SLI who develop normal literacy skills and those who encounter literacy problems."

Findings from two experimental studies suggest that the phonological deficits of dyslexic children and adults cannot be explained in terms of impairments in low-level auditory mechanisms, but reflect higher-level language weaknesses. A study of individual differences in the pattern of reading skills in dyslexic children rejects the notion of ‘sub-types’. Instead, the findings suggest that the variation seen in reading processes can be accounted for by differences in the severity of individual children's phonological deficits, modified by compensatory factors including visual memory, perceptual speed and print exposure. Children at genetic risk who go on to be dyslexic come to the task of reading with poorly specified phonological representations in the context of a more general delay in oral language development. Their prognosis (and that of their unaffected siblings) depends upon the balance of strengths and difficulties they show, with better language skills being a protective factor. Taken together, these findings suggest that current challenges to the phonological deficit theory can be met. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Gullick, James R. Booth","Crossmodal integration of auditory and visual information, such as phonemes and graphemes, is a critical skill for fluent reading. Previous work has demonstrated that white matter connectivity along the arcuate fasciculus AF is predicted by reading skill and that crossmodal processing particularly activates the posterior STS pSTS. However, the relationship between this crossmodal activation and white matter integrity has not been previously reported. We investigated the interrelationship of crossmodal integration, both in terms of behavioral performance and pSTS activity, with AF tract coherence using a rhyme judgment task in a group of 47 children with a range of reading abilities. We demonstrate that both response accuracy and pSTS activity for crossmodal auditory-visual rhyme judgments was predictive of fractional anisotropy along the left AF. Unimodal auditory-only or visual-only pSTS activity was not significantly related to AF connectivity. Furthermore, activity in other reading-related ROIs did not show the same AV-only AF coherence relationship, and AV pSTS activity was not related to connectivity along other language-related tracts. This study is the first to directly show that crossmodal brain activity is specifically related to connectivity in the AF, supporting its role in phoneme-grapheme integration ability.

1140,2100681908,alphabetism in reading science,2014,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00752,Frontiers in Psychology,David L. Share,"There has been mounting concern among social scientists that conclusions from studies conducted on highly educated populations from affluent European cultures may have limited applicability to human behavior in general (Henrich et al., 2010). Similar reservations have also been voiced in the fields of language (Evans and Levinson, 2009) and literacy (Share, 2008a; Frost, 2012). Reading research, in particular, has been overwhelmingly dominated by work on English, which appears to be an outlier among European alphabets (Seymour et al., 2003; Share, 2008a). I have argued that because spelling–sound relations are so complex in English orthography, much of reading research has been confined to a narrow Anglocentric research agenda addressing theoretical and applied issues with only limited relevance for a universal science of reading and literacy.

My intention here is not to reiterate my 2008 arguments or even expand them, but to move on to another major obstacle to progress. Before moving on, however, I would like to add a note of optimism to the Anglocentrism debate. In recent years, interest in other languages has indeed begun to emerge from the shadows probably because the scientific community of Anglo-American reading researchers has felt itself “come of age” as a substantial body of well-replicated and converging findings has coalesced in recent years, at least on several key topics such as word identification and dyslexia (Vellutino et al., 2004; Snowling and Hulme, 2005; DeHaene, 2009; Rayner et al., 2012). The field is now witnessing important first steps toward universal models of reading (Perfetti, 2003; Perfetti et al., 2005; Ziegler and Goswami, 2005; Frost, 2012) as well as a growing number of linguistically and grammatologically informed studies emerging outside the confines of English and other European alphabets (Nag and Perfetti, 2014; Saiegh-Haddad and Joshi, 2014; Verhoeven and Perfetti, 2014). It is still the case, nonetheless, that the theoretical and applied frameworks developed for English are all too frequently being applied to other languages and writing systems without due consideration for linguistic and writing system diversity. Almost all publications by English-language researchers continue to omit any “…in English” qualification in the titles of their papers—“A New Whiz-Bang+++ Model of Learning to Read”… in English?—as if the results of studies conducted in English alone enjoy the privileged status of universal applicability, unlike researchers investigating other languages who are obliged to qualify their findings by adding the “…in Chinese/Arabic/Korean etc.” disclaimer which automatically demarcates the findings as language-specific and hence not necessarily universally applicable.

Here, I focus on yet another “-ism,” which I call “alphabetism”; the belief that alphabetic writing systems are inherently superior to non-alphabetic systems, and which, like Anglocentrism, has also stymied psychologists' and educators' thinking about learning to read across diverse writing systems. Here too, I join other scholars who have also expressed concerns about “alphabetolatry,” or alphabetic “supremacism” (e.g., Rogers, 1995). Looking around the globe, it is apparent that most individuals do not acquire literacy in a European alphabet, yet in many parts of the (non-European) world, the belief that alphabetic orthographies are the ideal has led to calls to alphabetize or discard non-alphabetic scripts. Needless to say, these proposals have profound ramifications for instruction and curriculum.

In the past, many influential Western scholars explicitly argued that alphabets are inherently superior to non-alphabetic writing systems (Taylor, 1883; Gelb, 1963; Havelock, 1982). The shelves of most college libraries abound with volumes whose very titles idealize the alphabet (e.g., Diringer's The Alphabet: A Key to the History of Mankind; Moorhouse's Triumph of the Alphabet). When reading researchers today seek enlightenment on the subject of writing systems they refer to Gelb—the founding father of the field of “grammatology” (Gelb, 1963). Like Taylor (1883) before him, Gelb (1963) propounded an evolutionary view of writing system history from “primitive” pre-alphabetic systems to alphabetic. Consistent with the “ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny” idea, Gelb's inexorable “three great steps [logographic-to-syllabic-to-alphabetic] by which writing evolved from the primitive stages to a full alphabet” (p. 203) was embraced by almost all reading researchers, despite its repudiation by subsequent scholarship in the field of writing systems research (Mattingly, 1985; Olson, 1989; Daniels, 1992, in press; Rogers, 2005; Coulmas, 2009). Foremost among these, perhaps, was Ferreiro in her Piagetian classic Literacy before Schooling (Ferreiro and Teberosky, 1979) and, subsequently, a series of stage-oriented theories of reading and writing development (Piagetian and non-Piagetian alike) all referring to pre-alphabetic and alphabetic stages (Gough and Hillinger, 1980; Marsh et al., 1981; Frith, 1985; Ehri, 2005). It needs to be pointed out, however, that the “culture” of alphabetism, like culture in general, is often “invisible”; its presence more often discernible in acts of omission rather than commission. Nonetheless, this alphabetic bias is ubiquitous and is manifest in;


1. Unqualified generalizations about reading “across languages” and/or “across orthographies” in papers that refer almost exclusively to English or to European alphabets (Ziegler and Goswami, 2005; Goswami, 2010; Ziegler et al., 2010; Caravolas et al., 2013; Ehri, 2014).


2. Implicit or explicit acceptance of Gelb's long-discarded evolutionary theory in leading texts on reading development aimed at educators,… “Taking the final step toward the creation of a true alphabetic writing system, the Greeks assigned a symbol to each consonant and vowel of their language… In many ways, the individual development of the children who are discovering the alphabetic principle in English writing recapitulates human history,” (Moats, 2000, pp. 82–83).


3. Even the most up-to-date and authoritative texts on the psychology of reading (e.g., DeHaene, 2009; Rayner et al., 2012) continue to regurgitate Gelb's views.



“[I]n an evolutionary sense, the alphabet is the “fittest…” p. 37”; The history of writing suggests a clear evolutionary trend…These systems evolved to a logographic system, which in turn evolved to syllabic systems and finally to alphabetic systems…Such an evolutionary argument suggests that alphabets are fitter (in the Darwinian sense)… Rayner et al. (2012, pp. 46–47).


4. Reference to non-alphabetic systems as imperfect or defective (e.g., Hannas, 2003; Rayner et al., 2012) as well as attempts to reframe non-alphabetic systems such as the Brahmi-derived Indic (abugidic/aksharik) scripts as alphabetic (Rimzhim et al., 2014).



…“The Semitic writing systems…and the languages of India still incompletely represent vowels. p 36… In this sense, many of these scripts are not fully alphabetic.” Rayner et al. p. 37.

“The Phonecian system, however, was not perfect. It failed to represent all vowels… It was the Greeks who finally created the alphabet as we know it… For the first time in the history of mankind, the alphabet allowed the Greeks to have a complete graphic inventory of their language sounds.” (DeHaene, 2009, p. 193).

“The basic difference between Western alphabetic and East Asian syllabic writing acts on several levels to promote or inhibit creativity, particularly that associated with breakthroughs in science… syllabic literacy entails a diminished propensity for abstract and analytical thought… Certain Asian characteristics credited with blocking creativity, such as conservative political and social institutions and group-oriented behavior, derive in part from effects that the orthography has had on the minds of individuals,” (Hannas, 2003, p. 203).


5. The use of alphabetic terminology (e.g., letters, graphemes) to describe and label the functional architecture (and even the anatomical brain structures) of reading (“letter detectors,” “letterbox area,” “universal letter shapes,” DeHaene, 2009) purported to be universal in reading. Whereas the concept of a letter (or grapheme) is widely used (but not entirely unproblematic) in European alphabets, it has questionable applicability to many writing systems such as Chinese characters, Japanese Kanji, Brahmi-derived Indic aksharas or Mayan glyphs. It has even been suggested that the notion of the “phoneme” as the fundamental unit of analysis of speech may be an artifact of West European alphabetic literacy (Daniels, in press).



Although some initial thoughts have been offered as to when an alphabet may or may not be the appropriate orthography (e.g., Perfetti and Harris, 2013), this topic is new to the agenda of reading science. Some historical background on the alphabet provides a valuable perspective on this issue."

Ziegler, Ulla Richardson","Within alphabetic languages, spelling-to-sound consistency can differ dramatically. For example, English and German are very similar in their phonological and orthographic structure but not in their consistency. In English the letter a is pronounced differently in the words bank, ball, and park, whereas in German the letter a always has the same pronunciation (e.g., Ball, Park, Bank). It is often argued that reading acquisition has a reciprocal effect on phonological awareness. As reading is acquired, therefore, spoken language representation may be affected differently for English and German children. Prior to literacy acquisition, however, phonological representation in English and German children should be similar due to the similar phonological structure of the two languages. We explored this hypothesis by comparing phonological awareness at the rime and phoneme levels in prereaders and beginning readers in English and German. Similar developmental effects were indeed observed in prereaders, but differential effects had emerged within the first year of reading instruction."

In a longitudinal study of a diverse sample of 44 preschool children, we examined the extent to which their understanding of the cardinal meanings of the number words (e.g., knowing that the word “four” refers to sets with 4 items) is predicted by the “number talk” they hear from their primary caregiver in the early home environment. Results from 5 visits showed substantial variation in parents’ number talk to children between the ages of 14 and 30 months. Moreover, this variation predicted children’s knowledge of the cardinal meanings of number words at 46 months, even when socioeconomic status and other measures of parent and child talk were controlled. These findings suggest that encouraging parents to talk about number with their toddlers, and providing them with effective ways to do so, may positively impact children’s school achievement."

When childrenusepinyintokey inletters,their spelling nolonger depends on reproducing the visuo-graphic properties of characters that are indispensable to Chinese reading, and, thus, typing in pinyin may conflict with the traditional learning processes for written Chinese. We therefore tested character reading ability and pinyin use by primary school children in three Chinese cites: Beijing (n = 466), Guangzhou (n = 477), and Jining (n = 4,908). Children with severe reading difficulty are defined as those who were normal in nonverbal IQ but two grades (i.e., 2 y) behind in character-reading achievement. We found that the overall incidence rate of severe reading difficulty appears to be much higher than ever reported on Chinese reading. Crucially, we found that children’s reading scores were significantly negatively correlated with their use of the pinyin input method, suggesting that pinyin typing on e-devices hinders Chinese reading development. The Chinese language has survived the technological challenges of the digital era, but the benefits of communicating digitally may come with a cost in proficient learning of written Chinese."

The phonological intervention programme was based on non-linear phonological analyses. The metaphonological intervention programme included both rhyming and alliteration tasks and was directly targeted during the last section of the programme. All children made significant gains in phonology, and many in metaphonology. However, the literature notes a tendency for children with history of early speech or language impairments to have difficulty acquiring literacy skills or to show residual speech impairment. The participants of the 1998 study were therefore considered at risk for continuing speech impairment and/or academic performance. Aims: The primary objectives were to document the children’s later speech, language and literacy skills, and to determine potential relationships between previous and concurrent child factors. Methods & Procedures: Twelve children from the original cohort (aged 6;1–8;5) received a comprehensive battery of speech, language, cognitive and academic tasks 3 years after the original study. Data were evaluated both concurrently and in terms of the children’s preschool performance. Outcomes & Results: Five of the children had residual phonological impairment. Only two children showed below average reading (decoding and comprehension), although five also showed below average spelling performance. Children with limitations in verbal memory, language production and metaphonology at the follow-up point were more likely to show delays in literacy. Language production skills at the follow-up point were most strongly correlated with literacy development. In terms of the early study, the strongest predictor for literacy development was performance on metaphonology tasks at the end of the early intervention study. The strongest predictor for ongoing speech impairment was phonological skill at the end of the early study."

This study sought to determine what elements of RAN are responsible for the shared variance between RAN and reading performance using a series of cognitive tasks and a latent variable modelling approach. Participants performed RAN measures, a test of reading speed and comprehension, and six tasks, which tapped various hypothesised components of the RAN. RAN shared 10% of the variance with reading comprehension and 17% with reading rate.

Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that naming speed, as measured by the the rapid automatized naming (RAN) task, accounted for a sizable amount of unique variance in reading with vocabulary and phonemic awareness partialled out. The unique contribution of naming speed to reading was relatively stronger for orthographic skills, whereas the contribution of phonemic skills was stronger for nonword decoding. In further analyses, marked difficulties on a range of reading tasks, including orthographic processing, were seen in a subgroup with a double deficit (slow naming speed and low phonemic awareness) but not in groups with only a single deficit.

Although children know which letters belong to which speech sounds within months, it takes much longer to automatically integrate them into newly constructed audiovisual objects. This extended learning process corresponds with observations that reliable letter and word specific activations in the fusiform cortex also occur relatively late in reading development. The present review discusses electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies of the nature and mechanisms involved in letter–speech sound integration in normal and dyslexic readers. It is demonstrated that letter–speech sound associations do not develop in parallel with visual letter recognition but immediately work in concert to form orthographic–phonological bonds which remain active even in experienced reading. Effective letter–speech sound integration may be necessary for reliable letter recognition to develop. In contrast, it is this basic integration of letters and speech sounds which poses an immediate problem for beginning dyslexic readers, and remains problematic in adult dyslexic readers. It is hypothesized that a specific orthographic–phonological binding deficit may not only act as a proximal cause for reading deficits in dyslexia, but may also explain the notorious lack of reading fluency. Finally, it is suggested that similar integrated audiovisual representations may also exist for larger grain-sizes in the same posterior occipitotemporal/inferoparietal network as identified for orthographic–phonological integration of letters and speech sounds."

The correlation between discrete and serial word reading was very high in Grade 2 but only moderate in Grade 6. In confirmatory factor analysis, a reading–naming latent structure fit the Grade 2 data best; in contrast, a serial–discrete structure fit the Grade 6 data. Thus, the superficial longitudinal stability of RAN–reading correlations belies vastly different patterns of interrelations, indicative of changes in the developing cognitive processes underlying both naming and reading. Word fluency tasks in Grade 2 are apparently accomplished largely as a series of isolated individual word naming trials even though multiple individual letters in each word may be processed in parallel. In contrast, specifically serial procedures are applied in Grade 6, presumably via simultaneous processing of multiple individual words at successive levels. It is proposed that this feat requires endogenous control of cognitive cascades."

A “good news”/“bad news” metaphor is used to summarize the advances and roadblocks that exist in both research and practice in language learning disabilities. The centrality of language in literacy and academic success is emphasized throughout the discussion. Professionals are encouraged to evaluate the appropriateness and relevance of their language intervention decisions and to take a hard look at some of the popular ideas in school-age language disorders that require further scrutiny."

Hart, Jessica A. R. Logan, Brooke Soden-Hensler, Sarah Kershaw, Jeanette Taylor, Christopher Schatschneider","Research on the development of reading skills through the primary school years has pointed to the importance of individual differences in initial ability as well as the growth of those skills. Additionally, it has been theorized that reading skills develop incrementally. The present study examined the genetic and environmental influences on two developmental models representing these parallel ideas, generalizing the findings to explore the processes of reading development. Participants were drawn from the Florida Twin Project on Reading, with a total of 2370 pairs of twins’ representative of the state of Florida. Twins’ oral reading fluency scores from school progress monitoring records collected in the fall of grades 1 through 5 were used to model development. Results suggested that genetic influences on the development of reading are general, shared across the early school years, as well as novel, with new genetic influences introduced at each of the first three years of school. The shared environment estimates suggest a pattern of general influences only, suggesting environmental effects which are moderate and stable across development."

Francis","Learning the sounds of letters is an important part of learning to read and spell. To explore the factors that make some letter-sound correspondences easier for children to learn than others, we first analyzed knowledge of letters' sounds (and names) by 660 children between 31/2 and 71/2 years old. A second study examined preschoolers' (M age 4 years, 11 months) ability to learn various sound-letter mappings. Together, the results show that an important determinant of letter-sound knowledge is whether the sound occurs in the name of the letter and, if so, whether it is at the beginning or the end. The properties of the sound itself (consonant versus vowel, sonorant versus obstruent, stop versus continuant) appear to have little or no influence on children's learning of basic letter-sound correspondences. The findings show that children use their knowledge of letters' names when learning the letters' sounds rather than memorizing letter-sound correspondences as arbitrary pairings."

The children were retested at the end of kindergarten on phonemic awareness, word identification, decoding, and spelling. Children who entered school with advanced levels of phonemic awareness scored significantly higher on each of the measures. Alphabetic knowledge predicted literacy development, but phonemic awareness accounted for significant additional variance in decoding and spelling.

Foram realizadas a primeira e a segunda tomada de leitura oral de um texto, selecionado a partir da indicacao dos professores da 4a serie; a primeira e a segunda tomada de compreensao por meio de quatro perguntas apresentadas sequencialmente ao texto, em que os escolares deveriam responder oralmente; e a prova de nomeacao rapida do Teste de Desempenho Cognitivo-Linguistico, versao individual. RESULTADOS: Houve diferenca entre a primeira e a segunda compreensao e entre nomeacao rapida, primeira e segunda leitura. Houve forte correlacao entre compreensao e leitura, sugerindo que o desempenho na primeira tomada de leitura influenciou de forma significativa o desempenho na segunda tomada de leitura; o mesmo ocorreu para a compreensao. CONCLUSAO: A defasagem na realizacao das atividades de nomeacao, leitura e compreensao na primeira avaliacao ocasionou falhas no mecanismo de conversao fonema-grafema que podem ser suficientes para desencadear dificuldades na aprendizagem da leitura.(AU) PURPOSE: To compare and correlate the performance of students with learning difficulties in rapid naming, reading and comprehension. METHODS: Participants were 32 students from 4th grade of elementary school of both genders, with ages between 11 years and 4 months and 12 years and 7 months. The first and second oral reading of a text selected based on the indication of 4th grade teachers were conducted, as well as the first and second reading comprehension task composed by four questions presented right after the reading, to which students should answered orally, and the rapid naming task from the Test of Cognitive-Linguistic Performance, individual version. RESULTS: Differences were found between the first and the second comprehension scores, and between rapid naming, first and second reading. There was a strong correlation between comprehension and reading, suggesting that the performance in the first reading significantly influenced the performance in the second reading, which also occurred for comprehension. CONCLUSION: The delay in the activities of naming, reading and comprehension in the first evaluation provoked failures in the phoneme-grapheme conversion that may be enough to cause learning difficulties in reading.(AU)"

Figures 5 and 8 were inadvertently printed in greyscale through a production related error. The correct color figures appear in this record.] The Common Core set a standard for all children to read increasingly complex texts throughout schooling. The purpose of the present study was to explore text characteristics specifically in relation to early-grades text complexity. Three hundred fifty primary-grades texts were selected and digitized. Twenty-two text characteristics were identified at 4 linguistic levels, and multiple computerized operationalizations were created for each of the 22 text characteristics. A researcher-devised text-complexity outcome measure was based on teacher judgment of text complexity in the 350 texts as well as on student judgment of text complexity as gauged by their responses in a maze task for a subset of the 350 texts. Analyses were conducted using a logical analytical progression typically used in machine-learning research. Random forest regression was the primary statistical modeling technique. Nine text characteristics were most important for early-grades text complexity including word structure (decoding demand and number of syllables in words), word meaning (age of acquisition, abstractness, and word rareness), and sentence and discourse-level characteristics (intersentential complexity, phrase diversity, text density/information load, and noncompressibility). Notably, interplay among text characteristics was important to explanation of text complexity, particularly for subsets of texts."

The research demonstrates that (a) for many children, mathematics difficulties are not stable over time; (b) the presence of reading difficulties seems related to slower progress in many aspects of mathematics; (c) almost all students with MD demonstrate problems with accurate and automatic retrieval of basic arithmetic combinations, such as 6 + 3. The following measures appear to be valid and reliable indicators of potential MD in kindergartners: (a) magnitude comparison (i.e., knowing which digit in a pair is larger), (b) sophistication of counting strategies, (c) fluent identification of numbers, and (d) working memory (as evidenced by reverse digit span). These are discussed in terms of the components of number sense. Implications for early intervention strategies are explored."

Through this it examined child and letter characteristics influencing the acquisition of alphabetic knowledge in a naturalistic context, the relationship between letter-sound knowledge and letter-name knowledge, and the prediction of Grade 1 phonological awareness and word identification from these variables. Knowledge of letter sounds was better for vowels and for letters with consonant–vowel names than for those with vowel–consonant names or names bearing little relationship to their sounds. However, there were anomalies within each category reflecting characteristics of the individual letters. Structural equation modelling showed that cognitive ability, comprising receptive vocabulary, non-verbal reasoning, rapid automatized naming of colours, and phonological memory significantly contributed to alphabetic knowledge and phonological awareness. In turn, letter-name knowledge but not phonological awareness predicted letter-sound knowledge and subsequent reading skill."

The combined results for the 16 intervention studies, representing 1,340 families, were clear: Parent involvement has a positive effect on children’s reading acquisition. Further analyses revealed that interventions in which parents tutored their children using specific literacy activities produced larger effects than those in which parents listened to their children read books. The three studies in which parents read to their children did not result in significant reading gains. When deciding which type of intervention to implement, educators will have to weigh a variety of factors such as the differences in effectiveness across the different types of intervention, the amount of resources needed to implement the interventions, and the reading level of the children."

There is a growing body of research into pedagogical change to improve literacy outcomes and the implementation of schoolwide approaches to teaching and learning, particularly within the context of school improvement. This article ties together these two threads through the powerful stories of two primary schools that had undertaken a long-term school improvement project. The evidence of their explicit teaching of literacy is examined through investigation of the ‘teacher talk’ that occurs in classroom interactions and professional conversations. The way this talk reflects teachers’ shared pedagogical practices, their use of metalanguage for learning and students’ engagement is exemplified. It shows how, in each case, the pedagogical dialogue and literacy learning is mutually used by teachers and students in their literacy practices."

The key element in this concept is the notion of a discrepancy between observed and expected level of development In DSM III- R and ICD 10. SDD serves as a conceptual umbrella, suggesting that the subsumed disorders are of the same type. In DSM-IV. the SDD umbrella is not used explicitly, but the notion of a discrepaney is present in the categories of Learning Disorders. Motor Skill Disorder and Communication Disorders, suggesting a close relationship between these disorders. One of the advantages of the use of SDD as a unifying concept is that ii contributes to the. standardisation of the description off the various disorders. However, bused on reviews of research regarding the reliability and validity of the SDD categories, we argue that the application of n unifying SDD concept has been premature. For each of the categories for disorders in scholastic skills, language, speech and motor coordination the notion of a discrepancy between observed find expected level of development should be elaborated and tested more thoroughly, before SDD can be used as a unifying concept in classification."

Children from low-SES and language minority homes have unique linguistic strengths, but many reach school age with lower levels of English language skill than do middle-class, monolingual children. Because early differences in English oral languageskill have consequences for academic achievement, low levels of English language skill constitute a deficit for children about to enter school in the United States. Declaring all developmental trajectories to be equally valid would not change the robust relation between English oral language skills and academic achievement and would not help children with poor English skills to be successful in school. Remedies aimed at supporting the development of the English skills required for academic success need not and should not entail devaluing or diminishing children’s other language skills."

Previous studies have documented that two important dimensions of heterogeneity are the presence of a comorbid language impairment (LI) and the persistence of SSD, but these factors have not been examined separately. Method: The current study used a 2 · 2 MANOVA design (with follow-up MANCOVAs) to examine how a comorbid language impairment (LI) and the persistence of SSD relate to pre-literacy skills in a sample of 5- to 6-year-old children with SSD. Results: Significant main effects for persistent SSD and LI were obtained, such that each factor was associated with worse performance on pre-literacy tasks, particularly those assessing phonological awareness (even with nonverbal IQ covaried). In addition, even SSD children with normalized speech without LI were found to have deficits on phonological awareness tasks relative to control participants.

In common with the SLI group, mean scores of children with mild-to-moderate hearing loss were significantly poorer on tests of phonological short-term memory, phonological discrimination, and phonological awareness than CA controls. No differences between group means were observed in SNH and CA control groups on vocabulary, digit and sentence recall, sentence comprehension, and literacy scores. However, there was considerable individual variation within the SNH group. Nearly 50% of the SNH group showed phonological impairment associated with poorer expressive and receptive vocabulary and higher hearing thresholds than remaining children without phonological impairment. Nonword repetition deficits were observed in SNH subgroups with and without phonological impairment and were of a similar magnitude to those observed in children with SLI. Indeed, poorer repetition in children with SLI could only be differentiated from children with SNH on phonologically complex nonwords. Overall, findings suggested major problems in nonword repetition and phonological impairment occurred without clinically significant deficits in wider language and literacy abilities in children with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss.

Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, 180 children from 15 UK nursery schools (n = 12 from each setting; Mage = 4;0) were randomly allocated to receive a 30-week oral language intervention or to a waiting control group. Children in the intervention group received 30 weeks of oral language intervention, beginning in nursery (preschool), in three group sessions per week, continuing with daily sessions on transition to Reception class (pre-Year 1). The intervention was delivered by nursery staff and teaching assistants trained and supported by the research team. Following screening, children were assessed preintervention, following completion of the intervention and after a 6-month delay. Results: Children in the intervention group showed significantly better performance on measures of oral language and spoken narrative skills than children in the waiting control group immediately after the 30 week intervention and after a 6 month delay. Gains in word-level literacy skills were weaker, though clear improvements were observed on measures of phonological awareness. Importantly, improvements in oral language skills generalized to a standardized measure of reading comprehension at maintenance test. Conclusions: Early intervention for children with oral language difficulties is effective and can successfully support the skills, which underpin reading comprehension.

Children from higher socioeconomic status households, females, and those experiencing higher quality parenting had larger oral vocabularies. Children born with very low birth weight or from households where the mother had health problems had smaller oral vocabularies. Even after extensive covariate adjustment, 24-month-old children with larger oral vocabularies displayed greater reading and mathematics achievement, increased behavioral self-regulation, and fewer externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors at kindergarten entry."

Burgess, Jason L. Anthony, Theodore A. Barker","This study examined phonological sensitivity in 238 children from middle- to upper-income families and 118 children from lower-income families across different levels of linguistic complexity. Children ranged in age from 2 to 5 years. Overall, the results indicated that as children increased in age, phonological sensitivity both increased in absolute terms and became more stable. Significant social class differences in growth of phonological sensitivity were also obtained. Phonological sensitivity at different levels of linguistic complexity (e.g., syllables, phonemes) was substantially interrelated at each age and predicted word reading ability in older children independently of language skills and letter knowledge. These results indicate that phonological sensitivity can be assessed in young preschool children and that lower levels of phonological sensitivity may serve as developmental precursors to higher levels of phonological sensitivity. The development of phonological processing is an important precursor to the acquisition of early reading skills (e.g., Adams, 1990; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987). Phonological processing refers to the use of phonological information (i.e., the sounds of one's language) in processing written and oral language. A growing body of research indicates that individual differences in one form of phonological processing, phonological sensitivity, are causally related to the normal acquisition of beginning reading (e.g., Bryant, MacLean, Bradley, & Crossland, 1990; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994). Children who are better at detecting and manipulating syllables, rhymes, or phonemes are quicker to learn to read, and this relation is present even after variability in reading skill due to factors such as IQ, receptive vocabulary, memory skills, and social class is partialed out (Bryant et al., 1990; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987; Wagner et al., 1994). The majority of evidence linking phonological sensitivity in prereaders with the development of reading has come from studies that have assessed children's phonological sensitivity at the point of school entry but prior to formal reading instruction. For example, Share, Jorm, MacLean, and Mathews (1984) found that children's phonological sensitivity, measured at the beginning of kindergarten with a phoneme segmentation task, was the single best predictor of"

Ninety-eight 6-year-old Turkish children, living in the Netherlands since infancy, were selected prior to their entrance into the first grade of primary school. A longitudinal design monitored the development of lexical, morphosyntactic, pragmatic, phonological, and literacy abilities in the children's first and second languages. To minimize test-bias, I developed linguistic tasks, which required minimal instruction, analyzing interdependence relationships in bilingual development with LISREL techniques. The results clearly show that at the level of lexicon and syntax, language transfer was quite limited. At the level of pragmatic skills, phonological skills, and literacy skills, however, positive evidence appeared for the interdependence in bilingual development."

Despite several attempts, no single component process (mediator) has been identified that fully accounts for the correlation. The present paper estimated the explanatory value of several mediators for the RAN–reading correlation. One hundred and sixty-nine preschool students were given measures of RAN and additional measures of phonological awareness, lexical search speed, letter knowledge and paired associate learning. Their reading skills were tested a year later along with speed of processing. The influence of the mediators on the RAN–reading correlation was estimated as indirect effects in mediation analyses. Phonological awareness and letter knowledge significantly mediated the RAN–reading relationship, each accounting for a moderate part of the correlation between RAN and reading fluency. Thus, the RAN–reading correlation was partly, but not fully, accounted for by precursors of reading that are currently known."

Capsoni, E. Rosso, A. Binda, A. Pirola, C. Conti, E. Gruppi, Giovanni Lanzi, S. Salini, C. Tognatti, M. Zoppello, U. Balottin","Background  The level of language development reached in pre-school age is considered the most reliable predictor of reading acquisition. In normally developing children, learning to read is strongly related to early language skills, and in particular to phonological processing abilities. In dyslexic children, reading abilities seem to show a correlation with phonological awareness.



Methods  A group of 65 children (aged 5–6 years) were recruited and submitted to an in-depth neuropsychological assessment [i.e. metaphonological skills, intelligence, verbal short-term memory (VSTM) and other aspects of receptive and expressive language]. We were able to identify 14 children with significant metaphonological difficulties (MD): 11 children with exclusively MD, and the other three children with specific language impairment. This study compares the neuropsychological profile obtained from children with MD with that of a peer group without any language impairment (N).



Results  The performances of the MD were within the normal ability range in almost all the administered tests but significantly lower compared with those of their peers without language impairment (N) in some items of the intelligence scale (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence) and in the tests of VSTM and of receptive/expressive language. Nevertheless, there were not statistically significant differences between MD and N in output phonology.



Conclusions  In pre-school age, in a group of non-clinical children, with a range of abilities, those with MD appear to be at the lower end of the normal range in many other verbal skills. These children could be considered at-risk for possible subsequent difficulties learning to read and thus need to be identified and to warrant prompt treatment."

Vellutino, Donna M. Scanlon, Haiyan Zhang, Christopher Schatschneider","Entry-level kindergartners in classrooms from five middle class school districts were given a test of letter identification and children who scored at or below the 30th percentile on the test were classified as “at risk” for early reading difficulties. Half of these children were randomly assigned to a project-based intervention condition where they received supplementary intervention in small groups until the end of their kindergarten year. The other half received whatever remedial services were available at their home schools and literacy skills development in both groups was tracked throughout kindergarten. All available at-risk children were again assessed at the beginning of first grade and dichotomized into a “continued-risk” group and a “no-longer-at-risk” group using a composite measure of basic word level skills. Normal reader controls were also identified using the same measure. Children in the continued-risk group received either project-based intervention (one-to-one tutoring 30 min daily) or school-based intervention throughout first grade. Intervention for project treatment children was discontinued at the end of first grade and literacy development in all groups was tracked until the end of third grade. The present study focused on literacy development in children who received only project-based kindergarten intervention or both (project-based) kindergarten and first grade intervention, relative to the normal reader controls. Of special interest was the question of whether measures of response to intervention would more effectively distinguish between continued-risk and no-longer-at-risk children than would kindergarten screening measures, measures of intelligence, or measures of reading-related cognitive abilities. Results indicated that the RTI measures more effectively and more consistently distinguished between these two groups than did the psychometric measures."

PA and RAN were moderately correlated with real-word reading (.48 and .46, respectively). Other findings were that (a) real-word reading was correlated best (r values were .60 to .80) with spelling and pseudoword reading, but correlations with RAN, PA, vocabulary, orthography, IQ, and memory measures were in the low-to-moderate range (.37 to .43); and (b) correlations between reading and RAN/PA varied minimally across age groups but were weaker in poor readers than in skilled readers. The results suggested that the importance of RAN and PA measures in accounting for reading performance has been overstated."

The sample consisted of 119 preschool children with language impairment. HLE was conceptualised as frequency of storybook reading and literacy teaching during book reading. Frequency of storybook reading was a unique predictor of print knowledge, which is consistent with research on children with typical language. Literacy teaching did not predict print knowledge, which diverges from research on children with typical language. No interactions between the HLE and child characteristics were significant, but language ability and print interest play a role in understanding individual differences in literacy development."

Findings are reported concerning two outcome measures at age 7: children's reading level, as determined by the difficulty level of their school reading book, and whether or not children at age 7 were judged to have literacy difficulties. Significant factors included having favourite books at age 3; letter knowledge and parents reading to children at school entry; and at age 7, access to home computers, and parents’ knowledge of literacy teaching in school. Children with literacy difficulties owned fewer books, were less likely to read to themselves or their parents, and generally had less support for literacy at home.

1213,2113341893,literacy for all in 100 days a research based strategy for fast progress in low income countries,2013,,,Helen Abadzi,"In low-income countries many students are marginalized very early and remain illiterate. In grades 1-3 they attend rarely, though they may officially drop out in grade 4. Many others graduate from primary school without having learned letter values. The worrisome outcomes, despite much donor investment in low-income countries, have prompted scrutiny of the methods, and textbooks used to make students literate. This document offers insights from cognitive neuroscience and evidence suggesting that students can be taught basic literacy within the first semester of grade 1, if taught in consistently spelled languages. Teaching students at risk of dropout to read as early as possible enhances equity. However, the reading methods used in many countries are complex and hard for teachers to execute. They pertain to high-income countries and to certain western European languages. English but also French, Portuguese, and Dutch have complex spelling systems. English in particular requires three years of learning time. (French requires about two). Reading instruction for English is expensive and complex. Lists of whole words must be learned, vocabulary and early training in predictions are needed in order to make sense of words that cannot be sounded out. Learning must be started at kindergarten, parents must help at home, and many weaker students require remedial instruction. Since English is an official language in many countries, the travails of learning to read in this language have been considered the normal fate of reading. Overall, reading methods must be resilient to the vicissitudes of implementation. Many activities work well in higher-income countries or small pilots, but at scale-up they sink. Governments and donors should train up to existing capacity, rather than try to raise capacity to the requirements of complex methods."

This study takes an alternative approach to examine the heterogeneity of developmental dyslexia using taxometric classification techniques. These methods were used with a large sample of 671 children ages 6–8 who were diagnosed with severe reading disorders. Latent characteristics of the sample are assessed in regard to posited subtypes with phonological deficits and naming speed deficits, thus extending prior work by addressing whether these deficits embody separate classes of individuals. Findings support separate taxa of dyslexia with and without phonological deficits. Different latent structure for naming speed deficits was found depending on the definitional criterion used to define dyslexia. Non-phonologically based forms of dyslexia showed particular difficulty with naming speed and reading fluency. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.



Practitioner Points

Support for separate subtypes of dyslexia, with and without phonological deficits (PDs), indicates a need for different approaches to intervention.
A discrepancy-based criterion identifies more non-PD cases that may be missed with a response-to-intervention diagnosis.
Sound symbol correspondence and decoding measures may best distinguish cases of dyslexia with and without PDs."

Bishop,"Data from two twin studies are examined to assess genetic and environmental influences on literacy, and the etiological relationship between language and literacy. Study 1 used children from 86 families previously recruited for a study of the genetics of specific language impairment (see Bishop, North, & Donlan, 1995), who completed tests of single-word reading and spelling. Literacy problems in this sample were common, were strongly heritable, and showed a close genetic relationship with poor nonword repetition. Study 2 included two subsets of children: 37 twin pairs who had taken part in study 1, 3 to 4 years earlier, and 100 twin pairs recruited from the general population by Bishop et al. (1999). All children were given a standardised test of nonword reading. There was no genetic influence on nonword reading ability, either across the normal range, or at the lower extreme, though there were significant associations with some social variables. However, bivariate DeFries-Fulker analysis suggested that in this study, as in study 1, there was shared genetic variance between poor nonword repetition and literacy deficits. It is concluded that poor nonword repetition, which is known to be highly heritable, puts the child at risk for literacy problems. However, in a general population sample, such as that included in study 2, poor nonword repetition is a relatively rare correlate of literacy problems, which are more likely to have an environmental origin. Thus the different pattern of results in the two studies can be explained if one assumes that genetic influences are substantial only when literacy problems are severe and/or accompanied by oral language difficulties."

Word decoding ability is a critical factor in reading performance. In the present study, we examined the relationship between word decoding ability and three different phonological skills; phonemic awareness, verbal short-term memory (V-STM), and rapid automatic naming (RAN) in 1007 Scandinavian third- and fifth-graders. In the first part of the study, we sought to investigate the influence of the three phonological skills on word decoding ability. Using multiple regression analysis, our result clearly demonstrated that phonemic awareness was the most powerful phonological skill explaining variance in word decoding ability among average decoders. Among children with poor decoding skills, however, RAN was the most important factor in Grade 3, whereas V-STM was the main contributor to decoding ability among children in Grade 5. In the second part of the research, we examined the relationship between poor phonological skills and word decoding ability. Interestingly, our result revealed that approximately one half of the children with phonological difficulties, still performed within the average range with regard to word decoding ability. However, our analyses confirmed earlier research concerning the severe word decoding difficulties children with both poor phonemic awareness and restricted V-STM, experience."

Students in 10 kindergarten classrooms in three elementary schools completed alternate forms of the CBM measure twice per month from January to May. Mathematics development was indexed on a standardized mathematics achievement test in May. Findings indicate strong reliability and validity of the CBM system, with coefficients exceeding .80 and .60, respectively. Technical features of the CBM system’s skills analysis suggest implications for teachers’ instructional decision-making."

The relationships among early phonological skills, letter knowledge, grammatical skills, and vocabulary knowledge were investigated as predictors of word recognition and reading comprehension. Word recognition skills were consistently predicted by earlier measures of letter knowledge and phoneme sensitivity (but not by vocabulary knowledge, rhyme skills, or grammatical skills). In contrast, reading comprehension was predicted by prior word recognition skills, vocabulary knowledge, and grammatical skills. The results are related to current theories about the role of phonological, grammatical, and vocabulary skills in the development of early reading skills."

Lombardino, Darrell Morris, Laurie Mercado, Frank DeFillipo, Carol Sarisky, Ann Montgomery","This study was designed to provide speech-language pathologists and educators with a method for identifying children at risk for reading failure. The Early Reading Screening Instrument (ERSI) was given to 149 end-of-the-year kindergarten children. Half of the sample was tested 1 year later with standardized reading measures. Total ERSI scores from the kindergarten children strongly correlated with reading skills in first grade. Reading comprehension in first grade was the skill most strongly predicted by the subjects' total ERSI scores. The word recognition and invented spelling subtests of the ERSI were the best variables to be selected as predictors of first grade word analysis, word identification, and passage comprehension skills. A split-half reliability study of the ERSI showed that a shortened form could be used with the same degree of predictive validity. The ERSI or similar tools can be used to assess reading readiness in kindergarten children so that we can promptly begin an intervention to prevent or, at the very least, to diminish risk for reading failure. For screening reading readiness across different languages or cultures, the content of the four ERSI subtests can easily be modified."

Booth","Fluent reading requires successfully mapping between visual orthographic and auditory phonological representations and is thus an intrinsically cross-modal process, though reading difficulty has often been characterized as a phonological deficit. However, recent evidence suggests that orthographic information influences phonological processing in typical developing (TD) readers, but that this effect may be blunted in those with reading difficulty (RD), suggesting that the core deficit underlying reading difficulties may be a failure to integrate orthographic and phonological information. Twenty-six (13 TD and 13 RD) children between 8 and 13 years of age participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment designed to assess the role of phonemic awareness in cross-modal processing. Participants completed a rhyme judgment task for word pairs presented unimodally (auditory only) and cross-modally (auditory followed by visual). For typically developing children, correlations between elision and neural activation were found for the cross-modal but not unimodal task, whereas in children with RD, no correlation was found. The results suggest that elision taps both phonemic awareness and cross-modal integration in typically developing readers, and that these processes are decoupled in children with reading difficulty."

The results indicate that the developmental relationships between all three abilities also exist in adults. Experiment 2 investigated the robustness of these results using different stimuli and a variant of the word-learning task, and it also examined performance in a visuospatial span task, to test an alternative account of the results of Experiment 1; the results from 58 adults provide further evidence that the developmental association between word-learning, nonword repetition, and immediate serial recall extends into adulthood.

Few studies have investigated orthographic processing in dyslexic children and it is not yet clear whether lexical and sublexical orthographic processing are both impaired in these children. The present study examined orthographic processing in dyslexic children (N = 19, below-average word reading as well as below average spelling skills, T-values <40) and typically developing children (N = 32) aged 8–10 years. Different aspects of orthographic processing were measured. Word-specific knowledge (lexical level) was assessed with an Orthographic Choice Task. General orthographic knowledge (sublexical level) was assessed with three pseudoword tasks. The Freq-Choice-Task is a choice task that measures children’s knowledge of frequent double consonants (e.g., nilemm–nilebb). The Pos-Choice-Task measures children’s knowledge about legal positions of double consonants (e.g., sinnum–ssinum). The Pos-Speed-Task measures children’s ability to identify orthographic irregularities in words presented singly (e.g., mmotin). Results show that dyslexic children are able to discriminate illegal/infrequent letter pattern from legal/frequent letter pattern. Seeing either a word with legal or illegal letter patterns singly (Pos-Speed-Task), dyslexic children show deficits in identifying illegal letter pattern as wrong, whereas they have no problems to identify legal letter pattern as correct. Furthermore, dyslexic children show a reduced word specific orthographic knowledge. Additionally, the present study demonstrated that word representations as well as sensitivity to legal letter pattern influence reading and spelling performance."

In Kindergarten, oral language (consisting of listening comprehension, syntax, and vocabulary) shared variance with phonological awareness in predicting a listening comprehension outcome. However, in Grades 1 and 2, phonological awareness was no longer predictive of reading comprehension when decoding fluency and oral language were included in the model. In Grades 1 and 2, oral language and decoding fluency were significant predictors of reading comprehension."

Results indicated differences between subgroups in growth trajectories that were evident in first grade. A large proportion of students with SI or LI did not meet grade-level reading fluency benchmarks. Overall students with SI showed better performance than students with LI. Reading fluency performance was negatively related to the persistence of the SI or LI; the lowest performing students were those originally identified with SI or LI whose diagnosis changed to a learning disability.

The goal of our study is to explore one route through which SES may influence children’s early literacy skills: informal conversations about letters. The study builds on previous studies (Robins, Treiman, & Rosales, 2014; Robins, Treiman, Rosales, & Otake, 2012; Robins & Treiman, 2009) that show how U. S. parents and their young children talk about writing and provides preliminary evidence about similarities and differences in parent–child conversations as a function of SES. Focusing on parents and children aged three to five, we conducted five separate analyses of these conversations, asking whether and how family SES influences the previously established patterns. Although we found talk about letters in both upper and lower SES families, there were differences in the nature of these conversations. The proportion of letter talk utterances that were questions was lower in lower SES families and, of all the letter names that lower SES families talked about, more of them were uttered in isolation rather than in sequences. Lower SES families were especially likely to associate letters with the child’s name, and they placed more emphasis on sequences in alphabetic order. We found no SES differences in the factors that influenced use of particular letter names (monograms), but there were SES differences in two-letter sequences (digrams). Focusing on the alphabet and on associations between the child’s name and the letters within it may help to interest the child in literacy activities, but they many not be very informative about the relationship between letters and words in general. Understanding the patterns in parent–child conversations about letters is an important first step for exploring their contribution to children’s early literacy skills and school readiness."

Each variable showed significant genetic and unique environment influences. Multivariate analyses revealed very high genetic correlations among the variables, indicating that the same genes are involved in their aetiology. These genes are partly independent of those contributing to intelligence. A further analysis indicated that the covariation between decoding and orthographic learning is mediated by shared genes rather than by a direct causal path. The authors argue that a learning parameter, most directly assessed by orthographic learning in this study, underlies all three literacy variables. The results are also discussed in relation to Share’s self-teaching hypothesis, which may require modification. In this article we report on a behaviour-genetic analysis of orthographic learning in Grade 2 children. We examine the genetic and environmental influences on it and on its relations with spelling achievement and decoding.

Liberman, Donald Shankweiler, F.William Fischer, Bonnie Carter","Abstract To write a language, one must first abstract the unit to be used from the acoustic stream of speech. Writing systems based on the meaningless units, syllables and phonemes, were late developments in the history of written language. The alphabetic system, which requires abstraction of the phonemic unit of speech, was the last to appear, evolved from a syllabary and, unlike the other systems, was apparently invented only once. It might therefore be supposed that phoneme segmentation is particularly difficult and more difficult, indeed, than syllable segmentation. Speech research suggests reasons why this may be so. The present study provides direct evidence of a similar developmental ordering of syllable and phoneme segmentation abilities in the young child. By means of a task which required preschool, kindergarten, and first-grade children to tap out the number of segments in spoken utterances, it was found that, though ability in both syllable and phoneme segmentation increased with grade level, analysis into phonemes was significantly harder and perfected later than analysis into syllables. The relative difficulties of the different units of segmentation are discussed in relation to reading acquisition."

Three different tasks were used: numeral reading, number word reading, and pseudoword reading. The pseudowords shared the letter patterns for onsets and rimes with the number words. The results showed that with the exception of English, pseudowords in the remaining orthographies were read with a high level of accuracy (approaching 90%) by the end of Grade 1. In contrast to accuracy, reading fluency for pseudowords was affected not only by regularity but also by other orthographic differences. The results highlight the need for a revision of English-based characterizations of reading development. The present study is an extension of Wimmer and Goswami’s (1994) comparative study of reading development in young English and German children. The main finding of Wimmer and Goswami was that 7-, 8-, and 9-year old English children had substantially more difficulties in a pseudoword reading task than German children did. Landerl’s (2000) replication supported Wimmer and Goswami’s (1994) findings: in comparison to English children, young German readers in first and second grade displayed a distinct advantage in their ability to read pseudowords with a high degree of accuracy. Another recent replication with a comparison of Spanish and Portuguese children was reported by Defior, Martos, and Cary (2002). Their results show that the pseudoword reading accuracy of Spanish and Portuguese children is relatively similar to the performance of German children and much better than that reported for English children in the aforementioned studies."

Mean comparisons revealed significantly lower preschool print knowledge in Scandinavia, consistent with the relatively lower amount of shared book reading and letter-based activities with parents, and lack of emphasis on print knowledge in Scandinavian preschools. The patterns of correlations between all preschool environment measures and prereading skills within the samples were remarkably similar, as were the patterns of genetic, shared environment, and non-shared environment estimates: in all samples, genetic influence was substantial and shared environment influence was relatively weak for phonological awareness, rapid naming, and verbal memory; genetic influence was weak, and shared environment influence was relatively strong for vocabulary and print knowledge. In contrast, for reading and spelling assessed at the end of kindergarten in the Australian and U.S. samples, there was some preliminary evidence for country differences in the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences. We argue that the apparently higher genetic and lower shared environment influence in the Australian sample was related to a greater emphasis on formal reading instruction, resulting in more advanced reading and spelling skills at the end of kindergarten, and thus there was greater opportunity to observe genetic influences on response to systematic reading instruction among the Australian twins."

A total of 86 children were tested in fall of kindergarten, spring kindergarten, and spring Grade 1 using an extensive battery of L1 predictor tests (in kindergarten) and L2 outcome tests (in Grade 1). Analyses of the kindergarten predictor scores revealed distinct underlying components, one related to reading and one to oral language. Further analyses revealed that phonological awareness, phonological access, and letter-sound knowledge in L1 were significant predictors of risk for reading difficulties in L2 while performance on L1 sentence repetition, phonological awareness, and tense marking tests in kindergarten were the best predictors of risk for L1 and L2 oral language difficulties. Both fall- and spring-kindergarten predictors predicted Grade 1 outcomes to a significant extent, with the spring-kindergarten predictors being more accurate. These results provide support for distinctive risk profiles for L2 oral language and reading difficulty and, furthermore, argue that assessment of L1 abilities can be used to make reasonably accurate predictions of later reading and/or oral language learning difficulties in L2 students."

In order to support the transition to literacy, and because oral language competence is important in its own right, it is vital that early-years teachers are skilled at identifying children who may be at risk of oral language impairment. In this study, 15 teachers completed the Children's Communication Checklist (second edition) on children in their first year of school (n = 149), and ratings were compared with results of screening using the Clinical Examination of Language Fundamentals Screening Test (fourth edition).

Beim gemeinsamen Auftreten von mehreren Risikobedingungen, wie es oft der Fall bei unter Armut lebenden Menschen ist, steigt die Risikobelastung und somit die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Entwicklungsbeeintrachtigungen (Laucht, Esser & Schmidt, 1998; Wustmann, 2004). In der vorliegenden Untersuchung wurde eine Stichprobe von Familien, die unter Armut leben (San Pedro, Ecuador), mit einer Stichprobe von Familien aus der Mittelschicht (Quito, Ecuador) verglichen. Es wurde gepruft, ob unterschiedlich viele Risikobedingungen vorliegen und ob sich Unterschiede in den sprachlichen Kompetenzen der Kinder sowie in der mutterlichen Feinfuhligkeit zeigen. Daruber hinaus wurde gepruft, ob Beziehungen zwischen der mutterlichen Feinfuhligkeit und den kommunikativen Kompetenzen bestehen. Die Ergebnisse weisen auf einen negativen Einfluss der Risikobedingungen auf den kindlichen Spracherwerb und auf die mutterlichen intuitiven und sensitiven Kompetenzen hin. Bei den Risikokindern zeigten die Ergebnisse ein Uberwiegen von Sprachentwicklungsverzogerungen bzw. -storungen. Die Mutter der Risikostichprobe wiesen ein geringeres Feinfuhligkeitsmas als die der Kontrollgruppe auf. Weiterhin zeigte sich ein Zusammenhang zwischen der mutterlichen Feinfuhligkeit und einzelnen kommunikativen Kompetenzbereichen.

Die Erhebung von Entwicklungsrisiken kann zur Pravention oder Intervention genutzt werden, die das Risiko negativer Konsequenzen reduzieren und positive Anpassung fordern. (DIPF/Orig.)
Risk factors can lead to disturbance of all areas of a childÂ’s development, and thus also of language acquisition and to problems in early relationships between parent and child. In the event of multiple risk factors, as it is often the case amongst people living in poverty, the burden of risks and therefore the probability of developmental disturbance rises (Laucht, Esser & Schmidt, 1998; Wustmann, 2004). In the present study a sample amongst families living in poverty (San Pedro, Ecuador) was compared with a sample taken from middle-class families (Quito, Ecuador). An examination was carried out whether there was a varying number of risk factors and whether there were differences in the language competence of the child as well as in the motherÂ’s sensitivity. There was a further examination of whether there was a correlation between maternal sensitivity and communicative competences. The results indicate a negative influence of risk conditions on the language acquisition of the children and on the intuitive and sensitive maternal competences. In the risk group, the results showed a preponderance of delays and disturbances in language development of the children. The mothers from the risk sample group displayed less sensitivity than the control group. There was also a correlation between maternal sensitivity and individual areas of competence. This study shows that it is necessary to ascertain the delays in childrenÂ’s language acquisition and mother-child interaction, particularly amongst families with serious burdens and multiple risk factors. Ascertaining these developmental risks can be used for prevention or intervention which can reduce the risk of negative consequences and aid positive adaptation. (DIPF/Orig.)"

Burke, Shanna Hagan-Burke, Yuanyuan Zou, Oi-man Kwok","The reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has initiated changes that are affecting early literacy assessment, and it has prompted the growing use of measures that incorporate phonological and alphabetic fluency. However, the question of how phonological and alphabetic fluency can inhibit (or promote) reading acquisition in kindergarten has received sparse attention. This study investigated phonological and alphabetic fluency as a predictor of emerging reading ability in kindergarten. Results indicated that a three-construct structural equation model could be developed. Moreover, an alphabetic construct, as formed from sublexical fluency measures administered at the middle of kindergarten, fully mediated the relationship between phonological fluency and end-of-year emerging reading ability. Implications are discussed in the context of reading acquisition."

The results support the hypothesis that parent-preschooler reading is related to outcome measures such as language growth, emergent literacy, and reading achievement. The overall effect size of d = .59 indicates that book reading explains about 8% of the variance in the outcome measures. The results support the hypothesis that book reading, in particular, affects acquisition of the written language register. The effect of parent-preschooler reading is not dependent on the socioeconomic status of the families or on several methodological differences between the studies. However, the effect seems to become smaller as soon as children become conventional readers and are able to read on their own."

Eleven kindergarten-age children with LI were then included as a comparison grade group to investigate whether the magnitude of treatment effect changed across grade level in the experimental group (K-3). Participants in the experimental group (Grades 1-3) made significantly greater gains in PA and reading (e.g., decoding and text comprehension) than the control group. Similar gains were observed across the varying grade levels (K-3). These results suggest that, despite being at risk of reading failure, school-age children with LI in Grades 1 through 3 have the potential to make accelerated gains in their reading development and in the PA skills that are essential to successful literacy acquisition."

In grades 1-3 they attend rarely, though they may officially drop out in grade 4. Many others graduate from primary school without having learned letter values. The worrisome outcomes, despite much donor investment in low-income countries, have prompted scrutiny of the methods, and textbooks used to make students literate. This document offers insights from cognitive neuroscience and evidence suggesting that students can be taught basic literacy within the first semester of grade 1, if taught in consistently spelled languages. Teaching students at risk of dropout to read as early as possible enhances equity. However, the reading methods used in many countries are complex and hard for teachers to execute. They pertain to high-income countries and to certain western European languages. English but also French, Portuguese, and Dutch have complex spelling systems. English in particular requires three years of learning time. (French requires about two). Reading instruction for English is expensive and complex. Lists of whole words must be learned, vocabulary and early training in predictions are needed in order to make sense of words that cannot be sounded out. Learning must be started at kindergarten, parents must help at home, and many weaker students require remedial instruction. Since English is an official language in many countries, the travails of learning to read in this language have been considered the normal fate of reading. Overall, reading methods must be resilient to the vicissitudes of implementation. Many activities work well in higher-income countries or small pilots, but at scale-up they sink. Governments and donors should train up to existing capacity, rather than try to raise capacity to the requirements of complex methods."

English appears to be the least consistent alphabetic orthography phonologically, and, consequently, children learn to read more slowly in English than in languages with more consistent orthographies. In this article, we report the first longitudinal evidence that the growth of reading skills is slower and follows a different trajectory in English than in two much more consistent orthographies (Spanish and Czech). Nevertheless, phoneme awareness, letter-sound knowledge, and rapid automatized naming measured at the onset of literacy instruction did not differ in importance as predictors of variations in reading development among the three languages.

First, we found impairments in phonological awareness, rapid naming, and letter knowledge in FR kindergartners with later dyslexia, and mild phonological-awareness deficits in FR kindergartners without subsequent dyslexia. These skills were better predictors of reading than arithmetic, except for rapid naming. Second, the literacy environment at home was comparable among groups. Third, having a dyslexic parent and literacy abilities of the non-dyslexic parent related to offspring risk of dyslexia. Parental literacy abilities might be viewed as indicators of offspring’s liability for literacy difficulties, since parents provide offspring with genetic and environmental endowment.

Consistent with the literature, it was found that intelligence does not differentiate between good and poor readers. The most important finding of the present study was that reader-group membership at Time 4 could be very accurately determined from students' Time 1 scores. All of the children in the RD and GV groups were correctly identified, and only 3 of the 148 ND children were misclassified, indicating that children at risk for reading dif..."

Pitchford, Neil Marlow","Aim To study the impact of specific neuropsychological measures on academic attainment in very preterm (VPT) children.

Methods VPT children (gestational age <31 weeks, N=48) and matched term controls (N=17) aged 9–10 years were assessed with measures of processing speed, executive function and IQ. Teachers reported on academic achievement in a questionnaire.

Results Group differences in academic attainment were significant for maths (OR 6.5; 95% CI 1.7 to 25.8), English/literacy (OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 13.5), overall academic attainment (OR 11.9; 95% CI 1.4 to 96.9) and special educational needs provision (OR 7.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 35.0). All significant group differences in attainment could be accounted for by processing speed. Birth group, processing speed and working memory were significant predictors of overall attainment ( R 2=0.57; p<0.001).

Conclusions Processing speed and working memory are important factors underlying academic attainment in VPT children. Specific tests of processing speed and working memory, which together take approximately only 10 min to administer, could potentially be used as efficient screening instruments to assess which children are at risk of educational problems and should be referred for a full neuropsychological assessment."

Pentimonti, Kimberly A. Murphy, Laura M. Justice, Jessica A. R. Logan, Joan N. Kaderavek","Background: School readiness generally captures the notion that children do best when they arrive at formal schooling with a certain threshold of skill that will help them thrive in the classroom's academic and social milieu.

Aims: To examine the dimensionality of the construct of school readiness among children with language impairment (LI), as well as the extent to which these dimensions relate to children's end-of-kindergarten literacy skills.

Methods & Procedures: Participants were 136 preschool-aged children with LI. Children were assessed on measures of pre-literacy, social, and behavioural skills in preschool and reading and spelling in kindergarten.

Outcomes & Results: Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that school readiness for this sample of children with LI is best characterized as two dimensions: pre-literacy and socio-emotional. Of the two dimensions, pre-literacy readiness was predictive of children's future performance in reading and spelling.

Conclusions & Implications: The results further our theoretical understanding of the dimensions of school readiness, as well as our knowledge of how these skills are related among children with LI. Identifying domain-specific readiness skills that are predictive of kindergarten success can help to identify means of early assessment and targets for speech–language intervention."

However, the development of English language acquisition may be different for ELL students. The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive role of English letter naming fluency, initial sound fluency, and vocabulary skills at the time of kindergarten entry for first grade English oral reading fluency and to examine the variability in language and literacy skills of ELL students by their demographic characteristics. The data for this study came from the Progress Monitoring and Reporting Network (PMRN), and were collected from Florida's Reading First schools. Letter Naming Fluency, Initial Sound Fluency, and Oral Reading Fluency components of Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were used as measures. Hierarchical Linear Modeling was used to analyze the curvilinear growth of ELL students’ first grade oral reading fluency. The results of this study revealed that kindergarten English letter naming fluency was the best predictor and vocabulary skills were the second best predictor of oral reading fluency in the first grade, followed by initial sound fluency. On average, male ELL students compared to female ELL students, ELL students eligible for free or reduced price lunch eligibility (FRPL) compared to those not eligible for FRPL, and Hispanic ELL students compared to White ELL students read fewer words at the beginning of the first grade and showed a slower growth rate. English oral reading fluency scores of Asian ELL students were the highest."

McCandliss, Martha J. Farah","Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with childhood cognitive achievement. In previous research we found that this association shows neural specificity; specifically we found that groups of low and middle SES children differed disproportionately in perisylvian/language and prefrontal/executive abilities relative to other neurocognitive abilities. Here we address several new questions: To what extent does this disparity between groups reflect a gradient of SES-related individual differences in neurocognitive development, as opposed to a more categorical difference? What other neurocognitive systems differ across individuals as a function of SES? Does linguistic ability mediate SES differences in other systems? And how do specific prefrontal/executive subsystems vary with SES? One hundred and fifty healthy, socioeconomically diverse first-graders were administered tasks tapping language, visuospatial skills, memory, working memory, cognitive control, and reward processing. SES explained over 30% of the variance in language, and a smaller but highly significant portion of the variance in most other systems.

A national internet forum for parents of children with ASD was selected out of other similar forums from six English speaking countries. Information about the angry episodes of 121 children with ASD as described by 120 parents on this forum was analysed. From the parents’ perspective, children with ASD were angry frequently with aggressive behaviours, their anger was target and context specific, and they could not control their own behaviours during their angry episodes but some were apologetic afterward. These behaviours impacted on the whole family, their parents, their siblings and the children with ASD. These episodes were influenced by their being physically or emotionally unwell, and antecedents included inaccessibility to preferred items, and changes in routines/environments. There might be improvement over time and possible gender difference in these behaviours."

This paper reviews these hypotheses and concludes that the proposed causal chains between the presumed auditory processing deficits and the observed behavioural manifestation of the disorders are vague and not well established empirically. Several problems and limitations are identified. Most data concern correlations between distantly related tasks, and there is considerable heterogeneity and variability in performance as well as concerns about reliability and validity. Little attention is paid to the distinction between ostensibly perceptual and metalinguistic tasks or between implicit and explicit modes of performance, yet measures are assumed to be pure indicators of underlying processes or representations. The possibility that diagnostic categories do not refer to causally and behaviourally homogeneous groups needs to be taken seriously, taking into account genetic and neurodevelopmental studies to construct multiple-risk models. To make progress in the field, cognitive models of each task must be specified, including performance domains that are predicted to be deficient versus intact, testing multiple indicators of latent constructs and demonstrating construct reliability and validity."

The extraneous cognitive requirements inherent in the tasks varied widely. The children’s performance on three tasks that involved a rhyming response was at ceiling, and these tasks did not correlate with subsequent reading progress. The other seven measures were all moderately related to later reading ability and, employed in sets, were very strong predictors. The relative predictive accuracy of the phonological tasks was equal to or better than more global measures of cognitive skills such as an intelligence test and a reading readiness test. The phonological tasks had a large amount of common variance. Factor analysis revealed only one factor on which all the nonrhyming phonological tasks loaded highly. The results bolster the construct validity of phonological awareness, indicate considerable comparability and interchangeability among the tasks used to measure the construct, and are encouraging as regards the possible use of such tasks in predictive test batteries."

Communication skills are a necessity both in the academic and social atmosphere of the school environment. Unfortunately, there are a large number of children in the schools today identified with speech and language disorders. This special edition of Psychology in the Schools examined issues that impact the academic and social functioning of such children. Several articles are focused on potential early intervention strategies or services surrounding literacy and social skills that may enhance the success of children with communication disorders and/or at risk for communication disorders (e.g., Chapman, Denning, & Jamison, 2008; Thatcher & Fletcher, 2008; van Kleeck, 2008). Two other articles tackle promising strategies that may be used in academic settings with children who stutter (Logan, Mullins, & Jones, 2008) or with children with cognitive impairments (Gillette & DePompei, 2008). Despite promising avenues of intervention and practice, there are also barriers to providing instruction to children with communication disorders in a regular classroom (Pufpaff, 2008).

Of these children, more than 21% received services for speech and language disorders; this percentage does not include children who have communication problems secondary to other conditions. Children with communication disorders may experience difficulty with academic and social experiences in the school environment. Traditional intervention has addressed the communication disorder as an isolated issue, not accounting for the far-reaching effects that children may experience. However, many practitioners and researchers now understand the role of communication and its relationship to success in school (Blachman, 1984; Catts, 1993; Fey, Catts, & Larrivee, 1995; Lewis & Freebairn, 1992). This special issue of Psychology in the Schools was designed with the goal of addressing the needs of children identified with communication disorders in the schools through a multidisciplinary approach. Children with communication disorders may need the direct services of the speech-language pathologist (SLP), but there is a need for all professionals who work in the schools to understand the academic, social, and psychological issues that may accompany communication disorders.

Snowling","Developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI) were for many years treated as distinct disorders but are now often regarded as different manifestations of the same underlying problem, differing only in severity or developmental stage. The merging of these categories has been motivated by the reconceptualization of dyslexia as a language disorder in which phonological processing is deficient. The authors argue that this focus underestimates the independent influence of semantic and syntactic deficits, which are widespread in SLI and which affect reading comprehension and impair attainment of fluent reading in adolescence. The authors suggest that 2 dimensions of impairment are needed to conceptualize the relationship between these disorders and to capture phenotypic features that are important for identifying neurobiologically and etiologically coherent subgroups. Specific language impairment (SLI) and developmental dyslexia (also known as specific reading disability; SRD) are common developmental disorders that have a serious impact on a child’s educational and psychosocial outcome. SLI affects around 3%– 10% of children (Tomblin et al., 1997) and is diagnosed when oral language lags behind other areas of development for no apparent reason (L. B. Leonard, 1998). Similar prevalence levels are reported for developmental dyslexia, which is identified if a child has poor literacy skills despite adequate intelligence and opportunity to learn (Snowling, 2000). In both SLI and dyslexia, the diagnostic criteria specify that the child has to have adequate hearing and no major handicapping condition that might interfere with learning. For many years, research on these two disorders followed separate paths, with the study of SLI being largely carried out by speech and language pathologists, whereas dyslexia was the focus of educators and psychologists. In the 1960s dyslexia was frequently conceptualized as a visual perceptual disorder. However, over the past 30 years, there has been a shift of emphasis, with growing recognition that most children with dyslexia have major difficulties in phonological processing, that is, categorizing speech sounds and relating these to orthography (Snowling, 1987; Vellutino, 1987)."

We therefore investigated the cognitive dynamics of reading fluency of different word types in Grades 1--4 in three orthographies differing in degree of transparency (Hungarian, Dutch, and Portuguese). The overall results showed that the relative strength of the contributions of phonological awareness and rapid naming to word reading fluency shifted as a function of reading expertise: The contribution of phonological awareness remained significant in all grades but decreased as a function of grade, whereas the contribution of rapid naming increased. Orthographic depth systematically modulated the strength of the cognitive contributions to reading, but not the overall developmental pattern. Together, these results indicate that the cognitive development of reading skill is fairly universal (at least for alphabetic scripts) and that differences in orthographic depth will not recruit different cognitive processes but will mainly be expressed in rate of reading development"

This causes primary problems in word decoding and spelling, and, as a consequence, also in reading comprehension. This is in accordance with the widely accepted reading model, which regards decoding as a prerequisite for reading comprehension. In this paper, we will discuss the relevance of these definitions, and the reading model they are based on, using data from a longitudinal study of readers who were diagnosed as being language-impaired when they were pre-schoolers. This group will be compared with a control group having no history of language impairments and also with groups of adolescent and adult dyslexics."

However the reasons why RAN speed discriminates DD from typical readers are not yet fully understood. Our study was aimed to identify some of the cognitive mechanisms underlying RAN-reading relationship by comparing one group of 32 children with DD with an age-matched control group of typical readers on a naming and a visual recognition task both using a discrete-trial methodology , in addition to a serial RAN task, all using the same stimuli (digits and colors). Results showed a significant slowness of DD children in both serial and discrete-trial naming tasks regardless of type of stimulus, but no difference between the two groups on the discrete-trial recognition task. Significant differences between DD and control participants in the RAN task disappeared when performance in the discrete-trial naming task was partialled out by covariance analysis for colors, but not for digits. The same pattern held in a subgroup of DD subjects with a history of early language delay (LD). By contrast, in a subsample of DD children without LD the RAN deficit was specific for digits and disappeared after slowness in discrete-trial naming was partialled out. Slowness in discrete-trial naming was more evident for LD than for noLD DD children. Overall, our results confirm previous evidence indicating a name-retrieval deficit as a cognitive impairment underlying RAN slowness in DD children. This deficit seems to be more marked in DD children with previous LD. Moreover, additional cognitive deficits specifically associated with serial RAN tasks have to be taken into account when explaining deficient RAN speed of these latter children. We suggest that partially different cognitive dysfunctions underpin superficially similar RAN impairments in different subgroups of DD subjects."

We present the results from a 3-year longitudinal study. RAN, measured with nonalphabetic stimuli before reading instruction has begun, is a predictor of later growth in reading fluency. After reading instruction has started, RAN continues to exert an influence on the development of reading fluency over the next 2 years. However, there is no evidence of a reciprocal influence of reading fluency on the growth of RAN skill. We suggest that RAN taps the integrity of left-hemisphere object-recognition and naming circuits that are recruited to function as a critical component of the child's developing visual word-recognition system."

The results indicated that phonological awareness ability assessed during kindergarten (via the Auditory Analysis Test) was a significant predictor of word identification and spelling skills 11 years later, when both socioeconomic status and vocabulary development were controlled. In contrast, socioeconomic status, vocabulary development, word recognition, and spelling achievement assessed at kindergarten were not significantly correlated with reading and spelling achievement 11 years later. Results are discussed regarding the relative stability of phonological awareness and the importance of this awareness as a precursor to the development of word identification and spelling skills."

Ford, Sonia Q. Cabell, Timothy R. Konold, Marcia Invernizzi, Lauren B. Gartland","This study explored heterogeneity in literacy development among 2,300 Hispanic children receiving English as a Second Language (ESL) services at the start of kindergarten. Two research questions guided this work: (1) Do Spanish-speaking English language learners receiving ESL services in the fall of kindergarten demonstrate homogeneous early literacy skills, or are there distinct patterns of achievement across measures of phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, and orthography? and (2) if there are distinct profiles, to what extent do they predict literacy achievement at the end of kindergarten and the beginning of first grade? Using cluster analysis, the authors identified four distinct literacy profiles derived from fall kindergarten measures of phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, and phonetic spelling. These profiles were found to be associated with literacy outcomes in spring of kindergarten and fall of first grade. The two profiles that were associated with greater success on later measures of concept of word in text, letter sound knowledge, word reading, and spelling were the two that included stronger performance on orthographic skills (i.e., alphabet knowledge and phonetic spelling). These findings demonstrated that there is heterogeneity among Hispanic ESL students at kindergarten entry and suggested that literacy instruction must be differentiated from the very beginning in order to meet students’ individual needs. The findings also suggested that orthographic skills should be assessed and taught early on. While phonological awareness may be a necessary precursor to reading, phonological awareness in the absence of orthographic skills may not be sufficient."

Correspondingly, developmental dyslexia is characterized by different behavioral manifestations across languages varying in orthographic depth. This review focuses on the question of whether these different behavioral manifestations are associated with different functional neuroanatomical manifestations. It provides a review and critique of cross-linguistic brain imaging studies of developmental dyslexia. In addition, it includes an analysis of state-of-the-art functional neuroanatomical models of developmental dyslexia together with orthography-specific predictions derived from these models. These predictions should be tested in future brain imaging studies of typical and atypical reading in order to refine the current neurobiological understanding of developmental dyslexia, especially with respect to orthography-specific and universal aspects."

Clark, Glenn D. Rosen, Paula Tallal, R. Holly Fitch","Individuals with developmental language disabilities, including developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI), exhibit impairments in processing rapidly presented auditory stimuli. It has been hypothesized that these deficits are associated with concurrent deficits in speech perception and, in turn, impaired language development. Additionally, postmortem analyses of human dyslexic brains have revealed the presence of focal neocortical malformations such as cerebrocortical microgyria. In an initial study bridging these research domains, we found that male rats with induced microgyria were impaired in discriminating rapidly presented auditory stimuli. In order to further assess this anatomical– behavioral association, we designed two experiments using auditory-reflex modification. These studies were intended to assess whether auditory processing deficits in microgyric male rats would be seen in threshold detection of a silent gap in white noise, and in oddball detection of a two-tone stimulus of variable duration. Results showed no differences between sham and microgyric subjects on gap detection, but did show that microgyric subjects were impaired in the discrimination of two-tone stimuli presented in an oddball paradigm. This impairment was evident for stimuli with total duration of 64 msec or less, while both groups were able to discriminate stimuli with duration of 89 msec or greater. The current results further support the relationship between malformations of the cerebral cortex and deficits in rapid auditory processing. They also suggest that the parameters characterizing rapid auditory processing deficits for a specific task may be influenced by stimulus features and/or cognitive demand of that particular task."

Measures were administered in kindergarten (before the start of formal reading instruction), in first and in third grade. Children, diagnosed with dyslexia in third grade, showed impaired phonological awareness (PA), verbal short-term memory, and rapid automatic naming ability (RAN) at all time points, with the deficit in PA aggravating over time. These children also performed more poorly in letter knowledge, word and nonword reading accuracy and speed, and spelling at each time point. Children at family risk of dyslexia who did not fulfil criteria for dyslexia, scored more poorly than low-risk controls on the literacy and phonological measures that required the most fine-grained phonological representations. This suggests that the family risk of dyslexia is continuous rather than discrete. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that PA and RAN were initially the most important instigators of reading accuracy and reading speed, respectively. After 2 years of reading instruction, only RAN predicted reading speed and accuracy. Letter knowledge, reading accuracy, and reading speed also contributed to the development of PA."

Ziegler, Usha Goswami","The development of reading depends on phonological awareness across all languages so far studied. Languages vary in the consistency with which phonology is represented in orthography. This results in developmental differences in the grain size of lexical representations and accompanying differences in developmental reading strategies and the manifestation of dyslexia across orthographies. Differences in lexical representations and reading across languages leave developmental “footprints” in the adult lexicon. The lexical organization and processing strategies that are characteristic of skilled reading in different orthographies are affected by different developmental constraints in different writing systems. The authors develop a novel theoretical framework to explain these cross-language data, which they label a psycholinguistic grain size theory of reading and its development."

The link between phonological awareness and literacy in typically developing and literacy delayed children is well established, but there is less research specifically into children with an isolated speech disorder (i.e. with age-appropriate language skills). There is a clinical need for clarification on their likely outcome as a group and for a means of predicting those individuals who might need support in literacy development. Aims: To assess literacy and phonological awareness skills at age 6;6‐7;6 years in children with a history of speech disorder, and to identify factors in their early profile that were predictive of later achievement. Methods & Procedures: Thirty-five children who had participated in an earlier therapy research study agreed to further assessment of their speech, language and literacy abilities. The children had originally been recruited between the ages of 3;6 and 5;0 years as having a moderate-to-severe speech disorder, and there were measures at that time of their non-verbal, language, phonological output and phonological awareness abilities. Follow-up assessments of phonological awareness, speech and early literacy were undertaken. Outcomes & Results: As a group, the children had made good progress in speech and showed phonological awareness and literacy development at an ageappropriate level. However, a small number of children had phonological awareness and literacy delay. Phonological awareness at 3;6‐5;0 years was the best predictor of literacy achievement. Conclusions: Speech and language therapists can be confident about the early literacy achievement of most children with isolated speech disorder, but should undertake assessment of phonological awareness to identify those children whose phonological awareness skills after speech intervention continue to be low."

The way in which discoveries in molecular genetics are reported can be misleading, encouraging us to think that there are specific genes that might be used to screen for disorder. However, dyslexia is not a classic Mendelian disorder that is caused by a mutation in a single gene. Rather, like many other common disorders, it appears to involve combined effects of many genes and environmental factors, each of which has a small influence, possibly supplemented by rare variants that have larger effects but apply to only a minority of cases. Furthermore, to see clearer relationships between genotype and phenotype, we may need to move beyond the clinical category of dyslexia to look at underlying cognitive deficits that may be implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders."

Phonological ability, speech perception and low-level auditory processing were assessed in a group of 5-year-old pre-school children at high-family risk for dyslexia, compared to a group of wellmatched low-risk control children. Based on family risk status and first grade literacy achievement children were categorized in groups and pre-school data were retrospectively reanalyzed. On average, children showing both increased family risk and literacy-impairment at the end of first grade, presented significant pre-school deficits in phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, speech-in-noise perception and frequency modulation detection. The concurrent presence of these deficits before receiving any formal reading instruction, might suggest a causal relation with problematic literacy development. However, a closer inspection of the individual data indicates that the core of the literacy problem is situated at the level of higher-order phonological processing. Although auditory and speech perception problems are relatively over-represented in literacy-impaired subjects and might possibly aggravate the phonological and literacy problem, it is unlikely that they would be at the basis of these problems. At a neurobiological level, results are interpreted as evidence for dysfunctional processing along the auditory-to-articulation stream that is implied in phonological processing, in combination with a relatively intact or inconsistently impaired functioning of the auditory-to-meaning stream that subserves auditory processing and speech perception. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The current study employed latent variable modeling of decoding fluency, vocabulary, syntax, and reading comprehension so as to represent these constructs with minimal error and to examine whether residual variance unaccounted for by oral language can be captured by specific factors of syntax and vocabulary. A 1-, 3-, 4-, and bifactor model were tested with 1,792 students in 18 schools in 2 large urban districts in the Southeast. Students were individually administered measures of expressive and receptive vocabulary, syntax, and decoding fluency in mid-year. At the end of the year students took the state reading test as well as a group-administered, norm-referenced test of reading comprehension. The bifactor model fit the data best in all 7 grades and explained 72% to 99% of the variance in reading comprehension. The specific factors of syntax and vocabulary explained significant unique variance in reading comprehension in 1 grade each. The decoding fluency factor was significantly correlated with the reading comprehension and oral language factors in all grades, but, in the presence of the oral language factor, was not significantly associated with the reading comprehension factor. Results support a bifactor model of lexical knowledge rather than the 3-factor model of the Simple View of Reading, with the vast amount of variance in reading comprehension explained by a general oral language factor."

Participants were 3–7-year olds enrolled in speech/language therapy ( N  = 185). Factor analysis of an extensive battery of speech and language measures provided support for two distinct factors, representing the skill dimensions of articulation/phonology and semantic/syntactic skills. To validate these factors, 38 of the children were followed to school age to re-evaluate speech and language skills and assess reading/spelling achievement. The validity of the two factors was supported by their differential associations with school-age reading and spelling achievement, persistence of SSD, and affection status in family members. A closer relationship of the family member to the proband and male gender predicted higher odds of a disorder. The findings suggest that articulation/phonology and language abilities are at least partially independent in children with SSD and that these constructs have distinct clinical and biological correlates. Learning outcomes The reader will develop knowledge about subtypes of speech sound disorders, understand the relationship between early speech sound disorders and later reading and spelling difficulties, and obtain information concerning familial transmission of speech sound disorders."

We examined (a) the contribution of phonological awareness to facilitating letter-sound acquisition from letter names and (b) the probabilities of letter-sound acquisition as a function of letter characteristics (i.e., consonant-vowel letters, vowe-consonant letters, letters with no sound cues, and vowel letters). The results show that letter-name knowledge had a large impact on letter-sound acquisition. Phonological awareness had a larger effect on letter-sound knowledge when letter names were known than when letter names were unknown. Furthermore, students were more likely to know the sounds of consonant-vowel letters (e.g., b and d) than vowel-consonant letters (e.g., l and m) and letters with no sound cues (e.g., h and y) when the letter name was known and phonological awareness was accounted for. Sounds were least likely to be known for letters with no sound cues, but reliable differences from other groups of letters depended on students' levels of phonological awareness and letter-name knowledge."

Wagner, Joseph K. Torgesen, Carol A. Rashotte, Steve A. Hecht, Theodore A. Barker, Stephen R. Burgess, John Donahue, Tamara Garon","Relations between phonological processing abilities and word-level reading skills were examined in a longitudinal correlational study of 216 children. Phonological processing abilities, word-level reading skills, and vocabulary were assessed annually from kindergarten through 4th grade, as the children developed from beginning to skilled readers. Individual differences in phonological awareness were related to subsequent individual differences in word-level reading for every time period examined. Individual differences in serial naming and vocabulary were related to subsequent individual differences in word-level reading initially, but these relations faded with development. Individual differences in letter-name knowledge were related to subsequent individual differences in phonological awareness and serial naming, but there were no relations between individual differences in wordlevel reading and any subsequent phonological processing ability. Phonological processing refers to using the phonological or sound structure of oral language when one processes oral and written language (Jorm & Share, 1983; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987). Spoken words represent combinations of basic sounds or phonemes. In English, for example, there are roughly 30 to 45 basic phonemes, depending on the classification system that is used. Of the nearly infinite number of possible combinations of phonemes, only a relatively small number actually occur, and most combinations of phonemes occur in multiple words. Thus, bat and cat each contain 3 phonemes, the latter 2 of which are shared. This fact is represented by their spellings, which have different initial letters and identical medial and final letters because the spellings in alphabetic orthographies such as English represent sound as well as meaning. Developmental and individual differences in phonological processing abilities appear to be related to the acquisition of reading skills, although the direction, magnitudes, and underlying mechanisms responsible for such relations have yet to be established (Brady & Shankweiler, 1991; Gough, Ehri, & Treiman, 1992; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994).

Segmentation displayed the weakest correlation with reading and accounted for no statistical variance in reading beyond what was found in the blending test.

Children's uppercase and lowercase letter-naming abilities were assessed at the end of preschool, and their literacy achievement on 3 standardized measures was assessed at the end of 1st grade. Diagnostic indices (sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive power) were generated to examine the extent to which attainment of various preschool letter-naming benchmarks was associated with later risk for literacy difficulties. Results indicated generally high negative predictive power for benchmarks requiring children to know 10 or more letter names by the end of preschool. Balancing across all diagnostic indices, optimal benchmarks of 18 uppercase and 15 lowercase letter names were identified. These findings are discussed in terms of educational implications, limitations, and future directions."

Vallet, Annie Magnan, Jean Ecalle","Institut Universitaire de France, Paris, FranceSummary: This study aims at identifying the effect of training in the acquisition of the alphabetic principle in 5-year-old children.We compared the effect of multisensory training of letters in visual, haptic, graphomotor, visuo-haptic, and visuo-graphomotorgroups. For each training type, we contrasted trained versus untrained letters in reading and spelling tasks. First, visuo-hapticand visuo-graphomotor training improved letter-sound correspondence acquisition scores more than the other types of training,and this improvement persisted in the second post-test. A cross-modal transfer was revealed by the fact that scores increased afterblindfold haptic and graphomotor experiences. Moreover, performance on untrained letters also improved, suggesting an indirecteffect following the speciﬁc trained letters training. The results argue in favor of a facilitating effect of multisensory encoding onacquisition of the alphabetic principle. Practical implications for the prevention of future reading difﬁculties are discussed.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

A total of 216 children including 118 with a preschool background were tested at the start of first grade and again approximately eight months later. The Basic Skills Assessment Tool for reading and writing (BASAT) was applied at both measurements. Basic skills at the start of first grade were not better when children had been to preschool but did predict academic success in first grade. Multilevel regression analysis revealed that preschool even had a negative effect on reading and writing at the end of first grade when we controlled for basic literacy skills at the start of first grade. We discuss the use of English in preschool as a possible explanation for the negative effects of preschool.

Frost, William Einar Mencl, Robert K. Fulbright, Nicole Landi, Elena L. Grigorenko, Leslie K. Jacobsen, Kenneth R.

However, the neural mechanisms associated with the relative advantages of early communication success, or the disadvantages of having delayed language development, are not well explored. In this study, 174 elementary school-age children whose parents reported that they started forming sentences ‘early’, ‘on-time’ or ‘late’ were evaluated with standardized measures of language, reading and spelling. All oral and written language measures revealed consistent patterns for ‘early’ talkers to have the highest level of performance and ‘late’ talkers to have the lowest level of performance. We report functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a subset of early, on-time and late talkers matched for age, gender and performance intelligence quotient that allows evaluation of neural activation patterns produced while listening to and reading real words and pronounceable non-words. Activation in bilateral thalamus and putamen, and left insula and superior temporal gyrus during these tasks was significantly lower in late talkers, demonstrating that residual effects of being a late talker are found not only in behavioural tests of oral and written language, but also in distributed cortical-subcortical neural circuits underlying speech and print processing. Moreover, these findings suggest that the age of functional language acquisition can have long-reaching effects on reading and language behaviour, and on the corresponding neurocircuitry that supports linguistic function into the school-age years."

Most previous studies of this process have examined English, focusing on variations in the phonetic iconicity of letter names as a reason why some letter sounds (such as that of b, where the sound is at the beginning of the letter’s name) are easier to learn than others (such as that of w, where the sound is not in the name). The present study examined Hebrew, where variations in the phonetic iconicity of letter names are minimal. In a study of 391 Israeli children with a mean age of 5 years, 10 months, we used multilevel models to examine the factors that are associated with knowledge of letter sounds. One set of factors involved letter names: Children sometimes attributed to a letter a consonant–vowel sound consisting of the first phonemes of the letter’s name. A second set of factors involved contrast: Children had difficulty when there was relatively little contrast in shape between one letter and others. Frequency was also important, encompassing both child-specific effects, such as a benefit for the first letter of a child’s forename, and effects that held true across children, such as a benefit for the first letters of the alphabet. These factors reflect general properties of human learning."

This study examines the usefulness of these assessments in kindergarten and 2nd grade. Method: Measures of phonological awareness and letter identification were administered in kindergarten, and measures of phonological awareness, phonetic decoding (i.e., nonword reading), and word reading were administered in 2nd and 4th grades to a sample of 570 children participating in a longitudinal study of reading and language impairments. Results: A path analysis indicated that kindergarten measures of phonological awareness and letter identifi cation provided information to the prediction of 2nd-grade reading. In 2nd grade, measures of reading offered information to the prediction of 4th-grade reading. Additionally, a reciprocal relationship was found between phonological awareness and word reading, with kindergarten phonological awareness predicting 2nd-grade word reading and, conversely, 2nd-grade word reading predicting 4th-grade phonological awareness. Clinical Implications: Phonological awareness assessment provides information about reading in kindergarten but loses its predictive power at 2nd grade. At that time, phonological awareness and word reading become so highly correlated that phonological awareness does not add information to the prediction of 4th-grade reading."

Frequency refers to the number of shared reading sessions conducted each week as measured by teachers’ written reading logs recorded across the academic year. Features refers to teachers’ extratextual talk about literal, inferential, or print or phonological topics as assessed by analysis of 6 videotaped readings of narrative and informational texts collected across the preschool year. Participants were 28 preschool teachers and 178 children. The children were largely at risk and randomly selected from among those in each classroom to complete longitudinal assessments. In preschool, results showed that the frequency of classroom shared reading was positively and significantly related to children’s receptive vocabulary growth, as was the inclusion of extratextual conversations around the text; only extratextual conversations related to children’s preschool literacy growth. There was no evidence of differential influences of these experiences for children; that is, the relationship between frequency or features and children’s language and literacy development was not moderated by children’s initial skill level. Longitudinally, extratextual talk during preschool shared reading remained associated with children’s vocabulary skills through kindergarten, with trends toward significance extending to 1st grade literacy skills. The frequency of preschool shared reading was not a significant predictor of longitudinal outcomes."

Reading skills were examined descriptively and in relation to early language and literacy factors. Using stepwise regression analyses in which age and nonverbal IQ were controlled for, it was found that a single word reading measure taken at 7 years was unsurprisingly a strong predictor of the two different types of reading ability. However, even with this measure included, a receptive syntax task (TROG) entered when reading accuracy score was the DV. Furthermore, a test of expressive syntax/narrative and a receptive syntax task completed at 7 years entered into the model for word reading accuracy. When early reading accuracy was excluded from the analyses, early phonological skills also entered as a predictor of both reading accuracy and comprehension at 11 years. The group of children with a history of SLI were then divided into those with no literacy difficulties at 11 and those with some persisting literacy impairment. Using stepwise logistic regression, and again controlling for IQ and age, 7 years receptive syntax score (but not tests of phonology, expressive vocabulary or expressive syntax/narrative) entered as a positive predictor of membership of the ‘no literacy problems’ group regardless of whether early reading accuracy was controlled for in step one. The findings are discussed in relation to the overlap of SLI and dyslexia and the long term sequelae of language impairment."

The participants were 21 children with diagnosis of Specific developmental disorders of speech and language (F80; ICD-10) and 21 children as matched control group (in each group: mean age=79 months, 88% boys). Both samples were selected from the adaptation and standardization study of Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS Next) in Latvia (Good & Kaminski et al., 2011; Latvian version, Rascevska et al., 2013a). The results show significant differences between two groups in DIBELS Next composite score (t=3.09, p < .01), First Sound Fluency (t = 2.54, p < .05), Phoneme Segmentation Fluency (t = 2.80, p < .01), Correct Letter Sounds (t = 3.38, p < .01) and Whole Words Read (t = 3.39, p < .01) from Nonsense Word Fluency. Phoneme awareness represented by first sound and phoneme segmentation fluency and phonological decoding observed during nonsense word reading was poorer for the SLI group, albeit letter naming did not differ in both groups. No differences in letter naming might be explained due to intensive instruction the children with SLI are receiving in their institution of special education, while children from general population might not have this enhanced support."

In consistent orthographies, however, the acquisition of accurate phonological recoding and phonemic awareness was found to pose much less difficulty than in English, and even dyslexic children were found to exhibit high levels of performance in phonemic segmentation (Wimmer, 1993). Nevertheless, using a rather complex phonological awareness and manipulation task (spoonerisms: MAN–HAT → HAN– MAT), Landerl, Wimmer, and Frith (1997) found support for the original position on phonological awareness deficit, as both German and English dyslexic children showed poor performance. In the present studies, the spoonerism responses of Landerl et al. were reanalyzed such that children were given credit for partially correct responses (e.g., a response of HAN for MAN–HAT). Such partially correct responses were taken to indicate full segmentation of both stimulus words at the onset–rime level. The effect of this rescoring was that the error rate dropped from 76% to 26% for the English dyslexic children and from 63% to 15% for the German dyslexic children. Even higher performance levels, although not perfect as for the age-matched control children, were found on a nonword spelling task in both groups. A second study examined the segmentation of consonant clusters in younger German dyslexic children and found performance levels of about 90% correct when memory problems were ruled out. We argue that, at least in the context of a consistent orthography (and a phonics-based teaching approach), deficits in phoneme awareness are only evident in the early stages of reading acquisition, whereas rapid naming and phonological memory deficits are more persistent in dyslexic children."

Litt, Peter F. de Jong, Elsje van Bergen, Kate Nation","Abstract Recent research suggests that visual–verbal paired associate learning (PAL) may tap a crossmodal associative learning mechanism that plays a distinct role in reading development. However, evidence from children with dyslexia indicates that deficits in visual–verbal PAL are strongly linked to the verbal demands of the task. The primary aim of this study was to disassociate the role of modality and verbal demand in driving the PAL–reading relationship. To do so, we compared performance across four PAL mapping conditions: visual–verbal, verbal–verbal, visual–visual and verbal–visual. We reasoned that if crossmodal mapping demand accounts for the PAL–reading relationship, both visual–verbal PAL and verbal–visual PAL should exhibit significant relationships with reading ability. The results were incompatible with the crossmodal hypothesis. Only tasks requiring verbal output (visual–verbal PAL and verbal–verbal PAL) significantly correlated with reading ability. In addition, visual–verbal PAL and verbal–verbal PAL were well represented by a latent “verbal output PAL” factor. Structural equation modeling showed that this factor fully accounted for the PAL–reading relationship; visual–verbal PAL did not add anything to the prediction of reading above and beyond this latent factor. The results are interpreted according to an alternative verbal account of the PAL–reading relationship."

Each of the 66 subjects was rated by two teachers (English and mathematics) on the eight items of the Personal-Social Behavior section of the Myklebust Pupil Rating Scale. Factor analysis showed that the eight behaviors split into two factors: Factor I—responsibility and Factor II—social cooperation. The low math group was significantly lower than the other two groups on Factor I and the total scale but not on Factor II. Group differences occurred only among boys. It was concluded that children with a disability in mathematical computation may be at risk for impulsive and possibly antisocial behavior.

However, there is considerable variation in the literature concerning the magnitude of this relationship. The objective of the present study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the evidence on the relationship between rapid automatized naming (RAN) and reading performance. To this end, we conducted a meta-analysis of the correlational relationship between these 2 constructs to (a) determine the overall strength of the RAN–reading association and (b) identify variables that systematically moderate this relationship. A random-effects model analysis of data from 137 studies (857 effect sizes; 28,826 participants) indicated a moderate-to-strong relationship between RAN and reading performance (r = .43, I2 = 68.40). Further analyses revealed that RAN contributes to the 4 measures of reading (word reading, text reading, non-word reading, and reading comprehension), but higher coefficients emerged in favor of real word reading and text reading. RAN stimulus type and type of reading score were the factors with the greatest moderator effect on the magnitude of the RAN–reading relationship. The consistency of orthography and the subjects’ grade level were also found to impact this relationship, although the effect was contingent on reading outcome. It was less evident whether the subjects’ reading proficiency played a role in the relationship. Implications for future studies are discussed.

We propose that temperamental negative emotionality and working memory deficits operate to initiate the pathway that may culminate in comorbid language and behaviour problems.

Early deficits in RAP abilities may serve as a behavioral marker for language-based learning disabilities. The purpose of this study is to determine if performance on infant information processing measures designed to tap RAP and global processing skills differ as a function of family history of specific language impairment (SLI) and/or the particular demand characteristics of the paradigm used. Seventeen 6- to 9-month-old infants from families with a history of specific language impairment (FH+) and 29 control infants (FH ! ) participated in this study. Infants’ performance on two different RAP paradigms (head-turn procedure [HT] and auditory-visual habituation/recognition memory [AVH/RM]) and on a global processing task (visual habituation/recognition memory [VH/ RM]) was assessed at 6 and 9 months. Toddler language and cognitive skills were evaluated at 12 and 16 months. A number of significant group differences were seen: FH+ infants showed significantly poorer discrimination of fast rate stimuli on both RAP tasks, took longer to habituate on both habituation/recognition memory measures, and had lower novelty preference scores on the visual habituation/recognition memory task. Infants’ performance on the two RAP measures provided independent but converging contributions to outcome. Thus, different mechanisms appear to underlie performance on operantly conditioned tasks as compared to habituation/recognition memory paradigms. Further, infant RAP processing abilities predicted to 12- and 16month language scores above and beyond family history of SLI. The results of this study provide additional support for the validity of infant RAP abilities as a behavioral marker for later language outcome. Finally, this is the first study to use a battery of infant tasks to demonstrate multi-modal processing deficits in infants at risk for SLI."

After controlling for receptive vocabulary, regressions revealed that children knowing more letters were quicker to look at the featured letter on a page and spent more time looking at the featured letter, the word, and its first letter. Thus, alphabet books along with letter knowledge may facilitate entrance into the partial alphabetic stage of word recognition."

The primary focus is on the effects that differences in orthographic consistency might have on the process of learning to spell across alphabetic writing systems. General characteristics of alphabetic writing systems are summarized, and various indicators of orthographic consistency are discussed for one consistent (Czech) and two inconsistent (English, French) orthographies. Then, against a model of spelling development in English, the results of several studies of spelling development in relatively more consistent orthographies are considered. Together, the current findings suggest that the core component skills underlying spelling development, namely, phonological awareness and letter knowledge, are similar across alphabetic languages. However, the degree of consistency of an orthography seems to play an important mediating role in determining the rate of learning to spell. The extent to which..."

Wadsworth, Jacqueline Hulslander, Robin P. Corley, John C. DeFries, Peter Quain, Erik G. Willcutt, Richard K. Olson","Grade 1 literacy skills of twin children in Australia (New South Wales) and the United States (Colorado) were explored in a genetically sensitive design (N = 319 pairs). Analyses indicated strong genetic influence on word and nonword identification, reading comprehension, and spelling. Rapid naming showed more modest, though reliable, genetic influence. Phonological awareness was subject to high nonshared environment and no reliable genetic effects, and individual measures of memory and learning were also less affected by genes than nonshared environment. Multivariate analyses showed that the same genes affected word identification, reading comprehension, and spelling. Country comparisons indicated that the patterns of genetic influence on reading and spelling in Grade 1 were similar, though for the U.S. but not the Australian children new genes came on stream in the move from kindergarten to Grade 1. We suggest that this is because the more intensive kindergarten literacy curriculum in New South Wales compared with Colorado, consistent with the mean differences between the two countries, means that more of the genes are “online” sooner in Australia because of accelerated overall reading development."

Pennington, Richard Boada, Lawrence D. Shriberg","Background: Speech sound disorder (SSD) is a common childhood disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate errors in speech production that greatly reduce intelligibility. SSD has been found to be associated with later reading disability (RD), and there is also evidence for both a cognitive and etiological overlap between the two disorders. The present study tested whether SSD is linked to replicated risk loci for RD. Method: One hundred and eleven probands with SSD and their 76 siblings were tested with measures of speech, phonological memory (Nonword Repetition – NWR), and phonological awareness and genotyped for linkage markers on chromosomes 1p36, 6p22, and 15q21. Both single point and multipoint linkage were tested with multiple methods. Results: The speech and NWR phenotypes were linked to the RD loci on chromosomes 6 and 15, with suggestive results for the RD locus on chromosome 1. Conclusions: It now appears that several RD loci are pleiotropic for SSD, extending the findings of Stein et al. (2004) for the RD locus on Chromosome 3. Keywords: Behavioral genetics, comorbidity, genetic, reading disorder, speech disorder. The overall goal of the present study was to test whether speech sound disorder (SSD) is linked to risk loci for reading disability (RD), specifically those on chromosomes 1p36, 6p22, and 15q21 (see Fisher & DeFries, 2002 for a review). SSD is a common childhood disorder that affects as many as 16% of children at age 3 (Shriberg, 2002) and about 4% of children at age 6 (Shriberg, Tomblin, & McSweeny, 1999). It is defined by developmentally inappropriate errors in speech production that reduce intelligibility, and it is distinct from stuttering or mutism. In the past, SSD has been called articulation disorder and, more recently, phonological disorder. We prefer the SSD nomenclature because it recognizes that this disability has antecedents in both articulatory (sensorimotor) and phonological (cognitive-linguistic) domains. This term has been used recently in the classification of speech disorders from a genetic standpoint in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (2005; %608445). As issues of genetic etiology and phenotypic overlap are resolved, the terminology may be refined further. The rationale for hypothesizing a genetic overlap between a written language disorder, RD, and a spoken language disorder, SSD, derives from converging evidence of an association between the two disorders at three levels of analysis: symptom, cognitive, and etiological. We will next briefly review this evidence and then describe the current study."

Focusing on a sample of several hundred low-income children in 16 urban schools that were implementing literacy interventions, 1st-grade predictors of literacy development were traced over time. Beginning-of-1st-grade letter–word identification and word attack skills were the strongest predictors of reading comprehension at the end of 1st grade. However, vocabulary was the best predictor of reading comprehension at the end of 2nd and 3rd grades. The predictive power of early print-related and phonemic-awareness skills diminished over time, yet vocabulary scores remained an important predictor. Results support an early emphasis on developing meaning skills to prepare low-income children for success in literacy."

The parents of participants completed a questionnaire regarding their children’s home literacy experiences. The data showed systematic development in children’s understanding of print conventions and English orthography and spelling. Regression analyses indicated that print knowledge was related to early reading skill, even after accounting for variance due to age and phonological awareness. Furthermore, parents’ ratings of the extent of their children’s involvement in activities that led to practice in reading and writing most consistently predicted the development of emerging literacy skills, including understanding of the conventions of the English writing system. Little relation between print knowledge and the frequency of storybook reading by adults was observed."

Children were tested on pure copying of unfamiliar stimuli, rapid automatized naming (RAN), phoneme deletion, syllable deletion, and morphological awareness. With children’s ages and Raven’s nonverbal reasoning statistically controlled, the PE and PB groups were significantly lower than the C group on phoneme deletion and RAN tasks, while the DG performed significantly better than the PB group on the RAN task. The copying task distinguished the DG group from the C group. Findings particularly highlight the importance of phoneme awareness for word reading in English (but not Chinese), the potential need for fluency training for children with reading difficulties in both Chinese and English, and the important role that copying skills could have specifically in understanding impairment of literacy skills in Chinese (but not English)."

Their goal was to reduce the proportion of children who make minimal reading progress and to explore interventions for very hard-to-teach children, particularly that group variously labeled nonresponders or treatment resisters. Studies supported by the National Institutes of Health suggested more intense intervention; however, this was precluded by limited funds. Schools used available resources to intensify instruction for children struggling to acquire basic literacy. Although reading failure rates declined among students who received additional instruction, the interventions did not significantly decrease the proportion of children identified for special education."

Instead, one must develop empirical benchmarks of comparison that reflect the nature of the intervention being evaluated, its target population, and the outcome measure or measures being used. This approach is applied to the assessment of effect size measures for educational interventions designed to improve student academic achievement. Three types of empirical benchmarks are illustrated: (a) normative expectations for growth over time in student achievement, (b) policy-relevant gaps in student achievement by demographic group or school performance, and (c) effect size results from past research for similar interventions and target populations. The findings can be used to help assess educational interventions, and the process of doing so can provide guidelines for how to develop and use such benchmarks in other fields."

Reading achievement was subsequently assessed at the end of Kindergarten and Grade 1. The strongest predictors of reading achievement were tasks tapping phonological processing skills, interdigital dexterity, and familiarity with the alphabetic code of English script. Collectively, individual attributes accounted for 63% of the variance in reading achievement at the end of Kindergarten and 59% at the end of Grade 1. A short set of five predictors offers a potentially useful screening test for the early identification of reading-disabled children. The effect of the ability composition of a child's class and school was also assessed. Significant ability-composition effects were obtained, accounting for 9% of Kindergarten and 6% of Grade 1 reading achievement variance over and above variance owing to individual factors. Peer ability was as strong a predictor of individual reading achievement as individual ability. Children emerging from primary school exhibit enormous variation in their reading achievement. Within a single school it is possible to find children who are reading at several grades above their own grade level, while other children at the same school are reading at several grades below. Furthermore, there are often substantial differences in reading achievement between schools. The source of this enormous variation in achievement has been the focus of considerable research in the last two decades.

A self-organizing systems (SOS) paradigm suggests widespread, diffuse outcomes, whereas a specific learning disability concept suggests more localized dysfunction. There may be very good reason to doubt the veridicality of the concept of a specific learning disability, not because the construct of learning disabilities itself is a frivolous concept, as some have held, but because the biological or neurological events that underlie a learning disability do not remain focal and constrained only to specific dysfunction. It is important to know whether an identified learning disability remains contained or whether processing disorders might be found in other areas.

Quite different from findings with English-speaking children, phonological awareness deficits did not affect phonological coding in word recognition but did affect orthographic spelling and foreign-word reading. Naming-speed deficits did affect reading fluency, orthographic spelling, and foreign-word reading. Apparently, in the context of a regular orthography and a synthetic phonics teaching approach, early phases of literacy acquisition (particularly the acquisition of phonological coding) are less affected by early phonological awareness deficits than are later phases that depend on the build up of orthographic memory. The double-deficit hypothesis was developed by Maryanne Wolf and Patricia Bowers as an extension of the dominant phonological-deficit explanation of developmental dyslexia (e.g., Bowers & Wolf, 1993; Wolf & Bowers, 1999). The phonologicaldeficit hypothesis postulates an early difficulty in acquiring phonological awareness, which interferes with the acquisition of grapheme-phoneme coding as a word recognition mechanism, which in turn results in reduced self-teaching of orthographic word representations (Share, 1995). The early problem with phonological awareness is seen as resulting from less sharp phoneme boundaries in speech perception (Fowler, 1991) or from less distinct phonological word representations (Elbro & Peterson, 1998). The double-deficit hypothesis acknowledges the phonological awareness deficit of dyslexic children but stresses a deficit in naming speed as a second and equally important cause of reading difficulties. The first demonstration that dyslexic children show impaired naming speed was provided by Denckla and Rudel (1976), whose Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) Test became the standard assessment of naming speed. In the RAN test, a large array of repeatedly presented, well-known visual patterns (pictured objects, color patches, digits) has to be named as quickly as possible. Wolf, Bally, and Morris (1986) were the In:st to show that early differences in rapid naming are predictive of later reading difficulties. The double-deficit hypothesis is based on findings (reviewed by Wolf & Bowers, 1999) showing that, typically, there are only modest correlations between phonological awareness measures and RAN performance in groups of dyslexic children and that dyslexic children as a group exhibit both phonological awareness deficits and naming-speed deficits. From these findings,"

An endophenotype may be neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological (including configured self-report data) in nature. Endophenotypes represent simpler clues to genetic underpinnings than the disease syndrome itself, promoting the view that psychiatric diagnoses can be decomposed or deconstructed, which can result in more straightforward—and successful—genetic analysis. However, to be most useful, endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders must meet certain criteria, including association with a candidate gene or gene region, heritability that is inferred from relative risk for the disorder in relatives, and disease association parameters.

Verhagen, C.A.J. Aarnoutse, Jan van Leeuwe","The influences of early phonological awareness and naming speed on Dutch children’s later word spelling were investigated in a longitudinal study. Phonological awareness and naming speed predicted spelling in early Grade 1, later Grade 1, and later Grade 2. Phonological awareness, however, predominated over naming speed for the prediction of early Grade 1 spelling. Comparison of the present results with those from an earlier study of children’s word recognition using the same dataset and also structural equation modeling showed word recognition speed at the ends of Grades 1 and 2 in the earlier study to be uniquely predicted by early naming speed. Nonetheless, naming speed may measure almost the same in word recognition and word spelling accuracy. Many longitudinal studies have investigated the effects of phonological awareness and naming speed on word recognition. Similar longitudinal studies on word spelling are rare for both English orthography and languages with relatively more consistent orthographies. Such studies are nevertheless of importance to discover what naming speed measures with respect to spelling and to compare this information to what is known about children’s word recognition. In the present study, the relations of phonological awareness and naming speed to spelling accuracy in Grades 1 and 2 are investigated longitudinally. It is hypothesized that phonological awareness will predominate over naming speed in the prediction of word spelling accuracy at the beginning of Grade 1, but that both skills will equally influence word spelling accuracy by the end of Grade 1 and, for that matter, the end of Grade 2."

Significant differences were observed between mean scores obtained by the group of children with NF1 compared to the validated controls from the speech and language instruments (P ≤ 0.009). Sixty-eight percent of the children exhibited delays in speech and/or language. Thirty-two percent demonstrated delays in articulation, 37% percent demonstrated delays in receptive language, and 37% exhibited delays in expressive language. Sixteen percent of the children exhibited a voice disorder and 42% were judged to have a resonance problem. No significant differences were observed on any of the measures of speech and language for children with non-familial versus familial NF1. Results of this study support the need for early assessment of speech and language problems for children diagnosed with NF1 and implementation of appropriate timely intervention as needed. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Abstract
THE RAPID AUTOMATIZED NAMING TEST: ITS HISTORY AND RELEVANCY IN THE READING PROCESS The importance of the reading process and which are the components that involve has generated numerous developments and research worldwide. The aim of this theoretical research is to examine the origins and history of Rapid Automatized Naming Test, along with its consequent developments. The speed of access to the lexical label makes an unique contribution to reading beyond the other components that are involved. And it is of importance to note that this tool has proven to be useful not only as a potential predictor of reading difficulties, but also as discriminating between good and poor readers. The research results refer mostly opaque languages, but there are also few studies about transparent language and how it works there the speed of access to the lexical label in reading. Consequently, this test would be essential at the moment if intervening at an early stage of what could be potential reading difficulties in children, for which it would be necessary to do an adaptation of the same one along with the development of local standards.

Stimulus tones were presented at various rates. There were no significant differences between groups on tests in which stimuli were presented at slow rates. However, when the same stimuli were presented more rapidly, the reading-impaired group made significantly more errors than the controls. The reading-impaired children's ability to use phonics skills (nonsense word reading) was also examined. There was a high correlation between the number of errors made on the phonics reading test and the number of errors made in responding to the rapidly presented stimuli in the auditory perceptual tests. The hypothesis that some reading impairments are related to low-level auditory perceptual dysfunction that affects the ability to learn to use phonics skills adequately is discussed."

Speece, Christina Mills, Kristen D. Ritchey, Elgen Hillman","This longitudinal investigation evaluated the validity of letter-name fluency (LNF) and nonsense word fluency (NWF) measures as indicators of early reading skill with a sample of 39 kindergarten children. In the spring of kindergarten and first grade, these children responded to a battery of language, reading-related, and reading measures. Construct and social consequential validity were evaluated through concurrent and predictive criterion-related validity coefficients, multiple regression analyses, and classification analysis. Evidence supportive of validity was found for both fluency measures, with NWF receiving the strongest support. Both fluency measures were more sensitive to poor reader status in first grade than any other measure when reading was defined by oral reading fluency. These findings extend the usefulness of NWF to the early identification of kindergarten students."

A polemic research issue in this area has been the nature of the perception deficit. Another issue is the causal role of this deficit in dyslexia. Most studies have been carried out in adult and child literates; consequently, the observed deficits may be the result rather than the cause of dyslexia. This study addresses these issues by examining visual and auditory perception in children at risk for dyslexia. We compared children from preschool with and without risk for dyslexia in auditory and visual temporal order judgment tasks and same–different discrimination tasks. Identical visual and auditory, linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli were presented in both tasks. The results revealed that the visual as well as the auditory perception of children at risk for dyslexia is impaired. The comparison between groups in auditory and visual perception shows that the achievement of children at risk was lower than children without risk for dyslexia in the temporal tasks. There were no differences between groups in auditory discrimination tasks. The difficulties of children at risk in visual and auditory perceptive processing affected both linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli. Our conclusions are that children at risk for dyslexia show auditory and visual perceptive deficits for linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli. The auditory impairment may be explained by temporal processing problems and these problems are more serious for processing language than for processing other auditory stimuli. These visual and auditory perceptive deficits are not the consequence of failing to learn to read, thus, these findings support the theory of temporal processing deficit."

Fuchs, Douglas Fuchs, Donald L. Compton",This study contrasts the validity of 2 early reading curriculum-based measurement (CBM) measures: word identification fluency and nonsense word fluency. At-risk children (n = 151) were assessed (a) on criterion reading measures in the fall and spring of first grade and (b) on the 2 CBM measures each week for 7 weeks and twice weekly for an additional 13 weeks. Concurrent and predictive validity for CBM performance level and predictive validity for CBM slopes demonstrated the superiority of word identification fluency over nonsense word fluency. Findings are discussed in terms of the measures' utility for identifying children in need of intensive instruction and for monitoring children's progress through first grade.

Multiple regression analyses indicated that the best predictor of achievement across the five academic tests was the Verbal Comprehension factor from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised. Age, socioeconomic status (SES), and externalizing behavior problems were also significant predictors of achievement, depending on the academic measure. After controlling for age, SES, behavior problems, and intelligence, the phonological awareness task added significantly to the prediction of word attack, spelling, and reading comprehension scores; rapid letter naming added significantly to the prediction of word identification and prose passage speed and accuracy scores; and a word-..."

Catts,"Speech production/articulation was examined in reading-disordered and normal children. Subjects participated in three tasks involving the production of multisyllabic words and phonologically complex phrases. Results demonstrated that the reading-disordered children made significantly more speech production errors than normal children in each of the tasks. Furthermore, the reading-disordered children's performance on the speech production tasks was correlated with their reading ability. It is concluded that the speech production difficulties of the reading-disordered children are a reflection of their various deficits in phonological processing."

Analysis of variance and receiver operating characteristics were used to investigate the effects of rapid automatized naming (RAN) and phonemic awareness (PA) in predicting group membership. The highest predictive values were found for the combination of RAN and PA, particularly for the poorest readers. Furthermore, results indicate that with the severity of impairment, WR is more dominated by deficient PA, which is interpreted as an enduring problem with sublexical processing. Another main result is that with the increase of reading skill, the contribution of PA diminishes, whereas the contribution of RAN remains fairly constant for the whole reading fluency continuum. These results warrant the conclusion that whereas PA hallmarks reading disability, RAN appears to be the default predictor for above-average or excellent reading pr..."

Bishop, Susan E. Stothard","The literacy skills of 56 school leavers from the Bishop and Edmundson (1987) cohort of preschoolers with specific language impairment (SLI) were assessed at 15 years. The SLI group performed worse on tests of reading, spelling, and reading comprehension than age-matched controls and the literacy outcomes were particularly poor for those with Performance IQ less than 100. The rate of specific reading retardation in the SLI group had increased between the ages of 8½ and 15 years and there had been a substantial drop in reading accuracy, relative to age. However, over 35% had reading skills within the normal range and those who had had isolated impairments of expressive phonology had a particularly good outcome. Our findings highlight the limitations of discrepancy definitions of dyslexia that do not take account of the changing demands of reading over time. We argue that children's phonological difficulties place them at risk of literacy failure at the outset of reading and that later, impairments of other language skills compromise development to adult levels of fluency."

Monaco,"Specific language impairment (SLI) is defined as an inability to develop appropriate language skills without explanatory medical conditions, low intelligence or lack of opportunity. Previously, a genome scan of 98 families affected by SLI was completed by the SLI Consortium, resulting in the identification of two quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 16q (SLI1) and 19q (SLI2). This was followed by a replication of both regions in an additional 86 families. Both these studies applied linkage methods to one phenotypic trait at a time. However, investigations have suggested that simultaneous analysis of several traits may offer more power. The current study therefore applied a multivariate variance-components approach to the SLI Consortium dataset using additional phenotypic data. A multivariate genome scan was completed and supported the importance of the SLI1 and SLI2 loci, whilst highlighting a possible novel QTL on chromosome 10. Further investigation implied that the effect of SLI1 on non-word repetition was equally as strong on reading and spelling phenotypes. In contrast, SLI2 appeared to have influences on a selection of expressive and receptive language phenotypes in addition to non-word repetition, but did not show linkage to literacy phenotypes."

This stage is not evident in a matched group of children with Williams syndrome. The close relationship between SLI and dyslexia is examined, followed by a brief summary of the evidence in support of an inherited contribution to SLI. A succinct discussion of brain/behavior studies of SLI is provided. The close relationship between the condition of SLI and socioemotional development is explicated, with implications for diagnosis, interpretation, and treatment. A section on future directions notes the strong parallels in the science of dyslexia and the science of SLI and calls for further work on diagnostic markers, carried out in prospective longitudinal studies, as a way of furthering our understanding of the etiology of SLI, dyslexia, and other conditions, such as Williams syndrome, where language impairment is implicated or spared.

Development of syllable complexity was examined at five periods across this 11-month window. Results indicated that children who later evidenced RD produced a lower proportion of canonical utterances and less complex syllable structures than children without RD. As syllable complexity is an early indicator of phonological sophistication, differences at this level may offer a window into how the phonological system of children with RD is structured. Future directions for this line of research are discussed."

This study used data from a large sample of 4[fraction one-half]-year-old twins who were tested on measures assessing articulation, phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and verbal memory. Phenotypic analysis suggested two latent factors: articulation (2 measures) and general language (the remaining 7), and a genetic model incorporating these factors provided a good fit to the data. Almost all genetic and shared environmental influences on the 9 measures acted through the two latent factors. There was also substantial aetiological overlap between the two latent factors, with a genetic correlation of 0·64 and shared environment correlation of 1·00. We conclude that to a large extent, the same genetic and environmental factors underlie the development of individual differences in a wide range of linguistic skills."

Both phonological processing and literacy skills were tested at each of four time points. Consistent with the well-known familiarity of RD, 34% of the HR group compared with 6% of the LR group became RD. Participants who became RD showed deficits in both implicit and explicit phonological processing skills at all four time points, clearly indicating a broader phonological deficit than is often found at older ages. The predictors of literacy skill did not vary by risk group. Both risk groups underwent a similar developmental shift from letter-name knowledge to phoneme awareness as the main predictor of later literacy skill. This shift, however, occurred 2 years later in the HR group. Familial risk was continuous rather than discrete because HR children who did not become RD performed worse than LR non-RD children on some phonological and literacy measures. Finally, later RD could be predicted with moderate accuracy at age 5 years, with the strongest predictor being letter-name knowledge."

Educational development in any student has a direct relation with the ability of the comprehension. This study is designed to investigate the effects of hearing loss on reading comprehension in hearing-impaired students compared to normal-hearing ones. Methods: Seventeen hearing-impaired students in 4 th year of primary exceptional schools in Karaj, Robatkarim and Shahriyar, Iran, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Seventeen normal-hearing students were randomly selected from ordinary schools next to exceptional ones as control group. They were compared for different levels of reading comprehension using the international standard booklet (PIRLS 2001). Results: There was a significant difference in performance between hearing-impaired and normalhearing students in different levels of reading comprehension (p<0.05). Conclusion: Hearing loss has negative effects on different levels of reading comprehension, so in exceptional centers, reconsideration in educational planning in order to direct education from memorizing to comprehension and deeper layers of learning seems necessary."

Practice on motor skills results in facilitation in treatment progress of children with phonological disorders. The purpose of this study was to compare motor skills in 5-year-old children with phonological and phonetic disorders. Methods: Thirty-two children age 5 years, 16 with phonemical speech sound disorders and 16 with difficulty at a phonetic level participated in this study. TOLD Test was performed for linguistic skills investigation among children. Phonetic test, Wepman test, diadochokinesis and oral assessment was used for diagnosis between phonological and phonetic disorders. The children were also evaluated with Oseretsky motor developmental scale . Results: In comparison, mean scores of movement skills between both groups showed significant difference (p=0.006) and children with phonetic disorder got significantly higher scores on all part of this test. Conclusions: The findings of this study support the idea that speech sound disorders are frequently associated with motor problems, and that type of articulation disorder affects the motor performance in a different way. Phonological disorders seem to have more impact on motor performance than phonetic disorders. The results authenticate the need to pay more attention to the motor skills of children with articulation disorders."

To use orthographic information for auditory word learning, children must recode printed words phonologically to assist the reconstruction of the speech single misheard or underspecified, an ability that may depend heavily on phonological awareness (PA). In this study, children with poorer PA of Chinese and those with better PA were taught novel English words in an auditory learning task under two exposure conditions: auditory words presented with their written forms and auditory words presented with undecodable symbols. Word learning performance was better in the written form condition than in the symbol condition, but the effect was smaller for children with poorer PA. The facilitative effect was associated with L2 PA for children with poorer PA but not for children with better PA. The results are discussed with regard to how poor PA may constrain auditory word learning in an L2 context."

Iyengar","Speech-sound disorder (SSD) is a complex behavioral disorder characterized by speech-sound production errors associated with deficits in articulation, phonological processes, and cognitive linguistic processes. SSD is prevalent in childhood and is comorbid with disorders of language, spelling, and reading disability, or dyslexia. Previous research suggests that developmental problems in domains associated with speech and language acquisition place a child at risk for dyslexia. Recent genetic studies have identified several candidate regions for dyslexia, including one on chromosome 3 segregating in a large Finnish pedigree. To explore common genetic influences on SSD and reading, we examined linkage for several quantitative traits to markers in the pericentrometric region of chromosome 3 in 77 families ascertained through a child with SSD. The quantitative scores measured several processes underlying speech-sound production, including phonological memory, phonological representation, articulation, receptive and expressive vocabulary, and reading decoding and comprehension skills. Model-free linkage analysis was followed by identification of sib pairs with linkage and construction of core shared haplotypes. In our multipoint analyses, measures of phonological memory demonstrated the strongest linkage (marker D3S2465, P =5.6×10 −5 , and marker D3S3716, P =6.8×10 −4 ). Tests for single-word decoding also demonstrated linkage (real word reading: marker D3S2465, P =.004; nonsense word reading: marker D3S1595, P =.005). The minimum shared haplotype in sib pairs with similar trait values spans 4.9 cM and is bounded by markers D3S3049 and D3S3045. Our results suggest that domains common to SSD and dyslexia are pleiotropically influenced by a putative quantitative trait locus on chromosome 3."

Nazir","In this paper we review the literature on visual constraints in written word processing. We notice that not all letters are equally visible to the reader. The letter that is most visible is the letter that is fixated. The visibility of the other letters depends on the distance between the letters and the fixation location, whether the letters are outer or inner letters of the word, and whether the letters lie to the left or to the right of the fixation location. Because of these three factors, word recognition depends on the viewing position. In languages read from left to right, the optimal viewing position is situated between the beginning and the middle of the word. This optimal viewing position is the result of an interplay of four variables: the distance between the viewing position and the farthest letter, the fact that the word beginning is usually more informative than the word end, the fact that during reading words have been recognised a lot of times after fixation on this letter position and the fact that stimuli in the right visual field have direct access to the left cerebral hemisphere. For languages read from right to left, the first three variables pull the optimal viewing position towards the right side of the word (which is the word beginning), but the fourth variable counteracts these forces to some extent. Therefore, the asymmetry of the optimum viewing-position curve is less clear in Hebrew and Arabic than in French and Dutch."

The purpose was to investigate (1) whether results from the 2(1/2)-y screening were persistent at 6 y of age, and (2) what language domains at age 6 were difficult for (a) children with LD at age 2(1/2) y and (b) children with normal language (LN) at the same age. Significant differences between LD and LN at age 2(1/2) y were persistent at age 6. The vulnerability that was identified at 2(1/2) y of age, such as problems with going from single-word utterances to multi-word utterances, seems to persist as delayed development at different language levels and across language domains. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that children who failed the 2(1/2)-y screening are at high risk of having persistent language problems at age 6 y."

We hypothesized that neural pathways downstream of FOXP2 influence more common phenotypes, such as specific language impairment. Methods We performed genomic screening for regions bound by FOXP2 using chromatin immunoprecipitation, which led us to focus on one particular gene that was a strong candidate for involvement in language impairments. We then tested for associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene and language deficits in a well-characterized set of 184 families affected with specific language impairment. Results We found that FOXP2 binds to and dramatically down-regulates CNTNAP2, a gene that encodes a neurexin and is expressed in the developing human cortex.

Williams,"This article describes a project that integrated basic educational research, the development of an instructional program, and its evaluation in a classroom setting. The program, called The ABDs of Reading, provided explicit training in phoneme analysis and phoneme blending, letter-sound correspondences, and decoding. Recent research indicating the importance of phoneme skills in beginning reading provided a rationale for the program. The results of 2 years of program evaluation in New York City classrooms for learning-disabled children indicated that the program successfully teaches general decoding strategies. That is, instructed children were able to decode novel combinations of letters that were not presented in training. No extensive teachertraining, teacher-aides, or other unusual classroom support was required. The purpose of this article is to describe an instructional program that teaches basic decoding skills to learning-disabled children, to present the rationale for its development, and to present results of field trials designed to evaluate its effectiveness. The project was undertaken primarily to develop and evaluate curriculum materials. The work that was done addresses questions of current research interest and describes a process whereby basic educational research can be translated into usable school materials. The program was developed to serve as a supplement to whatever reading program is being used in the classroom. In the work to be reported here, it was used in remedial instruction.

In this article the authors review studies of word learning by normal adults and children, neuropsychological patients, and special developmental populations, which provide evidence that the phonological loop plays a crucial role in learning the novel phonological forms of new words.

1421,2153428858,development and disorders of neurocognitive systems for oral language and reading,2001,10.2307/1511244,Learning Disability Quarterly,"James R. Booth, Douglas D. Burman","Abstract. There are four goals of this article. First, a tentative neurocognitive model of oral language and reading is outlined. Second, our recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (fMRI) on the development of oral language and reading are briefly reviewed with reference to this neurocognitive model. Third, brain-imaging research on dyslexia is discussed in light of the neurocognitive model. Fourth, research on the plasticity of neural systems and the implication of this plasticity for studying normative development and disorders is presented. Reading disorder is the most common form of learning problem in the United States (estimates range from 5-15%) and, therefore, represents a biomedical issue of major importance (Shaywitz, Shaywitz, Fletcher, & Escobar, 1990). Before discussing the neural basis of reading disorders, we need to review the neural representation and development of oral language and reading. Neurocognitive Model of Oral Language and Reading Oral language and reading differ at the most basic level in terms of the nature of perceptual input (see Figure 1). In oral language, auditory input is transmitted from the medial geniculate nucleus in the thalamus to both primary auditory areas (PA) and auditory association areas (AA), the latter of which may contain phonologic representations of words (Binder et al., 1994). In written language, visual input is transmitted from the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus to primary visual areas (PV) in the striate cortex and to secondary visual areas in the extrastriate cortex (EX). From the primary visual area, information has a ventral ""what"" projection and a dorsal ""where"" projection (Mishkin, Ungerleider, & Macko, 1983). The ventral projection includes the unimodal visual area of the fusiform gyrus (FG), which may contain orthographic representations of words (Fujimaki et al., 1999; Herbster, Mintun, Nebes, & Becker, 1997; Nobre, Allison, & McCarthy, 1994). The dorsal projection includes the superior parietal lobule, which may be important in aspects of reading that involve spatial attention. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Wernicke's area (W) and surrounding areas, including angular gyrus (AG) and supramarginal gyrus (SG), are heteromodal areas that may be responsible for the integration of spoken and written word forms with arbitrary associations that give rise to meaning or semantics (Mesulam, 1998; Pugh et al., 1996). Consistent with this role, Wernicke's area is interconnected to category-specific areas in the inferior temporal lobe that appear to contain representations of faces, animals and tools (Damasio, Grabowski, Tranel, Hichwa, & Damasio, 1996; Di Virgilio & Clarke, 1997). Wernicke's area also has massive connections through the arcuate fasciculus with Broca's area (B), which tends to show later peaks of activation in language tasks (Thierry, Boulanouar, Kherif, Ranjeva, & Demonet, 1999). Broca's area includes brain regions for overt (Hagoort et al., 1999) and covert speech production of articulatory word forms involving segmented phonology (Friedman et al., 1998; Paulesu et al., 1996) as well as syntactic processing (Booth et al., 200lb; Caplan, Alpert, & Waters, 1998). The anterior temporal region (AT) is strongly interconnected with Broca's area through the uncinate fiber tract and is also implicated in syntactic processing (Mazoyer et al., 1993; Vorob'ev et al., 1998). Finally, the prefrontal cortex (PF) may be responsible for modulation of processing in posterior regions such as Wernicke's area (Frith, Friston, Liddle, & Frackowiak, 1991; Raichle et al., 1994) and/or for maintaining and manipulating verbal information in memory (Gabrieli, Desmond, Demb, Wagner et al., 1996; Jonides et al., 1997). For further details on the functional anatomy of language processing, we refer the reader to chapters in a recent edited book, which presents a critical evaluation of research that is largely consistent with the model outlined above (Hagoort, Brown, & Osterhout, 1999; Price, Indefrey, & van Turennout, 1999). …"

Additionally, compensatory mechanisms in children and adults with DD have been located within frontal brain areas. However, it remains unclear when and how differences in posterior left-hemispheric networks manifest and whether compensatory mechanisms have already started to develop in the prereading brain. Here we investigate functional networks during phonological processing in 36 prereading children with a familial risk for DD (n = 18, average age = 66.50 mo) compared with age and IQ-matched controls (n = 18; average age = 65.61 mo). Functional neuroimaging results reveal reduced activation in prereading children with a family-history of DD (FHD+), compared with those without (FHD−), in bilateral occipitotemporal and left temporoparietal brain regions. This finding corresponds to previously identified hypoactivations in left hemispheric posterior brain regions for school-aged children and adults with a diagnosis of DD. Furthermore, left occipitotemporal and temporoparietal brain activity correlates positively with prereading skills in both groups. Our results suggest that differences in neural correlates of phonological processing in individuals with DD are not a result of reading failure, but are present before literacy acquisition starts. Additionally, no hyperactivation in frontal brain regions was observed, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms for reading failure are not yet present. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether the identified differences may serve as neural premarkers for the early identification of children at risk for DD."

Genetic influences on five prereading skills (print knowledge, rapid naming, phonological awareness, vocabulary, and verbal memory) were primarily responsible for relations with word reading and spelling. However, relations with post-fourth-grade reading comprehension were due to both genetic and shared environmental influences. Genetic and shared environmental influences that were common among the prereading variables covaried with reading and spelling, as did genetic influences unique to verbal memory (only post-fourth-grade comprehension), print knowledge, and rapid naming."

The objective of this article is to locate these two themes within a broader framework of understanding by: 1) discussing examples of how the reinforcement of disciplinary power in schools was introduced, justified and deployed by right-wing constellations during this time; and 2) to relate these policy changes to both a Foucauldian theory of power and to current discussions on performativity, assessment and governmentality. Considered as attempts to locate students, teachers and schools within networks of performativity, thereby strengthening the image of Sweden as a “performing knowledge nation”, we argue that these policy changes have a much closer relationship with the art of “perception management” than with any genuine interest in education for human proficiency.

Method: The preschool language skills of 112 children at family risk of dyslexia (FR) at ages 3½ and 4½ were compared with those of children with SLI and typically developing (TD) controls. Results: Children at FR showed two different profiles: one third of the group resembled the children with SLI and scored poorly across multiple domains of language including phonology. As a group, the remaining children had difficulties on tasks tapping phonological skills at T1 and T2. At the individual level, we confirmed that some FR children had both phonological and broader oral language difficulties (compared with TD controls), some had only phonological difficulties and some appeared to be developing typically. Conclusions: We have highlighted the early overlap between family risk of dyslexia and SLI. A family history of dyslexia carries an increased risk for SLI and the two disorders both show an increased incidence of phonological deficits which appear to a proximal risk factor for developing a reading impairment.

A total of 229 families of preschoolers were recruited. Parents completed a survey describing their parenting practices, while children’s literacy skills were directly assessed by using standardized measures. Parents also reported on children’s social development. Factor analyses supported a three-dimensional structure of parenting including the home learning environment, autonomy support/expectations, and management/discipline. Path models showed that the home learning environment predicted literacy skills; specifically, parents’ teaching about letters and sounds was associated with alphabet knowledge, while shared book reading was marginally linked to vocabulary. Management/discipline was uniquely related to selfregulation, while cooperative/compliant skills were associated with the home learning environment, support/expectations, and management/discipline. Findings suggested that parenting could be conceptualized as three relatively independent dimensions, each of which demonstrated domain-specific contributions to early literacy and social skills."

This study used a baseline measure of language that was independent of the measure used for diagnosis in order to control for factors leading to regression to the mean. Patterns of change using the kindergarten diagnostic measure were compared to those using the baseline measure. Rates of diagnostic change between kindergarten and subsequent observation intervals showed patterns of change similar to those of past research.

An unbiased appraisal of these outcomes, however, requires carefully designed, longitudinal research. Method: A group of children first identified as having speech and/or language impairment in a community-based, longitudinal study at 5 years of age and matched controls were re-examined during young adulthood (age 19). A comprehensive battery of speech and language, cognitive and achievement tests, psychiatric interviews, and questionnaires were completed by subjects, their parents and teachers. Results: While children with early speech problems showed only a few academic differences from controls in young adulthood, early language impaired (LI) young adults lagged significantly behind controls in all areas of academic achievement, even after controlling for intelligence. Further, rates of learning disabilities (LD) were significantly higher in the LI group than both the controls and community base rates. Concurrent individual difference variables, including phonological awareness, naming speed for digits, non-verbal IQ, verbal working memory, and executive function, all contributed unique variance to achievement in specific areas. Conclusion: Early LI rather than speech impairment is clearly associated with continued academic difficulties into adulthood. These results speak to the need for intensive, early intervention for LI youngsters.

Children receiving direct code instruction improved in word reading at a faster rate and had higher word-recognition skills than those receiving implicit code instruction. Effects of instructional group on word recognition were model ated by initial levels of phonological processing and were most apparent in children with poorer initial phonological processing skills. Group differences in reading comprehension paralleled those for word recognition but were less robust. Groups did not differ in spelling achievement or in vocabulary growth. Results show advantages for reading instructional programs that emphasize explicit instruction in the alphabetic principle for at-risk children.

McGregor, Sandra R. Waxman","According to the storage hypothesis (Kail & Leonard, 1986), wordfinding deficits in young children are not the direct result of deficient retrieval strategies; they are a manifestation of a general delay in language development that aects lexical storage. In the current study, we explored one aspect of lexical storage, the hierarchical organization of the semantic system, in 13 preschoolers with word-finding deficits (WF) and 13 preschoolers with normal language abilities (ND), ranging in age from 3;3 to 6;7. The children named a series of objects at multiple levels of the noun hierarchy in response to contrast questions (e.g. for rose they were asked, ‘Is this an animal?’ to elicit plant [superordinate]; ‘Is this a tree?’ to elicit flower [basic]; ‘Is this a dandelion?’ to elicit rose [subordinate]). Both groups readily named at multiple levels, providing evidence of hierarchical organization of the lexicon. However, there were several dierences between WF and ND groups that suggested that WF children did not have enough stored information to discriminate between similar semantic neighbours. We conclude (1) that hierarchical organization of the semantic lexicon is a robust developmental phenomenon, apparent in both ND and WF preschoolers and (2) that the word-finding deficits of preschoolers appear to reflect insucient depth and breadth of storage elaboration rather than deficits in hierarchical semantic organization."

Holly Fitch, Heather Breslawski, Glenn D. Rosen, James J. Chrobak","Background: Anomalies of cortical neuronal migration (e.g., microgyria (MG) and/or ectopias) are associated with a variety of language and cognitive deficits in human populations. In rodents, postnatal focal freezing lesions lead to the formation of cortical microgyria similar to those seen in human dyslexic brains, and also cause subsequent deficits in rapid auditory processing similar to those reported in human language impaired populations. Thus convergent findings support the ongoing study of disruptions in neuronal migration in rats as a putative model to provide insight on human language disability. Since deficits in working memory using both verbal and non-verbal tasks also characterize dyslexic populations, the present study examined the effects of neonatally induced bilateral cortical microgyria (MG) on working memory in adult male rats. Methods: A delayed match-to-sample radial water maze task, in which the goal arm was altered among eight locations on a daily basis, was used to assess working memory performance in MG (n = 8) and sham (n = 10) littermates. Results: Over a period of 60 sessions of testing (each session comprising one pre-delay sample trial, and one post-delay test trial), all rats showed learning as evidenced by a significant decrease in overall test errors. However, MG rats made significantly more errors than shams during initial testing, and this memory deficit was still evident after 60 days (12 weeks) of testing. Analyses performed on daily error patterns showed that over the course of testing, MG rats utilized a strategy similar to shams (but with less effectiveness, as indicated by more errors). Conclusion: These results indicate persistent abnormalities in the spatial working memory system in rats with induced disruptions of neocortical neuronal migration."

However, it is unclear whether this result is causal in nature or whether it can be explained by difficult-to-measure heterogeneity at the community, family, or individual level. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and ordinary least squares, we show that stuttering is negatively associated with high school grades, the probability of high school graduation, and the probability of college attendance. However, empirical specifications with family fixed effects or controls for learning disabilities such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder suggest that these associations can, in large part, be explained by difficult-to-measure heterogeneity."

Wong, Hua Shu","Predictors of age 10 spelling and reading comprehension skills in both Chinese and English from vocabulary knowledge, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming (RAN), and word reading at age 8 were tested in this longitudinal study of 141 Hong Kong Chinese children learning to read English as a second language. The correlation between spelling in Chinese and English was .64, whereas the correlation between reading comprehension in the two languages was .66. For both Chinese and English spelling, only RAN and word reading in the target language were unique predictors; this association of RAN to spelling was reduced once concurrent spelling in the other language was statistically controlled. In contrast, longitudinal predictors of English reading comprehension were vocabulary knowledge in both Chinese and English, as well as phonological awareness and English word reading. Father's income was a reliable longitudinal predictor of English but not Chinese reading comprehension; girls also tended to be better readers than boys overall. With all other literacy variables included in separate regression equations, spelling or reading comprehension in the other language was uniquely associated with spelling or reading comprehension in the target language, supporting the notion of transfer for each skill. Findings highlight the possibility of transfer in both spelling and reading comprehension from Chinese to English and show that unique longitudinal predictors of L2 English spelling and reading comprehension differ in predictable ways."

Brian Thompson,"This is a review of theory and evidence on how abstract letter units (ALUs) are initially learnt by the developing individual. Despite the predominance of the lower-case form of letters in the print environment, naming identification of upper case has precedence over lower case among preschool children. Such children showed a significant lag in extending their categories of upper-case variants to include the corresponding lower-case forms that are visually dissimilar. As late as 11 years of age children gave longer naming latencies for the lower-case than the upper-case forms. Initial learning of ALUs proceeded slowly over many months, consistent with the “common contexts” hypothesis but not consistent with the early acquisition predicted by the “common letter name” hypothesis. Evidence from cross-case transfer in a training experiment indicated that prior to acquiring full use of ALUs the children had formed representations of words that were letter based but specific to lower-case forms."

Seidenberg","The development of reading skill and bases of developmental dyslexia were explored using connectionist models. Four issues were examined: the acquisition of phonological knowledge prior to reading, how this knowledge facilitates learning to read, phonological and non phonological bases of dyslexia, and effects of literacy on phonological representation. Compared with simple feedforward networks, representing phonological knowledge in an attractor network yielded improved learning and generalization. Phonological and surface forms of developmental dyslexia, which are usually attributed to impairments in distinct lexical and nonlexical processing “routes,” were derived from different types of damage to the network. The results provide a computationally explicit account of many aspects of reading acquisition using connectionist principles. Phonological information plays a central role in learning to read and in skilled reading. Several converging sources of evidence indicate that learning to relate the spoken and written forms of language is a critical step in learning to read (see Adams, 1990, for an extensive review). Children’ s knowledge of the phonological structure of language is a good predictor of early reading ability (Bradley & Bryant, 1983; Tunmer & Nesdale, 1985; Mann, 1984; Olson, Wise, Conners, Rack, & Fulker, 1989; Shankweiler & Liberman, 1989) and impairments in the representation or processing of phonological information are implicated in at least some forms of developmental dyslexia (Manis, Seidenberg, Doi, McBride-Chang, & Peterson, 1996; Stanovich, Siegel, & Gottardo, 1997).

The results revealed that although both letter-name knowledge and phonological awareness made unique contributions to literacy skills (i.e., word reading, pseudoword reading, and spelling), letter-name knowledge played a more important role than phonological awareness in literacy acquisition in Korean. Letter-name knowledge explained appreciably greater amount of variance and had larger effect sizes in literacy skills. Furthermore, children with greater syllable, body (e.g., segmenting cat into ca-t), and phoneme awareness had higher levels of letter-name knowledge. In particular, children’s syllable awareness and body awareness were positively associated with their letter-name knowledge, even after controlling for children’s phoneme awareness. These results suggest that Korean children’s awareness of larger phonological units (i.e., syllable and body) in addition to phoneme awareness may mediate the relationship between letter-name knowledge and literacy acquisition in Korean, in contrast with previous findings in English that have demonstrated a positive relationship only between phoneme awareness and letter-name knowledge, and the hypothesis that phoneme awareness mediates the relationship between letter-name knowledge and literacy acquisition."

Francis","This study was designed to test the prediction that, whereas sensitivity to subsyllabic phonological units might emerge prior to alphabetic reading instruction, phonemic analysis skills develop as a consequence of reading instruction. A series of phonological oddity tasks was devised, assessing children's sensitivity to subsyllabic onset and rime units, and to phonemes. These tasks were administered to three groups of children. The first group comprised the oldest children of a sample of kindergarten children. The second and third groups comprised the youngest and oldest children from a first-grade sample. The kindergarten group was equivalent to the younger first-grade group in terms of general verbal maturity, but had not been exposed to reading instruction. The younger first-grade sample was verbally less mature than the older first-grade sample, but had equivalent exposure to reading instruction. On all tasks, both first-grade groups performed at equivalent levels, and both groups did better than the kindergarten group. In all groups, onset and rime unity oddity tasks were of equal difficulty, but phoneme oddity tasks were more difficult than rime oddity tasks. Although some of the kindergarten children could reliably focus on onset and rime units, none performed above chance on the phoneme oddity tasks. Further analyses indicated that rime/onset oddity performance explained variation in very early reading achievement more reliably than phoneme oddity performance."

Cohen Mimran,"The purpose of the present study was to examine the contribution of phonological and nonphonological language skills to reading among Hebrew-speaking children with and without reading disabilities (RD) aged 10–13. We expected that the performance of children with RD would be significantly poorer in all of the language processes compared with those of chronological age-matched children with no RD. Also, we expected that nonphonological language skills would contribute unique variance to reading level. The results showed that the most marked predictor for all reading measures was the phonological awareness measure. However, nonphonological language skills also showed a significant contribution to variance in accuracy and rate of reading real words but not to variance in pseudoword reading. The discussion highlights how investigating different orthographic systems can deepen our understanding of the role of the different language processes at play in reading. Our results further stress the importance of using multi-componential reading measures (i.e., pseudowords, real words and reading rate) when analyzing the relationship between reading and language skills."

These matched pairs of children were followed from 1 year before until 1 year after the start of formal literacy instruction. Children with SLI had problems with phonological awareness (PA) and verbal short-term memory (vSTM) in kindergarten. PA and vSTM in kindergarten were not good predictors for dyslexia in children with SLI, but rapid automatized naming (RAN) measured in kindergarten was strongly correlated with reading and spelling in both groups. We can infer that only SLI children who additionally failed on RAN in kindergarten developed reading and spelling problems at the end of Grade 1."

In the current study, we investigated the validity of this hypothesis for Portuguese orthography, which is more consistent than English orthography, by exploring different cognitive profiles in a sample of dyslexic children. In particular, we were interested in identifying readers characterized by a pure rapid automatized naming deficit. We also examined whether rapid naming and phonological awareness independently account for individual differences in reading performance. We characterized the performance of dyslexic readers and a control group of normal readers matched for age on reading, visual rapid naming and phonological processing tasks. Our results suggest that there is a subgroup of dyslexic readers with intact phonological processing capacity (in terms of both accuracy and speed measures) but poor rapid naming skills. We also provide evidence for an independent association between rapid naming and reading competence in the dyslexic sample, when the effect of phonological skills was controlled. Altogether, the results are more consistent with the view that rapid naming problems in dyslexia represent a second core deficit rather than an exclusive phonological explanation for the rapid naming deficits. Furthermore, additional non-phonological processes, which subserve rapid naming performance, contribute independently to reading development."

Brei, Bonita P. Klein-Tasman, G. Nathanael Schwarz, Christina L. Casnar","Abstract In this study, the language abilities of 30 children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) aged 4–6 years were examined using a standardized measure of language. Relations of language to multiple parental report measures of functional communication, social skills, and attention problems were investigated. Difficulties in core language skills were observed, and more than 1/3 of the children struggled on at least one language index. Language abilities were significantly related to parental report of functional communication, social interaction and communication, and social skills, such that language difficulties may be a risk factor for communication and social interaction challenges and communication-related adaptive behavior in children with NF1. Though receptive language abilities were an area of particular difficulty for many children with NF1, they were not significantly related to parental ratings of social functioning and functional communication. Few significant relations were found between language and parent-reported attention problems, although some trends were noted. Hence attention difficulties in children with NF1 may contribute to, but do not appear to fully account for, language difficulties. In sum, there is an increased risk of language difficulties for young children with NF1, and lab-measured language difficulties appear to relate to everyday communication and social interaction functioning."

Macmillan,"There is debate over whether children’s early rhyme awareness has important implications for beginning reading instruction. The apparent finding that pre-readers are able to perform rhyme tasks much more readily than phoneme tasks has led some to propose that teaching children to read by drawing attention to rime units within words is ‘a route into phonemes’ (Goswami, 1999a, p. 233). Rhyme and analogy have been adopted as an integral part of the National Literacy Strategy (DfEE, 1998), a move which appears to have been influenced by three major research claims:1) rhyme awareness is related to reading ability, 2) rhyme awareness affects reading achievement, and 3) rhyme awareness leads to the development of phoneme awareness. A critical examination of the experimental research evidence from a methodological viewpoint, however, shows that not one of the three claims is sufficiently supported. Instructional implications are discussed."

The effects of shared environment on kindergarten reading were estimated at .09 in Australia, .25 in the U.S., and .52 in Scandinavia.

One year later when twins in all three samples had received formal literacy instruction for at least one full school year, heritability was similarly high across country, with estimated genetic influences varying between .79 and .83 for reading and between .62 and .79 for spelling. These findings indicate that the pattern of genetic and environmental influences on early reading and spelling development varies according to educational context, with genetic influence increasing as a function of increasing intensity of early instruction. Longitudinal analyses revealed genetic continuity for both reading and spelling between kindergarten and Grade 1 across country. However, a new genetic factor comes into play accounting for independent variance in reading at Grade 1 in the U.S. and Scandinavia, suggesting a change in genetic influences on reading.

Sixteen dyslexic and 16 control university students were administered a full battery of psychometric, phonological, auditory, visual and cerebellar tests. Individual data reveal that all 16 dyslexics suffer from a phonological deficit, 10 from an auditory deficit, four from a motor deficit and two from a visual magnocellular deficit. Results suggest that a phonological deficit can appear in the absence of any other sensory or motor disorder, and is sufficient to cause a literacy impairment, as demonstrated by five of the dyslexics. Auditory disorders, when present, aggravate the phonological deficit, hence the literacy impairment. However, auditory deficits cannot be characterized simply as rapid auditory processing problems, as would be predicted by the magnocellular theory. Nor are they restricted to speech. Contrary to the cerebellar theory, we find little support for the notion that motor impairments, when found, have a cerebellar origin or reflect an automaticity deficit. Overall, the present data support the phonological theory of dyslexia, while acknowledging the presence of additional sensory and motor disorders in certain individuals."

A broad battery of psychoacoustic measures and standard measures of reading and spelling were applied to 102 adults. The test group included individuals with a childhood history of reading difficulties and controls with no reported reading difficulties. Reading scores were variable in both groups. Poor auditory processing abilities were recorded in poor readers; particular difficulties were posed by tasks requiring spectral distinctions, the simplest of which was pure tone frequency discrimination. In absolute terms, the greatest deficits were recorded in tasks in which stimuli were presented in brief forms and in rapid succession. Auditory processing abilities accounted for more than 50% of the reading score variance in the control group, but their correlation with reading scores was lower in the group with childhood histories of reading difficulties. The additional variability in the latter group resulted largely from the prevalence of reading-compensated poor psychoacoustic performers, whose short-term word memory was also typically poor. Taken together, these findings support a link between impaired auditory resolution and poor reading. Psychoacoustic difficulties are largely retained through adulthood and may be the source of the retained reading difficulties."

Mean RTs of the SLI group were about one fifth slower across tasks than the CA group's mean RTs. Less slowing was evident for a subgroup of young children with expressive SLI than for children with mixed (expressive and receptive) SLI. Although the mean RT data reflected many individual SLI children's RT performance, not all SLI children showed generalized slowing."

McGrath, Bruce F. Pennington, Michelle A. Shanahan, Laura Santerre-Lemmon, Holly D. Barnard, Erik G. Willcutt, John C. DeFries, Richard K. Olson","Reading Disability (RD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are both complex neurobehavioral disorders affecting approximately 5% of children in the population (DSM-IV-TR, APA, 2000). RD and ADHD co-occur more frequently than would be expected by chance (estimates of 25% – 40% in both disorders) (Willcutt & Pennington, 2000). This study presents a multiple cognitive deficit model of RD, ADHD, and their comorbidity.

Multiple deficit models (Pennington, 2006) propose a multifactorial etiology for complex developmental and psychiatric disorders where the constellation of risk and protective factors determines outcome. Comorbidity is to be expected when risk factors are shared between disorders. Despite increasing theoretical and empirical support for multiple deficit models, there has been little research directly evaluating whether such models can account for comorbidity.

Neuropsychological studies of RD, ADHD, and other disorders have primarily focused on identifying cognitive deficits specific to a given disorder. For RD, the deficits identified include phonological awareness (Vellutino, Fletcher, Snowling, & Scanlon, 2004), other aspects of speech and language processing (Bishop & Adams, 1990), naming speed (Compton, Olson, DeFries, & Pennington, 2002; Purvis & Tannock, 2000; Semrud-Clikeman, Guy, Griffin, & Hynd, 2000; Wolf & Bowers, 1999), processing speed (Caravolas, Volin, & Hulme, 2005; Catts, Gillispie, Leonard, Kail, & Miller, 2002; Kail & Hall, 1994; Shanahan et al., 2006; Willcutt, Pennington, Olson, Chhabildas, & Hulslander, 2005), and verbal working memory (Rucklidge & Tannock, 2002; Swanson, Mink, & Bocian, 1999; Willcutt et al., 2001; Willcutt, Pennington et al., 2005).

In the case of ADHD, there is less agreement about neuropsychological deficits. One candidate that has received considerable research attention is executive functioning, most notably response inhibition (Barkley, 1997), but also organization/planning and working memory (Willcutt, Doyle, Nigg, Faraone, & Pennington, 2005). In addition to executive functioning impairments, children with ADHD demonstrate cognitive weaknesses in domains such as processing speed (Shanahan et al., 2006) and naming speed (Rucklidge & Tannock, 2002).

Taken together, these studies identify specific cognitive deficits in RD and ADHD as well as potential shared deficits in processing speed, naming speed, and verbal working memory. Of these deficits, processing speed has also emerged as a candidate shared deficit from studies analyzing combined samples of children with RD and ADHD (Shanahan et al., 2006; Willcutt, Pennington et al., 2005).

The current study has two specific aims. First, we test a multiple cognitive deficit model .of RD and ADHD using structural equation modeling (SEM). Secondly, we test the multiple deficit models of RD and ADHD simultaneously to determine if any of the cognitive dimensions are predictive of both RD and ADHD dimensions. If so, we will explore the extent to which the cognitive factor(s) can account for the observed relationship between the RD and ADHD symptom dimensions. We predict that phonological awareness will be a unique predictor of RD, response inhibition will be a unique predictor of ADHD, and processing speed, naming speed and/or verbal working memory will be potential shared cognitive risk factors."

However, the effects of such cues on word learning during reading remain largely unexplored. This study investigated whether (a) control, (b) phonological, (c) semantic, and (d) combined phonological-semantic conditions affected semantic word learning during reading in 9- to 11-year-old children with LI (n = 12) and with typical language (TL, n = 11) from low-income backgrounds. Children were exposed to 20 novel words across these four conditions prior to reading passages containing the novel words. After reading, a dynamic semantic assessment was given, which included oral definitions, contextual clues, and multiple choices. Results indicated that the LI group performed more poorly than the TL group in phonological and combined conditions, but not in the control or semantic condit..."

Preston, Mary Louise Edwards","Children with residual speech sound errors are often underserved clinically, yet there has been a lack of recent research elucidating the specific deficits in this population. Adolescents aged 10–14 with residual speech sound errors (RE) that included rhotics were compared to normally speaking peers on tasks assessing speed and accuracy of speech production. The two groups were evaluated on an oral diadochokinetic task, which required rapid production of the trisyllable /pΛtΛkΛ/, and two rapid naming tasks: monosyllabic letter names and multisyllabic picture names. No significant group differences were observed in the speed of trisyllables on the DDK task, whether examining all attempts or only correct productions. However, the RE group was less accurate and more variable in their production of the trisyllables. In addition, the RE group was slower and phonologically less accurate in rapidly naming multisyllabic pictures, but not in naming letters. A combination of speed and accuracy measures from these t..."

Huang, Marcia Invernizzi","We investigated five hypotheses related to the successful naming of lowercase letters. Participants included 5,020 first-time kindergarteners from economically disadvantaged homes who previously attended publicly funded preschools. Results analyzed using three-level logistic regression showed that children have a higher probability of correctly identifying letters that appear in their own name and letters that appear frequently in print. In addition, lowercase letter shape similarity to its uppercase counterpart and letter order were also associated with the correct identification of the letter. Finally, if a lowercase letter had a visual and phonological resemblance to other letters, students had a lower probability of identifying the letter correctly. Implications for instruction are discussed."

The success of RTI rests in part on the accuracy of universal screening tools used within this framework. Despite advancements, screening instruments designed to identify children at risk for reading disabilities continue to have limited predictive validity. In this study, the authors examined a common screening instrument for the presence of floor effects and investigated the impact that these effects have on the predictive validity of the instrument. Longitudinal data (kindergarten to third grade) from a large cohort of children were used. These data included children's performance on five measures from the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) and two reading achievement outcome measures. The results showed that DIBELS measures were characterized by floor effects in their initial administrations and that these effects reduced the predictive validity of the measure..."

The data were collected at the end of Grades 1–4 (about 100 children for each level). EVALEC includes four tests focused on written word processing (three reading aloud tests, one silent reading test); both accuracy scores and processing time (time latency and vocal response duration for the reading aloud tests) were recorded. EVALEC also includes tests of phonemic and syllabic awareness, phonological short-term memory, and rapid naming; the latter test is presented in non-reading and in reading contexts in order to compare the impact of the time constraint in both domains. We assessed the effects of regularity (regular vs. irregular words), graphemic length and graphemic complexity (regular words with only single letter graphemes vs. those with digraphs such as “ch” and those with contextual graphemes such as “g”) on the reading of high frequency words. We also compared the effect of graphemic length and graphemic complexity on regular word versus pseudoword reading as well as the effect of the length of the items (short vs. long items) on irregular word versus pseudoword reading. According to the ANOVAs, for word reading, the effects of sublexical factors appeared stronger for the youngest children, but regular words were always read better and faster than irregular words. However, these lexical factors did not have the same effect for words and pseudowords. Their impact, when positive, was greater for words (e.g. the graphemic length), while the negative effects were especially marked for pseudowords (e.g. the length of the items). Among the correlations, those between accuracy and latency time were never significant for the youngest children, thus suggesting that some beginning readers favored accuracy to the detriment of speed while others adopted the opposite strategy. Concerning the correlations between the reading and the reading-related tests, only the correlations between phonemic awareness and reading were significant and only with the youngest children. In addition, the correlations between the two rapid naming tests (reading and non-reading tests) were not significant most of the time. These data would allow researchers and speech therapists to assess the reading and reading-related skills of dyslexics as compared to average readers. © 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved."

At that time, although matched for nonverbal IQ (mean 92–93) and expressive language, the Language group showed significantly fewer social and behavioural problems. At follow-up, when aged on average, 23 to 24 years, the Autism group continued to show significantly more impairments in terms of stereotyped behaviour patterns, social relationships, jobs, and independence. However, problems in all these areas were also common in the Language group. Many still lived with their parents, few had close friends or permanent jobs, and ratings of social interaction indicated abnormalities in a number of different areas. On a composite measure of social competence only 10% of the Language group was assessed as having severe social difficulties compared to 74% of the Autism group. Nevertheless, 65% were rated as having moderate social problems and only 25% were rated as being of near/normal social functioning. Two individuals in the Language group, but none in the Autism group, had also developed a florid paranoid psychosis in late adolescence.

As in the follow-up of cognitive and linguistic functioning (see Mawhood et al., 2000, this volume, pp. 547–559), discriminant function analysis, which had clearly distinguished between the groups as children, now showed much greater overlap between them. Regression analysis indicated that although early language ability appeared to be related to outcome in the Autism group, there was little association between any measures of childhood functioning and prognosis in the Language group. Theoretically, these findings have implications for our understanding of the nature of autism and other pervasive language disorders, and of the relationship between them. Practically, they demonstrate the very persistent problems experienced by individuals with developmental language disorders, and their need for much greater help and support than is presently available."

Fletcher","This study evaluated the validity, reliability, and utility of five of the six subtests of Clay's (2002) Observation Survey of Early Literacy Achievement (OS), including Letter Identification, Word Reading, Writing Vocabulary, Hearing and Recording Sounds in Words, and Text Reading. In addition to a review of studies providing assessment of the reliability and validity of the OS, we analyzed (a) the concurrent validity of the OS subtests relative to other instruments with known psychometric properties, (b) their validity and accuracy as predictors of reading development in grade 1, and (c) interadministrator reliability for the Text Reading and Writing Vocabulary subtests. The score distributions of most of the OS subtests indicated inadequate floors and ceilings, suggesting that when the OS subtests are scored as recommended in the manual, they are not suitable for program evaluation. Analyses of predictive validity indicated that decisions based on the attainment of established benchmarks in OS Word Identification, Text Reading, and Writing Vocabulary would be valid for early screening purposes and to evaluate student outcomes, but more work needs to be done in setting benchmarks for these subtests. In addition to this evidence for predictive validity, there was evidence for concurrent validity of the OS. Interassessor reliability was high for both the Text Reading and Writing Vocabulary subtests in our sample. Our review of the characteristics and administration procedures of each subtest suggests cautions regarding the utility of some of the measures for diagnostic assessment and progress monitoring. Overall, with some limitations, the OS can be validly implemented to assess components of early reading development.

Este estudio evaluo la validez, confiabilidad y utilidad de cinco de los seis subtests del Informe de Observacion de la Alfabetizacion Temprana (OS) de Clay (2002). Los tests incluyen Identificacion de Letras, Lectura de Palabras, Vocabulario Escrito, Escuchar y Grabar Sonidos y Lectura de Textos. Ademas de revisar estudios que evaluan la confiabilidad y validez del OS, analizamos: (a) la validez concurrente de los subtests del OS en relacion a otros instrumentos de conocidas propiedades psicometricas, (b) la validez y precision como predictores del desarrollo lector en 1° Grado y (c) la validez inter-evaluador en los tests de Lectura de Textos y Vocabulario Escrito. Las distribuciones de los valores de la mayoria de los subtets de OS indicaron efectos techo y piso inadecuados, lo que sugiere que cuando los subtests de OS se computan como se recomienda en el manual, no son adecuados para la evaluacion. Los analisis de la validez predictiva indicaron que las decisiones basadas en alcanzar los estandares establecidos para Identificacion de Palabras, Lectura de Textos y Vocabulario Escrito serian validas solo en los procedimientos iniciales de evaluacion y al evaluar los resultados finales. No obstante se requiere mas trabajo para establecer los estandares de estos subtests. Ademas de evidencia sobre la validez predictiva, se hallo evidencia de la validez concurrente de OS. La confiabilidad inter-evaluador fue alta tanto para el subtest de Lectura de Textos como para el de Vocabulario Escrito. La revision de las caracteristicas y procedimientos de administracion de cada subtest sugiere tener cautela con respecto a la utilidad de algunas de estas medidas para evaluacion diagnostica y control del progreso. En sintesis, con ciertas limitaciones, el OS se puede implementar con validez para evaluar los componentes del desarrollo de la lectura inicial.

In Erganzung zu einer Uberprufung der Studien, die eine Bewertung uber die Zuverlassigkeit und Validitat der OS liefern, analysierten wir (a) die ubereinstimmende Gultigkeit der OS Abstufungstests relativ zu anderen Mitteln mit bekannten psychometrischen Eigenschaften, (b) ihre Gultigkeit und Genauigkeit als Voraussage zur Leseentwicklung in der ersten Schulklasse, und (c) ihre inter-administrative Verlaslichkeit fur das Textlesen und das Schreiben von Vokabel-Abstufungstests. Die Auswertungen der erzielten Leistungen der meisten OS Abstufungstests zeigten unzureichende Tiefen- und Hohenschwingungen auf, was darauf schliesen last, vorausgesetzt die OS Abstufungstests werden wie im Anweisungshandbuch bewertet, das sie nicht zur Programmbewertung geeignet sind. Analysen von aussagekraftiger Gultigkeit zeigten auf, das Entscheidungen, die auf das Erreichen von festgelegten Markierungswerten der OS Worterkennung basierten, beim Textlesen und Schreiben von Vokabeln fur fruhzeitige Unterscheidungszwecke und zur Bewertung von Schulerergebnissen von Wert sein konnten, jedoch mus noch mehr Vorarbeit bei der Festsetzung von Markierungswerten fur die Abstufungstests erfolgen. In Erganzung zu dieser Tatsache uber eine vorhersagbare Gultigkeit gab es Anzeichen einer ubereinstimmenden Gultigkeit der OS. Die Zuverlassigkeit der Bewerter untereinander war sowohl beim Textlesen als auch beim Vokabelschreiben bei den Abstufungstests in unserem Musterbeispiel hoch. Unsere Uberprufung der Charakteristiken und administrativen Handhabungen jedes einzelnen Abstufungstests schlagt Vorsicht in der Anwendung einiger der Bewertungsmasstabe zur diagnostischen Einschatzung und bei der Fortschrittsuberwachung vor. Insgesamt, mit einigen Einschrankungen, kann OS stichhaltig zur Begutachtung von Komponenten der fruhen Leseentwicklung eingesetzt werden.

Outre un etat de la question des etudes relatives a la validite et a la validite du QO, nous avons analyse a) la validite concourante des sous-tests par rapport a d'autres instruments aux proprietes psychometriques connues, b) leur validite et leur pertinence predictive pour l'acquisition de la lecture en premiere annee, et c) la fidelite inter-administrateurs de l'epreuve pour les sous-tests de lecture de texte et de vocabulaire de l'ecriture. La distribution des scores de la plupart des sous-tests du QO a indique des effets inadequats de plancher et de plafond, ce qui suggere que quand les sous-tests sont calcules comme il est recommande dans le manuel, ils ne sont pas adaptes a l'evaluation du programme. Les analyses de la validite predictive ont indique que les decisions basees sur l'atteinte des seuils indiques dans le QO pour l'identification des lettres, la lecture de texte, et le vocabulaire de l'ecriture, peuvent etre valides pour effectuer un examen precoce ou pour evaluer les resultats de l'apprentissage, mais qu'il reste du travail a faire pour que des seuils puissent etre etablis pour ces sous-tests. Outre ces resultats relatifs a la validite predictive, on dispose de resultats relatifs a la validite concurrente du QO. La fidelite inter-evaluateurs est elevee tant pour les sous-tests de lecture de texte que de vocabulaire de l'ecriture dans notre echantillon. Notre examen des proprietes et des procedures d'administration de chaque sous-test incite a la prudence en ce qui concerne l'utilite de certaines mesures pour la realisation du diagnostic et le pilotage de la progression. De maniere generale, et dans certaines limites, le QO peut etre valide pour evaluer certaines composantes du debut de l'acquisition de la lecture."

In a sample of 127 children, these cognitive preconditions were assessed before the onset of formal education, whereas reading as well as spelling achievement was measured at the end of grade 1. The findings indicate that working memory does contribute to the prediction of early reading and spelling, and that this contribution outperforms that of general intelligence and phonological recoding from long-term memory during the early steps of reading and spelling acquisition. Moreover, the results show that phonological awareness mediates the effects of working memory capacities on early literacy outcomes. The role of working memory and phonological awareness as key cognitive preconditions of early reading and spelling are discussed."

A total of 308 preparatory students attending 30 public schools in northern Tasmania were administered assessments by a speech-language pathologist, and subsequently diagnosed with either typical or impaired speech and/or language skills. Overall, 41.2% of assessed preparatory students were identified as having either speech and/or language impairment. Specifically, 8.7% of students were found to have isolated speech impairment, 18.2% were diagnosed with isolated language impairment, and 14.3% were identified as having comorbid speech and language impairment. Compared to prior Australian and international research, the present data reflect one of the highest prevalence estimates for speech and/or language impairment reported to date. Given the relative paucity of Australian prevalence data, further epidemiological research specifically of Australian children is needed to validate the current findings."

In a homogeneous set of U.S. studies with a randomized or matched design, the combined effect sizes for phonological awareness and reading were d = 0.73 (r = .34, N = 739) and d = 0.70 (r = .33, N = 745), respectively. Thus, experimentally manipulated phonological awareness explains about 12% of the variance in word-identification skills. The combined effect size for long-term studies of the influence of phonological awareness training on reading was much smaller, d = 0.16 (r = .08, N = 1,180). Programs combining a phonological and a letter training were more effective than a purely phonological training. Furthermore, training effects were stronger with posttests assessing simple decoding skills than with real-word-identification tests. In sum, phonological awareness is an important but not a sufficient condition for early reading."

We assessed the contribution of maternal spelling support in predicting children’s word spelling level beyond the contribution of three internal child measures: early literacy (phonological awareness and letter naming), private speech while spelling (self-directed talk), and behavioral regulation. Children’s private speech during spelling—their tool to regulate thinking—has not yet been studied in the early literacy context. Fifty Israeli preschoolers (M = 68.66 months) of middle-high SES were videotaped while spelling words with their mothers and while spelling these words independently. Children’s phonological awareness, letter naming, and behavioral regulation were assessed individually. Results showed that children’s internal measures (early literacy, private speech while spelling, and behavioral regulation) predicted children’s early spelling (63 % of the variance), and the external measure of maternal spelling support added uniquely (12 %), together explaining 75 % of the variance in children’s spelling level. Findings suggested that mothers adjust their spelling support to meet young children’s existing literacy skills but also coach children to strive toward higher spelling performance. Furthermore, the study illuminates the role of a new measure in the context of children’s early literacy—private speech during spelling."

A secondary purpose was to examine the effects of stimu- lus characteristics on responsiveness to the phonological awareness intervention via post-hoc analysis. A single-subject design was used to examine treatment effects among children with varying levels of communicative abilities. The PASS blending module was implemented with 11 children with speech and/or language impairments, following the establishment of a stable pretreatment baseline on a series of phonological awareness probes. After instruction, the children demonstrated substantial improvement in their blending ability, which appeared to be attributable to the intervention rather than environmental or maturational factors. These findings suggest that PASS blending training was an effective approach to phonological awareness instruction for the preschoolers with disabilities in our sample. Additionally, word frequency and neighborhood density were found to influence performance on some phonological awareness tasks. Specifically, children correctly blended high-frequency words more than low-frequency words, but they correctly blended words from lower-density neighborhoods more than words from higher-density neighborhoods. Findings are discussed with respect to predictions of the lexical restructuring hypothesis."

They culminate in a representation of letter strings as an ordered set of abstract letter identities, a representation known as the Visual Word Form (VWF). Brain lesions in patients with pure alexia and functional imaging data suggest that the VWF is subtended by a restricted patch of left‐hemispheric fusiform cortex, which is reproducibly activated during reading. In order to determine whether the operation of this Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) depends exclusively on the visual features of stimuli, or is influenced by language‐dependent parameters, brain activations induced by words, consonant strings and chequerboards were compared in normal subjects using functional MRI (fMRI). Stimuli were presented in the left or right visual hemifield. The VWFA was identified in both a blocked‐design experiment and an event‐related experiment as a left‐hemispheric inferotemporal area showing a stronger activation to alphabetic strings than to chequerboards, and invariant for the spatial location of stimuli. In both experiments, stronger activations of the VWFA to words than to strings of consonants were observed. Considering that the VWFA is equally activated by real words and by readable pseudowords, this result demonstrates that the VWFA is initially plastic and becomes attuned to the orthographic regularities that constrain letter combination during the acquisition of literacy. Additionally, the use of split‐field stimulation shed some light on the cerebral bases of the classical right visual field (RVF) advantage in reading. A left occipital extrastriate area was found to be activated by RVF letter strings more than by chequerboards, while no symmetrical region was observed in the right hemisphere. Moreover, activations in the precuneus and the left thalamus were observed when subjects were reading RVF versus left visual field (LVF) words, and are likely to reflect the attentional component of the RVF advantage."

Within the case group we compared the performance of children distinguished by location of suture fusion (sagittal, metopic, unicoronal, lambdoid). METHODS: We administered standardized tests of intelligence, reading, spelling, and math to 182 case participants and 183 control participants. This sample represented 70% of those tested during infancy before case participants had corrective surgery. RESULTS: After adjustment for demographics, case participants’ average scores were lower than those of control participants on all measures. The largest observed differences were in Full-Scale IQ and math computation, where case participants’ adjusted mean scores were 2.5 to 4 points lower than those of control participants ( P s ranged from .002 to .09). Adjusted mean case–control differences on other measures of achievement were modest, although case deficits became more pronounced after adjustment for participation in developmental interventions. Among case participants, 58% had no discernible learning problem (score P s ranged from CONCLUSIONS: The developmental delays observed among infants with single-suture craniosynostosis are partially evident at school age, as manifested by lower average scores than those of control participants on measures of IQ and math. However, case participants’ average scores were only slightly lower than those of control participants on reading and spelling measures, and the frequency of specific learning problems was comparable. Among case participants, those with unicoronal and lambdoid fusions appear to be the most neurodevelopmentally vulnerable."

Longitudinal language-test data on 87 language-impaired children assessed at the ages of four, 4half;and 5 ½years were converted to age-equivalent scores to compare the rates of development of children who recover from early language delay with those who have more persisting problems. On most measures, over the 18-month period all the children progressed by about 18 months. Thus although children with good and poor outcomes were distinguished in terms of initial level of performance, they did not differ in rate of progress. Speed on a peg-moving task was closely related to language performance. Children who had a good outcome after early language delay had significantly impaired scores at four years, but subsequently were indistinguishable from a control group. Quantitative but not qualitative differences in peg-moving performance were found for children with good and poor outcomes. No association was found between presumptive aetiological factors and language or pegboard performance. These findings are interpreted in terms of a theory which attributes specific language impairment to a maturational lag in neurological development.

In diesen 18 Monaten haben alle Kinder in den meisten Punkten schlielsich Fortschritte gemacht. Obwohl also die Kinder mit gutem wie mit schlechtem Outcome in Bezug auf den anfanglichen Leistungsstand zu unterscheiden waren, unterschieden sie sich nicht in der Fortschrittsrate. Die Geschwindigkeit bei Aufgaben, die die viso-motorische Koordination betreffen, stand in enger Relation zu den sprachlichen Leistungen. Kinder, die nach anfanglicher Sprachverzogerung einen guten Outcome hatten, hatten mit vier Jahren signifikant herabgesetzte Scores, waren aber im weiteren Verlauf von den Kontrollen nicht zu unterscheiden. Bei den Aufgaben, die die viso-motorische Koordination betreffen, fanden sich quantitative aber keine qualitativen Unterschiede bei Kindern mit guten wie mit schlechten Outcomes. Diese Befunde werden im Sinne einer Theorie interpretiert, die die spezifische Sprachstorung einer Reifungsverzogerung in der neurologischen Entwicklung zuordnet.



RESUMEN

Alteracion especifica del lenguaje como fallo madurativo: evidencia a partir de datos longitudinales sobre el lenguaje y el desarrollo motor



Los datos de un test longitudinal del lenguaje realizado en 87 niflos con alteracion del lenguaje, evaluados a la edad de cuatro, cuatro y medio y cinco anos y medio fueron convertidos en puntajes equivalentes de edad para comparar los porcentajes de desarrollo de niflos en fase de recuperacion de un retraso precoz del lenguaje, con los de aquellos que tienen problemas persistentes. En la mayoria de las mediciones, mas alia de los 18 meses todos los ninos progresaban alrededor de 18 meses. Asi a pesar de que los niflos con un curso rico o pobre se distinguian en terminos de niveies iniciales de realizacion, no difirieron en el porcentaje de progreso. La velocidad en una tarea movil estaba en intima relaci6n con la ejecucion del lenguaje. Los niflos que tenian un buen curso posterior despues de un retraso precoz del lenguaje, tenian unos puntajes significativamente afectados a los cuatro aflos, pero posteriormente no se distinguian del grupo control. Se hallaron diferencias cuantitativas pero no cualitativas en la ejecucion movil en ninos con curso posterior bueno o malo. Estos hallazgos se interpretan de acuerdo con una teoria que atribuye la alteracion especifica del lenguaje a un fallo madurativo en el desarrollo neurologico."

Mothers and children were videotaped at home in a book reading activity, and HLE data were gathered from the mothers. One year later, the children’s literacy level was assessed in first grade. Results show that mothers often used paraphrasing in the reading activities and dealt less with the written language. Correlations were found between SES and children’s literacy measures in oral and written language in kindergarten and in first grade. Significant positive relationships were found between HLE and children’s literacy level in kindergarten and first grade. No relationship was found between maternal mediation and children’s spoken and written language skills in either age group. Regression analysis showed that HLE was the best"
1498,2170189108,prediction of first grade reading achievement a comparison of fall and winter kindergarten screenings,2003,10.2307/1593651,Learning Disability Quarterly,Anne G. Bishop,"Abstract. The purpose of this study was threefold: (a) to identify a combination of predictive measures that correlate with reading achievement, (b) to examine the predictive accuracy of these measures, and (c) to determine the most accurate time frame for test administration in kindergarten. One hundred and three kindergarten students from three schools participated over a period of two years. Measures representing letter identification, phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming were administered in the fall and winter of the kindergarten year. Reading achievement was measured at the end of grade 1 using measures that included passage comprehension, fluency, sight-word recognition, and phonemic decoding. Five predictive models representing a combination of the predictive constructs were analyzed. The model combining letter identification, phonological awareness, and rapid automatized naming was identified as the best predictor of early reading achievement. There was no practical, significant difference between the fall and winter testing time frames. These findings hold important implications for predictive research by clarifying the importance of administering standardized measures that reflect the reading process. Most important, the results can provide practitioners with information for identifying the children most in need of early reading interventions. ********** Early identification of children most at risk of reading failure is central to the prevention of illiteracy, a national priority hallmarked in the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB, 2001). This legislation sets high academic standards for students, requiring all to become proficient readers by the end of third grade, irrespective of their background knowledge upon kindergarten entry. Reading research demonstrates that the first step in preventing reading disabilities is identification and intervention at the earliest possible stage (Adams, 1990; Juel, 1988; Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998; Torgesen, 1998). Results from numerous early-intervention studies are encouraging. For example, Foorman, Francis, Shaywitz, Shaywitz, and Fletcher (1997) report that 82% of remedial children can become successful readers if intervention is provided in the early grades; only 46%, however, can be effectively remediated at grades 3-5. The success rate drops to 10%-15% in the later grades. At the earliest years, if instruction is not provided to develop the skills central to fluent reading, reading failure is inevitable (Lyon, 1999). Clearly, accurate early identification of problem readers is essential. The reading research community has come a long way in the past decade in determining effective interventions for young, struggling readers. An extensive review of reading research focusing on the primary grades by the National Research Council, and the subsequent work by the National Reading Panel, found that early intervention and prevention can resolve the majority of reading problems in our nation today (National Reading Panel, 2000; Snow et al., 1998). Challenges, unfortunately, remain. To intervene efficiently and appropriately, assessment and identification of problem readers at the earliest stage is essential (Adams, 1990; Juel, 1988; Lyon, 1999; Snow et al., 1998; Stanovich, 1986). Simply put, ""in order to efficiently remediate, we must identify the right children at the right time"" (Torgesen, 1998, p. 34). The challenging search for precise identification measures that identify the right children has spanned the past 75 years. Multiple constructs have been investigated, including mental maturity (Deputy, 1930), readiness skills (e.g., Dystra, 1966), letter naming (e.g., Chall, 1967), language (e.g., Carts, 1991), print concepts (e.g., Clay, 1981), familial factors (e.g., Scarborough, 1989), and, most recently, phonological processing skills (e.g., Wagner, Torgesen, Rashotte, Hecht, Barker, Burgess, Donahue, & Garon, 1997). …"

Parent speech might include information about the similarity between print and speech and about the difference between writing and drawing. Parents could convey similarity between print and speech by using the words say, name ,a ndword to refer to both spoken and written language. Parents could differentiate writing and drawing by making syntactic and semantic distinctions in their discussion of the two symbol systems. Our results indicate that parent speech includes these types of information. However, young children themselves sometimes confuse writing and drawing in their speech."

The effects of the spelling mediation routines were assessed beyond the contribution of the students' self-regulation and baseline literacy levels. Participants (N = 197, mean age = 5.5 years) were randomly divided into four groups within each of 10 classrooms. Three groups underwent individual intervention sessions of inventing five words' spellings twice weekly for 16 weeks. Group 1 experienced process–product mediation, providing information both on the process of inventing spelling (sound-to-grapheme mapping) and on the product (naming the letters and spelling the word). Group 2 experienced product mediation only. Group 3 experienced spelling with no mediation. Group 4 (no intervention) experienced the regular kindergarten curriculum. Results indicate that the process–product mediation routine was most productive for all students, both in the short and long term, beyond their self-regulation and baseline early literacy levels. Students who started with higher self-regulation and poorer early literacy skills gained more from training. The results question the assumption, shared by previous studies, that promotion of invented spelling should be by providing students with one-step-up solutions to compare with those they produced, because the process–product mediation was most productive for students of a wide range of spelling levels.



本研究比较不同的干预教学对来自低社会经济地位家庭的幼稚园学生的学习成绩的影响。学习成绩包括学生的创造拼写的尝试,以及拼写能力与其他初期识字技能(字母名称,字母发音、单词音素分解、单词拼读解码等)方面所得到的改进。不同的拼字干预教学效能的评估,都是根据学生的自我调整能力和基线读写水平范围以外所得到的改进为凖。参加研究的学生来自10个教室(人数=197,平均年龄=5.5岁),他们被随机分为四组。其中三组在16周内每周两次接受个人干预教学,每次尝试创造5个单词的拼写。第一组学生接受学习过程与结果的干预,教学内容提供有关创造拼写过程的知识(发音与字素对应规则)和有关拼写学习结果的知识(读出字母名称和单字的拼写)。第二组只接受学习结果的干预教学。第三组没有接受干预教学,只经历拼写学习。第四组(无干预教学)只学习惯常的幼稚园课程学习。研究结果显示,学习过程与结果的干预教学,无论就短期和长期而言,对所有学生产生最大的成效,而这些成效均超越了学生的自我调整能力和基线读写水平范围以外。从训练中能获益较多的,是那些开始时有较高的自我调整能力但较低的早期读写能力的学生。由于学习过程与结果的干预教学,对广泛不同拼写水平的学生都能产生最大的成效,这些结果令人质疑以前的研究所赞同的假设,认为促进学生创造拼写是应该通过为他们提供一步向上的答案,好让他们用以比较自己创造的拼写。



Este estudio compara los efectos de diferentes rutinas de mediacion que se les dieron a estudiantes de jardin de ninos de familias de bajo nivel socioeconomico en cuanto a los intentos de dichos estudiantes de inventar ortografia y los avances logrados en la ortografia y otras habilidades tempranas de alfabetizacion (nombrar las letras, el sonido de las letras, los segmentos de las palabras, y el desciframiento de palabras). Los efectos de las rutinas de mediacion ortografica fueron evaluados mas alla de la contribucion de la regulacion propia y el nivel de base de alfabetizacion de los estudiantes. Los participantes (N = 197, edad media = 5.5 anos) fueron divididos al azar en cuatro grupos en cada una de 10 aulas. Tres de los grupos recibieron sesiones de intervencion individual para inventar la ortografia de cinco palabras dos veces por semana por 16 semanas. Al Grupo 1 se le dio mediacion de proceso-producto, dandoles informacion tanto del proceso de inventar ortografia (delineando del sonido al grafema) como el producto (nombrando las letras y deletreando la palabra). Al Grupo 2 solo se le dio mediacion del producto. Al Grupo 3 se le dio la ortografia sin mediacion. Al Grupo 4 (sin intervencion) se le dio el curso corriente. Los resultados indican que la rutina de mediacion proceso-producto fue la mas productiva para todos los estudiantes, tanto a corto como a largo plazo, mas alla de la regulacion propia y el nivel de base de alfabetizacion de los estudiantes. Los que empezaron con mayor regulacion propia y peor habilidad de temprana alfabetizacion fueron los que mas ventaja sacaron del entrenamiento. Los resultados ponen en tela de juicio la creencia, compartida por estudios anteriores, que fomentar la invencion de ortografia deberia hacerse dandoles a los estudiantes soluciones de un-paso-mas-alla para que lo puedan comparar con lo que han producido, porque la mediacion de proceso-producto era mas productiva para los estudiantes de una gama extensa de niveles de ortografia.

Cette recherche compare les effets de differentes demarches de mediation qui ont ete appliquees a des enfants d’ecole maternelle de milieu social defavorise lors de leurs tentatives d’ecriture inventee et les benefices qu'ils en ont retire en matiere d’ecriture et dans d'autres competences relatives a l'entree dans l’ecrit (denomination des lettres, son des lettres, segmentation des mots et decodage des mots). Les effets des demarches de mediation de l’ecriture ont ete evaluees au-dela de l'auto-regulation des eleves et le leur niveau de depart en langue ecrite. On a reparti de facon aleatoire les participants (N = 197, moyenne d’âge, 5.5 ans) en quatre groupes au sein de chacune des 10 classes. Trois groupes ont suivi des sessions d'intervention individuelle d'invention de l’ecriture de cinq mots a raison de deux fois par semaine pendant seize semaines. Le groupe 1 a suivi une mediation processus-produit, en recevant une information a la fois sur le processus d'invention de l’ecriture (planification pour aller du son au grapheme) et sur le produit (denomination des lettres et ecriture du mot). Le groupe 2 a suivi uniquement la mediation sur le produit. Le groupe 3 a ecrit sans mediation. Le groupe 4 (pas d'intervention) a suivi le programme scolaire habituel. Les resultats montrent que la demarche processus- produit donne les meilleurs resultats avec tous les eleves, a court et a long terme, au-dela de leur auto-regulation et de leur niveau de depart en langue ecrite. Les eleves qui ont commence avec un haut niveau de regulation et des competences limitees en langue ecrite sont ceux qui ont le plus beneficie de cette activite. Ces resultats mettent en question l'idee, que l'on trouve dans les etudes anterieures, selon laquelle pour progresser dans l’ecriture inventee il faut presenter aux enfants la reponse toute prete pour la comparer avec la leur, car la demarche processus-produit s'est revelee plus efficace chez les eleves ayant des niveaux d’ecriture tres divers."
1502,2170893155,analyzing the development of individual differences in terms of matthew effects in reading results from a dutch longitudinal study,1998,10.1037//0012-1649.34.6.1373,Developmental Psychology,"Janwillem Bast, P. H. Reitsma","The Matthew effect hypothesis provides a theoretical framework to describe the development of individual differences in reading ability. The model predicts an increase of individual differences in reading. Reciprocal relationships between reading and other factors seem to cause these increasing differences. This longitudinal study of 3 years was concerned with uncovering the existence and causes of increasing individual differences in reading in the early elementary grades. Data were analyzed within a structural equation modeling framework. The results clearly indicate increasing individual differences for word recognition skills. For reading comprehension, no such effects could be established for this limited time period. More important, some evidence for interactive relationships between reading and other cognitive skills, behaviors, and motivational factors, hypothesized to cause increasing differences between readers, was found. It is evident that not all children become proficient readers. How do individual differences in reading performance come into existence? For most children, reading development starts at school with formal education in Grade 1. However, the development of skills necessary to acquire reading skills starts well before the beginning of formal instruction in reading. Already before children enter school, large differences among them exist as a result of innate competencies and the quality and intensity of parental care invested in them (Walberg & Tsai, 1983). Taking initial differences between individuals as a starting point, the question is whether these differences remain stable or whether individuals converge or diverge in level of performance with further instruction in reading. Stability of individual differences, that is, a relative consistency of individual differences over age, has frequently been found in longitudinal studies of reading (Butler, Marsh, Sheppard, & Sheppard, 1985; Juel, 1994). However, this stability refers only to the rank ordering of participants within a certain population. The absolute performance difference between readers can increase or decline in the course of development as a result of interindividu al differences in intraindividu al change. Individual differences in reading ability do not seem to disappear with further development or to diminish over the years. Even among college students, large individual differences in their reading skills are still found (Perfetti, 1985). Thus, a decrease in variance with time is not to be expected. Instead of a decline,"

Results showed that children’s exposure to books was related to the development of vocabulary and listening comprehension skills, and that these language skills were directly related to children’s reading in grade 3. In contrast, parent involvement in teaching children about reading and writing words was related to the development of early literacy skills. Early literacy skills directly predicted word reading at the end of grade 1 and indirectly predicted reading in grade 3. Word reading at the end of grade 1 predicted reading comprehension in grade 3. Thus, the various pathways that lead to fluent reading have their roots in different aspects of children’s early experiences."
1504,2171036725,reading comprehension and its underlying components in second language learners a meta analysis of studies comparing first and second language learners,2014,10.1037/a0033890,Psychological Bulletin,"Monica Melby-Lervåg, Arne Lervåg","We report a systematic meta-analytic review of studies comparing reading comprehension and its underlying components (language comprehension, decoding, and phonological awareness) in first- and second-language learners. The review included 82 studies, and 576 effect sizes were calculated for reading comprehension and underlying components. Key findings were that, compared to first-language learners, second-language learners display a medium-sized deficit in reading comprehension (pooled effect size d 0.62), a large deficit in language comprehension (pooled effect size d 1.12), but only small differences in phonological awareness (pooled effect size d ‐ 0.08) and decoding (pooled effect size d ‐ 0.12). A moderator analysis showed that characteristics related to the type of reading comprehension test reliably explained the variation in the differences in reading comprehension between first- and second-language learners. For language comprehension, studies of samples from low socioeconomic backgrounds and samples where only the first language was used at home generated the largest group differences in favor of first-language learners. Test characteristics and study origin reliably contributed to the variations between the studies of language comprehension. For decoding, Canadian studies showed group differences in favor of second-language learners, whereas the opposite was the case for U.S. studies. Regarding implications, unless specific decoding problems are detected, interventions that aim to ameliorate reading comprehension problems among second-language learners should focus on language comprehension skills."

Ziolkowski, Howard Goldstein",Efficacy of an explicit phonological awareness intervention embedded within repeated shared book reading with preschool children from low-income backgrounds with language delays was investigated. A multiple-baseline design across behaviors assessed the effects of phonological awareness training on rhyme and letter-sound knowledge with 13 preschool children with language delays from high-poverty communities. Rhyme intervention improved children's rhyme production and rhyme identification. Initial sound intervention enhanced children's alliteration and initial sound fluency skills. These effects were replicated within and across all 13 participants. Classroom teachers perceived meaningful changes in rhyme and letter-sound production. Interventionists and teachers reported high satisfaction with the procedures. Embedding an explicit phonological awareness intervention into repeated storybook reading resulted in improved emergent literacy skills for children at high risk for reading disorders.

Bishop","In this article, we critically review the evidence for overlap among three developmental disorders, namely speech sound disorder (SSD), language impairment (LI), and reading disability (RD), at three levels of analysis: diagnostic, cognitive, and etiological. We find that while overlap exists at all three levels, it varies by comorbidity subtype, and the relations among these three disorders are complex and not fully understood. We evaluate which comorbidity models can be rejected or supported as explanations for why and how these three disorders overlap and what new data are needed to better define their relations."

The results revealed that 1) all literacy skills were related to sums (non-symbolic and story condition), 2) rhyming was the strongest predictor of non-symbolic sums, and letter knowledge of sums in story context, 3) visual-spatial skills explained part of the shared variance in the non-symbolic condition and visualspatial skills, vocabulary and short-term memory explained part of the shared variance in sums in story context. Implications for the preschool curriculum and early interventions are discussed."
1508,2172006752,a comparative quantitative analysis of greek orthographic transparency,2009,10.3758/BRM.41.4.991,Behavior Research Methods,"Athanassios Protopapas, Eleni L. Vlahou","Orthographic transparency refers to the systematicity in the mapping between orthographic letter sequences and phonological phoneme sequences in both directions, for reading and spelling. Measures of transparency previously used in the analysis of orthographies of other languages include regularity, consistency, and entropy. However, previous reports have typically been hampered by severe restrictions, such as using only monosyllables or only word-initial phonemes. Greek is sufficiently transparent to allow complete sequential alignment between graphemes and phonemes, therefore permitting full analyses at both letter and grapheme levels, using every word in its entirety. Here, we report multiple alternative measures of transparency, using both type and token counts, and compare these with estimates for other languages. We discuss the problems stemming from restricted analysis sets and the implications for psycholinguistic experimentation and computational modeling of reading and spelling."

Children at high and low risk for dyslexia were followed and compared at four different moments: kindergarten and first, third and sixth grades. Three groups were then compared: (1) dyslexic readers; (2) normal readers at high risk for dyslexia; and (3) normal readers at low risk for dyslexia. Children diagnosed with dyslexia scored lower than high-risk normal readers on phonological awareness (PA), rapid automatized naming (RAN), verbal short-term memory and literacy skills. Normal readers at high risk scored between both groups, confirming that dyslexia is to be considered as a continuum rather than an all-or-none condition. Growth analyses showed that the three groups evolved similarly on all measures except for phoneme deletion and literacy measures. Finally, solely PA and RAN explained a significant amount of variance in the evolution of reading skills. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Adlof, Tiffany P. Hogan, Susan Ellis Weismer","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether specific language impairment (SLI) and dyslexia are distinct developmental disorders. Method: Study 1 investigated the overlap between SLI identified in kindergarten and dyslexia identified in 2nd, 4th, or 8th grades in a representative sample of 527 children. Study 2 examined phonological processing in a subsample of participants, including 21 children with dyslexia only, 43 children with SLI only, 18 children with SLI and dyslexia, and 165 children with typical language/reading development. Measures of phonological awareness and nonword repetition were considered. Results: Study 1 showed limited but statistically significant overlap between SLI and dyslexia. Study 2 found that children with dyslexia or a combination of dyslexia and SLI performed significantly less well on measures of phonological processing than did children with SLI only and those with typical development. Children with SLI only showed only mild deficits in phonological processing compared with typical children. Conclusions: These results support the view that SLI and dyslexia are distinct but potentially comorbid developmental language disorders. A deficit in phonological processing is closely associated with dyslexia but not with SLI when it occurs in the absence of dyslexia."

Kruk, Jesse Mayer, Leah Funk","We investigated influences of non-alphanumeric rapid naming on decoding skill growth for regularly and irregularly spelled English words. In a longitudinal study, 52 at-risk and 69 not-at-risk readers were tracked from Grade 1 to Grade 3. Non-alphanumeric rapid naming ability measured in Grade 1 accounted for unique variance in irregular word decoding in early Grade 2 – strong rapid naming was associated with strong irregular word decoding. An interaction between reading risk status and Grade 1 rapid naming indicated that the influence of Grade 1 rapid naming ability on growth in irregular word decoding was different for at-risk than not-at-risk readers. Non-alphanumeric rapid naming can have predictive validity as a marker for identifying specific difficulties in learning to read irregular words in at-risk readers. Results indicate that rapid naming plays a general role in irregular word reading and a specific role in at-risk readers' growth in irregular word decoding."

Manis, Kim A. Lindsey, Caroline E. Bailey","Development of English- and Spanish-reading skills was explored in a sample of 251 Spanish-speaking English-language learners from kindergarten through Grade 2. Word identification and reading comprehension developed at a normal rate based on monolingual norms for Spanish- and English-speaking children, but English oral language lagged significantly behind. Four categories of predictor variables were obtained in Spanish in kindergarten and in English in first grade: print knowledge, expressive language (as measured by vocabulary and sentence repetition tasks), phonological awareness, and rapid automatic naming (RAN). Longitudinal regression analyses indicated a modest amount of cross-language transfer from Spanish to English. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that developing English-language skills (particularly phonological awareness and RAN) mediated the contribution of Spanish-language variables to later reading. Further analyses revealed stronger within- than cross-language associations of expressive language with later reading, suggesting that some variables function cross-linguistically, and others within a particular language. Results suggest that some of the cognitive factors underlying reading disabilities in monolingual children (e.g., phonological awareness and RAN) may be important to an understanding of reading difficulties in bilingual children."

Georgiou, Mikko Aro, Chen-Huei Liao, Rauno Parrila","Abstract The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to contrast the prominent theoretical explanations of the rapid automatized naming (RAN)–reading relationship across languages varying in orthographic consistency (Chinese, English, and Finnish) and (b) to examine whether the same accounts can explain the RAN–spelling relationship. In total, 304 Grade 4 children (102 Chinese-speaking Taiwanese children, 117 English-speaking Canadian children, and 85 Finnish-speaking children) were assessed on measures of RAN, speed of processing, phonological processing, orthographic processing, reading fluency, and spelling. The results of path analysis indicated that RAN had a strong direct effect on reading fluency that was of the same size across languages and that only in English was a small proportion of its predictive variance mediated by orthographic processing. In contrast, RAN did not exert a significant direct effect on spelling, and a substantial proportion of its predictive variance was mediated by phonological processing (in Chinese and Finnish) and orthographic processing (in English). Given that RAN predicted reading fluency equally well across languages and that phonological/orthographic processing had very little to do with this relationship, we argue that the reason why RAN is related to reading fluency should be sought in domain-general factors such as serial processing and articulation."

Important features of the study were the inclusion of PAL measures and the fact that the children were followed up to Grade 5. Findings from other orthographies were replicated, in that phonological processing (awareness and memory) and RAN accounted for unique variance in early spelling skills. For later spelling skills, Grade 2 spelling was by far the most powerful predictor. PAL-nonwords was the only measure to explain additional unique variance. It is suggested that PAL-nonwords taps the ability to establish representations of new phonological forms and that this ability is important for the acquisition of orthographic spelling knowledge."

Participants were 119 students from the provinces of Castellon and Valencia, who have been evaluated when 4 years old. The administered instrument was a spanish version of the subtests related to early writing of SHELL scale in which the child has to choose between some letters, the one he needs to write some words (his/her name, “sea”, “sun”, “whistle” and “sun”). Results of the exploratory factor analysis allow to identify two factors which differ in frequency of occurrence and complexity of words and letters that compose them. So, in the ""high exposure"" factor saturate more frequent and simple words and in the ""low exposure"" factor we can find less common words and letters whose learning is delayed because of their complexity component. Furthermore, analysis of the reliability of the test has highlighted a general Cronbach Alpha test of .72 (with oscillations between .56 and .97 in the different items). Therefore, we conclude not only that the scale has a good internal consistency, but also that it is possible to consider the spanish adaptation developed, as a reliable and robust assessment of the writing emergent skills."

Substantial evidence shows that dyslexic readers have problems with rapid naming of visual items. Early research assumed that this was a consequence of phonological processing deficits, but recent findings suggest that non-phonological processes may lie at the root of the association between slow naming speed and poor reading. The hypothesis that rapid naming reflects an independent core deficit in dyslexia is supported by the main findings: (1) some dyslexics are characterized by rapid naming difficulties but intact phonological skills; (2) evidence for an independent association between rapid naming and reading competence in the dyslexic readers, when the effect of phonological skills was controlled; (3) rapid naming and phonological processing measures are not reliably correlated. Recent research also reveals greater predictive power of rapid naming, in particular the inter-item pause time, for high-frequency word reading compared to pseudoword reading in developmental dyslexia. Altogether, the results are more consistent with the view that a phonological component alone cannot account for the rapid naming performance in dyslexia. Rather, rapid naming problems may emerge from the inefficiencies in visual-orthographic processing as well as in phonological processing."

Eleven (11) mothers with tertiary and eleven mothers (11) with secondary education read out loud the book “The three little wolves and the big bad pig” three times, once every three days and the fourth time they narrated it to their 4–5 year olds. All four times, which were recorded by the parents, were done in one-to-one settings, in their homes. Mothers with a tertiary education during the first reading made more extratextual interactions overall, as well as more verbal exchanges in the low-level abstraction categories: organizing the reading, names, clarifying, and in high-level abstraction category relating the story to real life. Mothers with secondary education during the second reading made more extratextual interactions overall, as well as more verbal exchanges in the low-level abstraction categories: clarifying and attention. Both categories of mothers progressively decreased their insertions with subsequent readings. During the first two readings mothers with tertiary education made more extratextual interactions overall, as well as more low- and high-level abstraction insertions, than mothers with secondary education. Children whose mothers had a tertiary education made more insertions overall, including more low- and high-level abstraction extratextual interactions, than the other preschoolers. It was found that all mothers and children had a high percentage of low-level abstraction extratextual interactions.

Nevertheless, mothers with a tertiary education and their children made more high-level abstract extratextual interactions in the category relating the story to real life than the others."

To master a foreign language, words must be recalled and recognized in new and unexpected contexts. The paper describes a research project which investigated how vocabulary can best be learned or taught with 558 primary (6 th grade)  students ( four groups of from sixteen intact classes). Four approaches to vocabulary instruction: (1) Vocal rehearsal + phonological awareness training; (2) Sub-vocal rehearsal + phonological awareness training; (3) Vocal and sub-vocal rehearsal + phonological awareness training; and (4) No rehearsal and phonological awareness training were examined in this study and a comparison was made of their effects on students vocabulary acquisition. Pre-test and post-test vocabulary knowledge scales were administrated and an ANOVA analyses was conduct to identify any significant difference among four groups. The results indicate that all three methods resulted in significant vocabulary gains. Furthermore, the difference between first group, vocal rehearsal phonological awareness training; and second group, sub-vocal rehearsal phonological awareness training, was not significant; participants in the third group did significantly better than those. KEY WORDS: Learning strategies, rehearsal, phonological awareness, foreign language, teaching vocabulary, and English as second language. === About the Author: Dr. Seyed Reza Fallahchai is Assistant Professor of Psychology at the Department of Psychology HU (Hormozgan University), P.O.

Hämäläinen, Minna Torppa, Miia Ronimus","Over two decades of Finnish research, monitoring children born with risk for dyslexia has been carried out in the Jyvaskyla Longitudinal Study of Dyslexia (JLD). Two hundred children, half at risk, have been assessed from birth to puberty on hundreds of measures. The aims were to identify measures of prediction of later reading difficulty and to instigate appropriate and earliest diagnosis and intervention. We can identify at-risk children from newborn electroencephalographic brain recordings (Guttorm et al., J Neural Transm 110:1059–1074, 2003). Predictors are also apparent from late-talking infants who have familial background of dyslexia (Lyytinen and Lyytinen, Appl Psycolinguistics 25:397–411, 2004). The earliest easy-to-use predictive measure to identify children who need help to avoid difficulties in learning to read is letter knowledge (Lyytinen et al., Merrill-Palmer Q 52:514–546, 2006). In response, a purpose-engineered computer game, GraphoGame™, provides an effective intervention tool (Lyytinen et al., Scand J Psychol 50:668–675, 2009). In doubling as a research instrument, GraphoGame provides bespoke intervention/reading instruction for typical/atypically developing children. Used extensively throughout Finland, GraphoGame is now crossing the developed and developing world to assist children, irrespective of the cause (environmental or genetic) of their failing to learn to read (Ojanen et al., Front Psychol 6(671):1–13, 2015)."

One way by which the skills of listening can be developed is through storytelling. Studies have shown however that listening skill is not given adequate attention in primary schools especially, through the use of storytelling. This study therefore investigated the effect of storytelling on the listening skills of primary one pupils. The study adopted pretest-posttest control group quasi experimental design. Two public primary schools were purposively selected and randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group was exposed to storytelling with illustrations while the control group was exposed to storytelling without illustrations. Morrow’s 10-Point Scale for Retelling Analysis was used to measure the listening skills of pupils before and after listening to stories in Yoruba Language. Data collected was analyzed using ANCOVA.

During functional MRI, skilled adult readers of four distinct and highly contrasting languages, Spanish, English, Hebrew, and Chinese, performed an identical semantic categorization task to spoken and written words. Results from three complementary analytic approaches demonstrate limited language variation, with speech–print convergence emerging as a common brain signature of reading proficiency across the wide spectrum of selected languages, whether their writing system is alphabetic or logographic, whether it is opaque or transparent, and regardless of the phonological and morphological structure it represents."

Since learning of literacy has its onset between 3 and 6 years, which is the maximum period of brain plasticity, it is clear the need to relate certain brain functions with the early onset of the skills that are the basis of its learning. Thus, the main objective of this work is the detection of neuropsychological functions that allow proper development of all those skills. Participants were 119 students who have been assessed twice, when 4 and 5 years old. The instruments used were the BIL, the Rapid Automatized Naming and CUMANIN.

Cook, Doctor of Philosophy Utah State University, 2010 Major Professor: Dr. Lori A. Roggman Department: Family, Consumer, and Human Development Reading success has been linked to high school completion, future job success, and future generations of children who can read. Unfortunately, children who are unable to read on grade level by the end of first grade are at a great disadvantage and unlikely to catch up later. Without the ability to read and comprehend text, all aspects of schooling become progressively more difficult and the challenge of poor reading ability can be so difficult to overcome that many poor readers will not complete high school. For these reasons, it is important to identify early experiences in a child’s family environment that predict the early skills that are necessary for later reading and reading comprehension. The child’s family environment includes the quality of both the general home setting and specific kinds of parent-child interactions. The skills necessary for reading success include vocabulary, phonological skills, and other early literacy skills, but broader cognitive and regulatory skills may also be necessary."

A test battery of tasks with a complete crossing of the two phonological awareness facets was given to 364 children aged four, along with a test battery with tasks measuring cognitive abilities ( Gf, Visual, Verbal ). A “correlated trait-correlated method minus one” measurement model fit the data well, and supported the proposed model with two dimensions of phonological awareness. Further analyses demonstrated that the phonological tasks can be subsumed under a dominating general phonological awareness factor and orthogonal narrow factors representing the processing and linguistic complexity factors. A structural equation model in which the linguistic and processing complexity factors were regressed on Gf showed that Gf was highly related to the processing complexity factors but not to the linguistic factors. This suggests that the well-established impact of Gf on reading skills is mediated through phonological awareness. The Verbal factor was related to the linguistic complexity factors when Gf was partialed out but not to the processing complexity factors. The Visual factor did not relate to any of the phonological factors. These results support the view that the Verbal and Visual factors are modality specific, and do not represent general processing capacity."

Carroll, Jonathan Solity, Laura R. Shapiro","Background: It is well established that phonological awareness, print knowledge and rapid naming predict later reading difficulties. However, additional auditory, visual and motor difficulties have also been observed in dyslexic children. It is examined to what extent these difficulties can be used to predict later literacy difficulties. Method: An unselected sample of 267 children at school entry completed a wide battery of tasks associated with dyslexia. Their reading was tested 2, 3 and 4 years later and poor readers were identified (n = 42). Logistic regression and multiple case study approaches were used to examine the predictive validity of different tasks. Results: As expected, print knowledge, verbal short-term memory, phonological awareness and rapid naming were good predictors of later poor reading. Deficits in visual search and in auditory processing were also present in a large minority of the poor readers. Almost all poor readers showed deficits in at least one area at school entry, but there was no single deficit that characterised the majority of poor readers. Conclusions: Results are in line with Pennington’s (2006) multiple deficits view of dyslexia. They indicate that the causes of poor reading outcome are multiple, interacting and probabilistic, rather than deterministic.

These children are at risk for phonological awareness (PA) deficits. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate phonological awareness in Persian-speaking children with phonological disorders. Patients and Methods: Thirty-six children with PD aged 5 - 6 years were selected by a convenience sampling method during 12 months. Children with PD were divided into three groups according to their error patterns. Fourteen normally developing (ND) children were selected as the control group. In order to equalize socioeconomic status, ND children were similar to the PD groups based on age, residential area, and mothers’ educational attainments. Language, speech sound production, oro-motor, and PA skills were investigated. Intra-syllabic and phonological awareness (PA) were compared to investigate PA skills in the four groups. Relation between percent consonant correct (PCC) and PA was also investigated in the four groups. Fourteen children with phonological delay, 12 children with consistent atypical phonological disorders (CAP), and 10 children with inconsistent phonological disorders (ICP) formed the PD groups. Results: The CAP group showed significant difference with the ND group in alliteration (P = 0.001), rhyme (P = 0.001), identification of words with the same initial phoneme (P = 0.002), and identification of words with the same final phoneme (P = 0.001) [except blending phonemes (P = 0.504)]. Though performing more poorly, the delayed group did not show significant difference with ND group (P > 0.05). The ICP and ND groups did not show significant difference in PA except in identifying words with the same final phoneme (P = 0.008). The relation between PCC and PA was observed only in the CAP group (P = 0.021). Conclusions: The results suggested that PA skills in children with phonological disorders are affected by error type. We also found the type of errors that can play a more effective role in PA investigations as compared to PCC. The results also showed that children with CAP require special attention."

This article analyses the access to formal and informal early education of Turkish-origin children in Germany and the influence of these early education contexts on the children's German language acquisition. We use the frequency of stimulating parent–child activities as an indicator of informal education and the attendance in language instruction programmes at preschool as an indicator of formal education. The empirical results show that the frequency of parent–child activities in Turkish-origin families depends on parents’ social background and German language skills. Language instruction programmes in preschools are most frequently used by children who most likely need such programmes: children with low levels of German language skills. For the development of German language skills, parent–child activities seem to be most important."

Objective We used EVALEC (Sprenger-Charolles, Cole, Bechennec, & Kipffer-Piquard, 2005) to collect data on the word-level reading skills and reading-related skills (phonemic awareness, phonological short-term memory, and rapid naming) of middle school children (Grades 6 to 9, about 80 in each grade). Method In the tests focused on word-level reading skills, the effects of regularity (regular vs. irregular words), lexicality, and length (short vs. long irregular words and pseudowords) were examined. Accuracy and processing times were recorded for all tests. Results The effects of both regularity and lexicality were significant, whatever the measure and independently of grade. Both accuracy and speed were lower for longer pseudowords, whereas length did not have a significant effect on irregular word latencies and, surprisingly, long irregular words were read more accurately than short ones. Reading level as assessed by a standardized test (Lefavrais, 2005) was not predicted by phonological short-term memory; rapid naming (color names) and phonemic awareness were both predictors but, in both cases, only response times predicted reading level. Conclusion These results, and particularly those from the reading tasks, are discussed in relation to models of written-word recognition developed to account for the reading of multisyllabic items (Perry, Ziegler, & Zorzi, 2010) in orthographies shallower than English (Perry, Ziegler, & Zorzi, 2014)."

METHODS: we analyzed early reading skills in 73 children aged between six and eight years, from a public school in Sao Paulo. The instrument used for assessing the children's early reading skills comprised of 20 subtests involving the following skills: ""Oral language""; ""Phonological processing""; ""Comprehension""; ""Reading and writing""; and ""Print awareness"". Data were collected and analyzed by school year (1st and 2nd grades) in order to identify differences in development at the early stages of Reading acquisition. RESULTS: it was found that the performance of some 1st- and 2nd-graders was less than average when compared to the remainder of their group on the skills considered as predictors of literacy. This low performance was identified from the percentage of total correct responses in the assessment Instrument and the classification into percentiles. There were no differences between the two grades in terms of ""Oral Language"" and ""Print awareness"". What differentiated one group from the other was their outcome at ""Reading and writing"" and ""Phonological processing"" tasks, with 2nd-grade students performing better on the following tasks: (a) word reading; (b) pseudoword reading; (c) word spelling; (d) pseudoword spelling; (e) rhyme production; and (f) reading comprehension. CONCLUSION: schooling influenced the performance on phonological processing abilities, and on reading and writing skills. Phonological processing abilities and print awareness correlated with the decoding involved in the writing and reading of isolated items."

The main objective of the present study was to obtain insight in the relationship between alphanumeric vs. non-alphanumeric RAN and reading/spelling and mathematics in groups of 7-to-10-year-old children with RSD, MD, both RSD + MD, and in typically developing (TD) children. Analyses of variance between the groups showed that the RSD and comorbid (RSD + MD) groups were impaired on both alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric RAN, whereas the MD group was impaired only on non-alphanumeric RAN. Furthermore, non-alphanumeric RAN correlated with all measures except spelling, whereas alphanumeric RAN correlated with the reading and spelling measures only. These findings point towards different/additional cognitive processes needed in non-alphanumeric RAN compared to alphanumeric RAN, which affects the relationship with literacy and math."

Pandey, Arun Pande, Sunil Kumar Kopparapu","Patients with articulatory disorders often have difficulty in speaking. These patients need several speech therapy sessions to enable them speak normally. These therapy sessions are conducted by a specialized speech therapist. The goal of speech therapy is to develop good speech habits as well as to teach how to articulate sounds the right way. Speech therapy is critical for continuous improvement to regain normal speech. Speech therapy sessions require a patient to travel to a hospital or a speech therapy center for extended periods of time regularly; this makes the process of speech therapy not only time consuming but also very expensive. Additionally, there is a severe shortage of trained speech therapists around the globe in general and in developing countries in particular. In this paper, we propose a low cost mobile speech therapist, a system that enables speech therapy using a mobile phone which eliminates the need of the patient to frequently travel to a speech therapist in a far away hospital. The proposed system, which is being built, enables both synchronous and asynchronous interaction between the speech therapist and the patient anytime anywhere"

The authors aimed to assess the predictive power of textual narrative competence on early narrative text writing skills taking into account the impact of spelling ability. Eighty children (M age = 5.3 years, age range = 4.9–5.7 years; SD = 0.29) were followed longitudinally until entering the first grade of primary school. During kindergarten, they were tested with an oral story production task and in first grade with a written story production task. Narratives were evaluated in terms of structure, cohesion and consistency. In the first grade, children were also submitted to a dictation task to evaluate their spelling competence. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed in order to examine narrative competence development, also considering gender differences, and regression analyses were implemented to evaluate the predictive capability of textual abilities expressed by oral narratives on textual abilities expressed by writing. The results showed some significant differences when scores in kindergarten were compared to scores in primary school. Moreover, the ability to tell well-structured, cohesive and consistent stories predicts the ability to write stories with the same qualities in the sample of participants without spelling difficulty. Instead, the predictive link is not apparent considering those children with difficulties in orthographic ability. This research allows us to reflect about how the medium of writing might interfere, on the basis of the level of mastery, with the opportunity to express narrative skills in the transition from the oral to written code. The central role of writing instrument functionality opens the way to practical implications."

In particular, children's active participation is considered key. This study investigated links between maternal beliefs about shared reading strategies and children's readiness to learn to read, mothers' observed shared reading behaviors, and children's vocabulary sizes. Participants were 62 mothers and their preschool children attending Head Start. Mother–child book reading was observed, and mothers' beliefs were measured via self-report and ratings of videotaped vignettes portraying reading strategies. Children's expressive and receptive vocabularies were assessed. Results revealed that dyadic shared reading quality mediated the link between mothers' beliefs and children's expressive, but not receptive, vocabulary. Further, mothers' perceptions of children's readiness to learn to read moderated the link between mother's beliefs and shared reading quality. This evidence highlights the importance of maternal beliefs in guiding behaviors that facilitate preschoolers' vocabulary development."

Este marco ha habilitado la posibilidad de realizar una identificacion temprana de las dificultades especificas de aprendizaje de la lectura y ha justificado su necesidad practica. Cuatro son las aportaciones fundamentales. Primero, la teoria fonologica defiende que la dislexia evolutiva se produce como consecuencia de un deficit fonologico general que afecta a diversos componentes del sistema fonologico, entre los que destacan la conciencia fonologica, la velocidad de los procesos lexicos y la memoria verbal a corto plazo. Segundo, la teoria fonologica ha puesto de manifiesto que la causa primaria de la dislexia esta presente desde el periodo embrionario y produce consecuencias sobre el desarrollo del lenguaje oral durante todo el periodo previo al aprendizaje de la lectura. Tercero, la teoria fonologica ha defendido la tesis del lenguaje oral como causa primaria del deficit, y con ello ha revelado las relaciones entre los trastornos especificos del lenguaje y la dislexia evolutiva. Cuarto, la investigacion ha mostrado el significativo impacto de los programas de prevencion e intervencion temprana, lo que obliga a complementar las estrategias reactivas y tardias de diagnostico, con estrategias proactivas de prevencion y/o identificacion e intervencion temprana. Finalmente, se argumenta que si las causas primeras y los sistemas de prevencion e intervencion de estas dificultades estan directamente vinculados con el desarrollo del lenguaje, entonces la logopedia deberia tener un papel protagonista en la implementacion de las estrategias proactivas en el contexto escolar."

Findings demonstrated that preschool children's math self-concept can be separated into competence and affect components, with the competence component displaying higher relations to early math achievement than the affect component. The competence component but not the affect component was found to be related to prior math achievement, providing evidence of the skill-development model of self-concept–achievement relations in preschool years. Boys and girls demonstrated similar self-concept–achievement relations and mean levels in the competence and affect components of math self-concept. Given so far little research on self-concept in preschool children, this study offers important insights and expands current knowledge."

It appears that all these skills constitute relevant factors that should be taken into account in order to understand typical as well as atypical literacy development."

Pugh, Katarzyna Jednoróg","Abstract Phonological processing ability is a key factor in reading acquisition, predicting its later success or causing reading problems when it is weakened. Our aim here was to establish the neural correlates of auditory word rhyming (a standard phonological measure) in 102 young children with (FHD +) and without familial history of dyslexia (FHD −) in a shallow orthography (i.e. Polish). Secondly, in order to gain a deeper understanding on how schooling shapes brain activity to phonological awareness, a comparison was made of children who had had formal literacy instruction for several months (in first grade) and those who had not yet had any formal instruction in literacy (in kindergarten). FHD + children compared to FHD − children in the first grade scored lower in an early print task and showed longer reaction times in the in-scanner rhyme task. No behavioral differences between FHD + and FHD − were found in the kindergarten group. On the neuronal level, overall familial risk was associated with reduced activation in the bilateral temporal, tempo-parietal and inferior temporal–occipital regions, as well as the bilateral inferior and middle frontal gyri. Subcortically, hypoactivation was found in the bilateral thalami, caudate, and right putamen in FHD +. A main effect of the children's grade was present only in the left inferior frontal gyrus, where reduced activation for rhyming was shown in first-graders. Several regions in the ventral occipital cortex, including the fusiform gyrus, and in the right middle frontal and postcentral gyri, displayed an interaction between familial risk and grade. The present results show strong influence of familial risk that may actually increase with formal literacy instruction."

Two subskills, phonological recoding and orthographic knowledge, were measured. Results revealed that individuals with DS performed similarly to controls on 2 measures of orthographic knowledge, but more poorly on phonological recoding and a third measure of orthographic knowledge. The first two orthographic tasks included real words as stimuli; the third task used letter patterns, not real words. These results suggest that individuals with DS may have a relative strength in word-specific orthographic knowledge but not in general orthographic knowledge."

The children (N = 72) performed five phonological tasks and a vocabulary test, a letter knowledge test and a reading skills test twice; in the beginning, when knowing no letters, and at the end of the study. The results show that the children's performance in the different phonological tasks improved over a six-month period. Detecting word structure or blending phonemes were easier than producing rhymes or twisting. The children who had learned to recognize letters performed better in phonological tasks than the children who had not learned any letters, but children able to read precociously exceeded all. Our results appear to indicate that learning letters does not require previous PA ability but affects PA."

Children were retested in grades one and four. Results showed that although the prognostic validity of kindergarten measures was generally low, it was considerably higher for grade one children in classes with non-systematic phonics instruction. Children who received systematic phonics instruction scored significantly higher on measures of phonological decoding as compared to their peers who received less systematic instruction.

In particular, the study focuses on lexical stress, and on the awareness of lexical stress measured by the ability to detect the loudest syllable in a pseudoword. The hypothesis is that stress awareness may play a role in the acquisition of word reading in Spanish. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 233 children from 3rd to 6th grades. Cognitive and phonemic awareness skills were tested. A lexical stress awareness task and a reading aloud task were also used. Results highlight the relevance of prosodic knowledge in learning how to read the Spanish written words. In all grades, lexical stress awareness appears to be related to stress reading errors. On the contrary, phonemic awareness is not related to stress errors, except in 4th grade. These data are discussed considering that, apart from phonological awareness, prosodic (lexical stress) awareness would also be relevant in reading acquisition."

Our approach was to isolate components of saccadic planning, articulation, and lexical retrieval in 3 modified RAN tasks. We analyzed 2 samples of undergraduate readers (ages 17–27). We evaluated the incremental contributions of these components and found that saccadic planning to nonlinguistic stimuli alone explained roughly one third of the variance that conventional RAN tasks explained in eye movements registered during text reading for comprehension. We conclude that the well-established predictive role of RAN for reading performance is in part due to the individual ability to coordinate rapid sequential eye movements to visual nonlinguistic stimuli."

L1 and L2 competencies were assessed at four time points (pretest and three posttests). No detrimental effects of immersion on L1 development were found. Concerning L2 receptive skills, the immersion group outperformed the conventional instruction group in each posttest. Contact quality and quantity were found to relate to L2 acquisition through immersion.

Dyslexia is associated with structural and functional alterations in various brain regions that support reading. Neuroimaging studies in infants and pre-reading children suggest that these alterations predate reading instruction and reading failure, supporting the hypothesis that variant function in dyslexia susceptibility genes lead to atypical neural migration and/or axonal growth during early, most likely in utero, brain development. Yet, dyslexia is typically not diagnosed until a child has failed to learn to read as expected (usually in second grade or later). There is emerging evidence that neuroimaging measures, when combined with key behavioral measures, can enhance the accuracy of identification of dyslexia risk in pre-reading children but its sensitivity, specificity, and cost-efficiency is still unclear. Early identification of dyslexia risk carries important implications for dyslexia remediation and the amelioration of the psychosocial consequences commonly associated with reading failure.

Method Thirty-eight children with DD and 25 TD children participated in a visual-auditory oddball paradigm. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by standard and deviant stimuli in an early (100–190ms) and late (560–750ms) time window were analysed. Results In the early time window, ERPs elicited by the deviant stimulus were delayed and less left lateralized over fronto-temporal electrodes for children with DD compared to TD children. In the late time window, children with DD showed higher amplitudes extending more over right frontal electrodes. Longer latencies in the early time window and stronger right hemispheric activation in the late time window were associated with slower reading and naming speed. Additionally, stronger right hemispheric activation in the late time window correlated with poorer phonological awareness skills. Conclusions Deficits in early stages of letter-sound processing influence later more explicit cognitive processes during letter-sound processing. Significance Identifying the neurophysiological correlates of letter-sound processing and their relation to reading related skills provides insight into the degree of automaticity during letter-sound processing beyond behavioural measures of letter-sound-knowledge."

In this article, I study the impact of an intensive in-service teacher training program on reading skills offered to kindergarten teachers in France. The program modifies the lesson content and encourages teachers to adapt instruction to student needs by dividing the class according to initial achievement. While assessing impact is usually difficult due to the presence of ability bias and teacher selection, I show that in this context, a value-added model that controls for school and teacher characteristics constitutes a legitimate strategy to estimate the treatment effect. Results show that all students benefiting from the program progressed in reading skills at the end of the year. Besides, weaker students progressed faster on less-advanced competences (such as letter recognition), while stronger students improved their reading skills. This suggests that teachers adjusted content to students’ needs. Finally, a cost-effectiveness analysis reveals that the program is approximately three times more cost-effective than reducing class size in France."

Aim: to determine the possible gain in performance in tasks involving phonemic awareness skills in boys and girls, following the development of a program to stimulate phonemic awareness. Method: participants were 18 boys and 18 girls, all with typical language development, in their second grade of Elementary Education. The study involved three steps. The first and third steps consisted of an auditory screening, speech and language assessments and the assessment of phonemic awareness skills, through the Phonological Awareness Tasks Protocol. The second step involved the planning of the phonological awaress stimulation program and its application in the classroom. Results: boys and girls presented an improvement in their performance in all of the phonological awareness tasks after the application of the stimulation program; this improvement was statistically significant. Regarding the influence of gender, it was observed that prior to the application of the stimulation program, there was a significant difference between boys and girls in the task involving the detection of a phoneme in the last position. After stimulation, this difference remained significant in the same task, and was also statistically significant for the tasks of phonemic segmentation of words with six phonemes and phoneme reversion of words with two or three phonemes. Conclusion: it is observed that girls performed better in the majority of the phonemic awareness tasks, and that the program was effective in stimulating these tasks."

Jansma, Leo Blomert, Anniek Vaessen","Abstract The evident degree of heterogeneity observed in reading disabled children has puzzled reading researchers for decades. Recent advances in the genetic underpinnings of reading disability have indicated that the heritable, familial risk for dyslexia is a major risk factor. The present data-driven, classification attempt aims to revisit the possibility of identifying distinct cognitive deficit profiles in a large sample of second to fourth grade reading disabled children. In this sample, we investigated whether genetic and environmental risk factors are able to distinguish between poor reader subtypes. In this profile, we included reading-related measures of phonemic awareness, letter-speech sound processing and rapid naming, known as candidate vulnerability markers associated with dyslexia and familial risk for dyslexia, as well as general cognitive abilities (non-verbal IQ and vocabulary). Clustering was based on a 200 multi-start K -means approach. Results revealed four emerging subtypes of which the first subtype showed no cognitive deficits underlying their poor reading skills ( Reading-only impaired poor readers ). The other three subtypes shared a core phonological deficit (PA) with a variable and discriminative expression across the other underlying vulnerability markers. More specific, type 2 showed low to poor performance across all reading-related and general cognitive abilities ( general poor readers ), type 3 showed a specific letter-speech sound mapping deficit next to a PA deficit ( PA-LS specific poor readers ) and type 4 showed a specific rapid naming deficit complementing their phonological weakness ( PA-RAN specific poor readers ). The first three poor reader profiles were more characterized by variable environmental risk factor, while the fourth, PA-RAN poor reader subtype showed a significantly strong familial risk for dyslexia. Overall, when we zoom in on the heterogeneous phenomenon of reading disability, unique and distinct cognitive subtypes can be identified, distinguishing between those poor readers more influences by the role of genes and those more influenced by environmental risk factors. Taking into account this diversity of distinct cognitive subtypes, instead of looking at the reading disabled sample as a whole, will help tailor future diagnostic and intervention efforts more specifically to the needs of children with such a specific deficit and risk pattern, as well as providing a more promising way forward for genetic studies of dyslexia."

But letter learning represents a considerable challenge for many children growing in poverty contexts, as evidenced by studies con duct ed with both selected and unselected samples of different ages (Diuk, Serrano & Ferroni, 2013; Duncan & Seymour, 2000). Even though letter knowledge has been largely attributed to expe riential factors such as learning opportunities provided by a child’s home or school, there is growing evidence that individual differences in several cognitive and linguistic variables are related to the ease with which children learn letter names or sounds."

Even though overwhelming research literature on the subject is available, the majority of this existing work is designed and organized in western contexts i.e. developed countries. Due to that reason, much less is known about the effects of tutorial instructional programmes and educational games on the literacy skills of Arabic speaking kindergarten children. Our study tries to bridge this gap in the existing literature by performing a comparison study of two different instructional programmes on the development of literacy skills amongst 5 to 6 years old kindergarten children in Saudi Arabia. As a result of this study, it was found that educational games were more effective in supporting and facilitating literacy skills of participating kindergarten children compared to tutorial instructional programmes."

Sayeski, Gentry A. Earle, R. Paige Eslinger, Jessy N. Whitenton","Matching phonemes (speech sounds) to graphemes (letters and letter combinations) is an important aspect of decoding (translating print to speech) and encoding (translating speech to print). Yet, many teacher candidates do not receive explicit training in phoneme-grapheme correspondence. Difficulty with accurate phoneme production and/or lack of understanding of sound-symbol correspondence can make it challenging for teachers to (a) identify student errors on common assessments and (b) serve as a model for students when teaching beginning reading or providing remedial reading instruction. For students with dyslexia, lack of teacher proficiency in this area is particularly problematic. This study examined differences between two learning conditions (massed and distributed practice) on teacher candidates’ development of phoneme-grapheme correspondence knowledge and skills. An experimental, pretest-posttest-delayed test design was employed with teacher candidates (n = 52) to compare a massed practice condition (one, 60-min session) to a distributed practice condition (four, 15-min sessions distributed over 4 weeks) for learning phonemes associated with letters and letter combinations. Participants in the distributed practice condition significantly outperformed participants in the massed practice condition on their ability to correctly produce phonemes associated with different letters and letter combinations. Implications for teacher preparation are discussed."

Some authors maintain that, given the transparency of the reading system, non-lexical reading is the strategy followed predominantly by Spanish readers and for that reason these models are not appropriate to explain alexias (acquired dyslexias) in Spanish. Other authors, consider that since several cases of phonological, surface and deep alexia have been reported, dual-route reading models are applicable to Spanish in the same way that to the irregular writing systems. In order to contrast these two points of view, an analysis of the two main factors that influence the reading is made: characteristics of the Spanish orthography and characteristics of the Spanish readers. It is conclude that, (1) Due to its transparency, non-lexical reading represents -as in other transparent orthographies- the initial reading strategy in Spanish; (2) the ""reading threshold"" (i.e., time required to become literate) is lower in Spanish because there are no irregular words to learn; (3) as reading experience increases, speed increases and lexical reading becomes used more; (4) Given the characteristics of the Spanish reading system, it is understandable that frequency of deep dyslexia is so low."

Children with dyslexia produced fewer clitics than their age controls and vocabulary controls. Ten children with dyslexia scored less than 1.5 SD below the mean score of an additional group of 89 children of the same age, selected across a range of oral and reading abilities. No difference was found in quantifier comprehension. These findings suggest that a large number of children with dyslexia are likely to be affected by SLI, although not diagnosed, and the authors recommend language assessment, including assessment of clitic production, when children are referred for dyslexia.

According to this view, reading ability is considered to follow a bimodal distribution, with dyslexia as the lower mode. We hypothesized that, instead, reading ability follows a normal distribution, with dyslexia at the lower end of the continuum. Methods and Results We used data from the Connecticut Longitudinal Study, a sample survey of 414 Connecticut children who entered kindergarten in 1983 and were followed as a longitudinal cohort. Dyslexia was defined in terms of a discrepancy score, which represents the difference between actual reading achievement and achievement predicted on the basis of measures of intelligence. Data were available from intelligence tests administered in grades 1, 3, and 5 and achievement tests administered yearly in grades 1 through 6. For each child there were 108 possible discrepancy scores ([3 × 3 years] × [2 × 6 years]) based..."

Snowling, Monica Melby-Lervåg","This article reviews 95 publications (based on 21 independent samples) that have examined children at family risk of reading disorders. We report that children at family risk of dyslexia experience delayed language development as infants and toddlers. In the preschool period, they have significant difficulties in phonological processes as well as with broader language skills and in acquiring the foundations of decoding skill (letter knowledge, phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming [RAN]). Findings are mixed with regard to auditory and visual perception: they do not appear subject to slow motor development, but lack of control for comorbidities confounds interpretation. Longitudinal studies of outcomes show that children at family risk who go on to fulfil criteria for dyslexia have more severe impairments in preschool language than those who are defined as normal readers, but the latter group do less well than controls. Similarly at school age, family risk of dyslexia is associated with significantly poor phonological awareness and literacy skills. Although there is no strong evidence that children at family risk are brought up in an environment that differs significantly from that of controls, their parents tend to have lower educational levels and read less frequently to themselves. Together, the findings suggest that a phonological processing deficit can be conceptualized as an endophenotype of dyslexia that increases the continuous risk of reading difficulties; in turn its impact may be moderated by protective factors."

In the second part of the study, we analyzed the difference in the reading ability between fourteen children who participated in the intervention program and eighteen non-participating children. Reading ability was assessed by evaluating word recognition, oral reading fluency, reading comprehension, and pseudo-word recognition. The reading ability of intervention group improved more compared to control group, and the difference between two groups accentuated over time. However, final analysis conducted in November revealed that two groups did not differ significantly in oral reading fluency. This suggests that, unlike word recognition and comprehension, fluency might not dramatically improve in a short period."

Lowenstein, Christopher Holloman","Abstract Purpose Newborn hearing screening has made it possible to provide early treatment of hearing loss to more children than ever before, raising expectations these children will be able to attend regular schools. But continuing deficits in spoken language skills have led to challenges in meeting those expectations. This study was conducted to (1) examine two kinds of language skills (phonological and morphosyntactic) at school age (second grade) for children with cochlear implants (CIs); (2) see which measures from earlier in life best predicted performance at second grade; (3) explore how well these skills supported other cognitive and language functions; and (4) examine how treatment factors affected measured outcomes. Methods Data were analyzed from 100 second-grade, monolingual English-speaking children: 51 with CIs and 49 with normal hearing (NH). Ten measures of spoken language and related functions were collected: three each of phonological and morphosyntactic skills; and four of other cognitive and language functions. Six measures from preschool and seven from kindergarten served as predictor variables. The effects of treatment variables were examined. Results Children with CIs were more delayed acquiring phonological than morphosyntactic skills. Mean length of utterance at earlier ages was the most consistent predictor of both phonological and morphosyntactic skills at second grade. Early bimodal stimulation had a weak, but positive effect on phonological skills at second grade; sign language experience during preschool had a negative effect on morphosyntactic structures in spoken language.

The study included 105 children (54 girls) from 12 preschools in Norway. The preschools were randomly assigned to the experimental group with the invented writing program, or the control group with the ordinary program offered to preschoolers. The classroom-based programs (40 sessions) were conducted by the children’s regular teachers. The children’s emergent literacy skills were evaluated using a pre-test, a post-test and a follow-up test 6 months later, and the data were analyzed using latent autoregressive models. The results showed that the invented writing group performed significantly better than the control group on the post-test for the measures of phoneme awareness (d = .54), spelling (d = .65) and word reading (d = .36). Additionally, indirect effects were observed on the delayed follow-up tests on phoneme awareness (d = .45), spelling (d = .48) and word reading (d = .26). In conclusion, we argue that invented writing appeared to smooth the progress of emergent literacy skills in preschool, including the subsequent reading development in school. Contextualized in a semi-consistent orthography and a preschool tradition that does not encourage the learning of written language skills, the findings add to our knowledge of how children learn to write and read."

Few investigations have examined the relationship between a comprehensive range of executive functioning (EF) abilities and reading. 

Aims. 
Our investigation identified components of EF that independently predicted single word reading, and determined whether their predictive role remained when additional variables were included in the regression analyses. This provided information about the EF processes that are related to reading, and the unity and diversity of EF. 

Sample.
This consisted of 160 children: 88 were typically developing with no language difficulties; 72 had language impairments. 

Method.
The assessments involved decoding, ten measures of EF, reaction time, naming speed, non-verbal and verbal age-equivalent scores.

Results and conclusions.
In the first regression analysis, which only concerned the EF variables, the following verbal forms of EF had significant relationships with decoding: working memory; fluency; planning; and inhibition. Further regression analyses included additional predictor variables: reaction time; naming speed, and age-equivalent scores. These analyses indicated that most of the EF variables continued to predict decoding even when entered with competitor variables. Furthermore, after the entry of executive functioning variables there were no group differences in decoding (typical versus language difficulties). We discuss the contribution of EF and other variables to reading abilities."

However, while several studies have examined the relationship between language delay and reading impairment, relatively few have focused on spelling. In this study, spelling performance of 28 children with developmental dyslexia (DD), 14 children with a history of language delay (LD) and 14 children without (NoLD) and 28 control participants were examined. Spelling was investigated by writing a dictation task that included orthographically regular stimuli (word and nonwords), as well as words with unpredictable transcription. Results indicated that all dyslexic participants underperformed compared to controls on both regular and unpredictable transcription stimuli, but LD performance was generally the worst. Moreover, spelling impairment assumed different characteristics in LD and NoLD children. LD children were more sensitive to acoustic-to-phonological variables, showing relevant failure especially on stimuli containing geminate consonants but also on polysyllabic stimuli and those containing non-continuant consonants. Error analysis confirmed these results, with LD children producing a higher rate of phonological errors respect to NoLD children and controls. Results were coherent with the hypothesis that among dyslexic children, those with previous language delay have more severe spelling deficit, suffering from defective orthographic lexical acquisition together with long-lasting phonological difficulties."

It addresses three main issues: the position of phonemic segmentation skill in literature, the relation between phonological awareness and ability to read, and the skill of word recognition and learning to read. The aim of this paper is to precisely explore the nature of the relation of phonemic segmentation skill and beginning readers’ word recognition. The leading research question for this paper is: What is the relationship between the skill of phonemic segmentation and beginning readers’ EFL word recognition? To answer the research question, the researcher will review literature to explore that relation. The researcher will conclude that the relationship between the skill of phonemic segmentation and word recognition has received substantial concern in literature. It has significant effects on learning to read as well. Calls for implications, recommendations and intervention programs will be presented accordingly."

Snowling","Children with preschool language difficulties are at high risk of literacy problems; however, the nature of the relationship between delayed language development and dyslexia is not understood. Three hundred eight Slovak and Czech children were recruited into three groups: family risk of dyslexia, speech/language difficulties and controls, and were assessed three times from kindergarten until Grade 1. There was a twofold increase in probability of reading problems in each risk group. Precursors of ‘dyslexia’ included difficulties in oral language and code-related skills (phoneme awareness, letter-knowledge and rapid automatized naming); poor performance in phonological memory and vocabulary was observed in both affected and unaffected high-risk peers. A two-group latent variable path model shows that early language skills predict code-related skills, which in turn predict literacy skills. Findings suggest that dyslexia in Slavic languages has its origins in early language deficits, and children who succumb to reading problems show impaired code-related skills before the onset of formal reading instruction.

Snowling, Silke Fricke","Background: While practitioners are increasingly asked to be mindful of the evidence-base
of intervention programmes, evidence from rigorous trials for the effectiveness of
interventions that promote oral language abilities in the early years is sparse. 

Aims: This study evaluates the effectiveness of a language intervention programme for
children identified as having poor oral language skills in preschool classes. 

Methods & Procedures: A randomised controlled trial was carried out in 13 UK nursery
schools. In each nursery, eight children (N = 104, mean age = 3 years 11 months) with the
poorest performance on standardised language measures were selected to take part. All but
one child was randomly allocated to either an intervention (N = 52) or a waiting control
group (N = 51). The intervention group received a 15-week oral language programme in
addition to their standard nursery curriculum. The programme was delivered by trained
teaching assistants and aimed to foster vocabulary knowledge, narrative and listening skills. 

Outcomes & Results: Initial results revealed significant differences between the intervention
and control group on measures of taught vocabulary. No group differences were found on
any standardised language measure; however there were gains of moderate effect size in
listening comprehension. 

Conclusions & Implications: The study suggests that an intervention, of moderate duration
and intensity, for small groups of preschool children successfully builds vocabulary
knowledge, but does not generalize to non-taught areas of language. The findings strike a
note of caution about implementing language interventions of moderate duration in
preschool settings. The findings also highlight the importance of including a control group in
intervention studies."

The 12 years between these two kindergarten cohorts were characterized by a heightened understanding of the importance of early childhood in the life course and relatedly, substantial increases in public preschool access. Across both cohorts, preschool participation is positively associated with cognitive outcomes at school entry, and although these associations are substantially smaller, they are still present at the end of first grade. We document negative associations between preschool participation and behavioral outcomes. Notably however, these relationships are far less pronounced for the recent cohort. Finally, across both kindergarten cohorts, we document a particularly large positive association between preschool participation and first grade cognitive outcomes for black children.

Evidence is presented for quadrant models that explain language disorders and dyslexia along two dimensions—sound/word level (phonological) knowledge and sentence/discourse level (non-phonological) knowledge. Support for these two dimensions comes from factor analysis of a new assessment tool called the Test of Integrated Language and Literacy Skills (TILLS).

Also, the correlation between the performances of phonemic awareness sub-tasks in two presentation conditions were examined. As a result, 6-year-old group showed significantly higher phonemic awareness scores than 5-year-old group. Both group showed significantly higher scores in visual presentation than auditory presentation. While the performance under the visual presentation was significantly lower especially in the segmentation than the other two tasks, there was no significant difference among sub-tasks under the auditory presentation. 5-year-old group showed significantly more `no response` errors than 6-year-old group and 6-year-old group showed significantly more `phoneme substitution` and `phoneme omission` errors than 5-year-old group.

Two experiments were conducted for this purpose. In Experiment 1, normal readers (N = 108) and dyslexics (23) were given a set of literacy tasks, visual attention, and rapid automatized naming. The results indicated that dyslexic children exhibited lower reading-related skills than controls. Visual attention and phonological processing were able to predict word reading. Experiment 2 was carried out on 36 dyslexic children compared to chronological-age controls. This experiment was designed to assess the relation between phonological awareness and working memory with word recognition and reading comprehension. Results showed significant differences between groups in literacy scores. In addition, inter-correlations indicated a strong relation between word recognition and reading comprehension on one hand and phonological awareness and verbal working memory on the other. Regression analyses showed that rapid naming, visual attention, and verbal working memory were significantly associated with literacy. The findings underscored the importance of cognitive skills in the acquisition of Arabic literacy and emphasized persistent difficulties in dyslexic children from multiple causes."

Results showed that the intervention had a significant positive effect on children's literacy skills from baseline to the end of summer before the start of kindergarten ( d  = .14). The intervention also had significant indirect effects on teacher ratings of children's literacy skills during the fall of their kindergarten year (β = .09). Additionally, when scores were compared to standard benchmarks, a greater percentage of the children who received the intervention moved from being at risk for reading difficulties to having low risk. Overall, this study demonstrates that a school readiness intervention delivered prior to the start of kindergarten may help increase children's early literacy skills."

In Brazil, at this moment, there are no studies regarding the internal structure for tests of phonological awareness. This article shows the factorial validity of a test of phonological awareness composed by three sub- tests: two tasks of subtraction of initial phoneme and one of phonemic segmentation. The multidimensional confirmatory factorial analysis was applied to a sample of 176 Brazilian students (M age = 9.3 years) from the first to fifth grade of elementary school. Results indicated a well-adjusted model, with items of intermediate difficulty and high factor loadings; thus, this corroborated the internal structure and well-designed theoretical conception."

These profiles were compared retrospectively on a range of measures administered 2 years earlier, in kindergarten. These measures were based on factors known to be predictors of either decoding skills or comprehension performance. The results showed that children experiencing comprehension difficulties in second grade have early deficits in vocabulary, inferencing, working memory and morphology, while the children with decoding difficulties have limited letter knowledge and rapid naming performance. Phonological skills and verbal short-term memory appeared to be deficient in all three profiles of struggling readers. These results are discussed in terms of the early identification of at-risk children in kindergarten and the remedial programmes that could be provided to them at an early stage.



Highlights 

What is already known about this topic?

Reading implies two main components: reading and comprehension.
Each component of reading is underpinned by different predictors.
Different profiles of struggling readers with specific deficit to one component could be identified.


What this paper adds?

Profiles of struggling readers are characterised by different deficits in linguistic and cognitive skills.
These deficits are observed early on, before the formal instruction of learning to read.


Implications for practice and/or policy:

Different remediation programmes should be administered to different types of struggling readers.
These programmes should foster the deficits characterising each profile.
These programmes could be proposed early on to prevent future difficulties in reading."

Georgiou, Pekka Niemi, Marja-Kristiina Lerkkanen, Anna-Maija Poikkeus","Research and clinical practitioners have mixed views whether reading and spelling difficulties should be combined or seen as separate. This study examined the following: (a) if double dissociation between reading and spelling can be identified in a transparent orthography (Finnish) and (b) the cognitive and noncognitive precursors of this phenomenon. Finnish-speaking children (n = 1963) were assessed on reading fluency and spelling in grades 1, 2, 3, and 4. Dissociation groups in reading and spelling were formed based on stable difficulties in grades 1–4. The groups were compared in kindergarten phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, letter knowledge, home literacy environment, and task-avoidant behavior. The results indicated that the double dissociation groups could be identified even in the context of a highly transparent orthography: 41 children were unexpected poor spellers (SD), 36 were unexpected poor readers (RD), and 59 were poor in both reading and spelling (RSD). The RSD group performed poorest on all cognitive skills and showed the most task-avoidant behavior, the RD group performed poorly particularly on rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge, and the SD group had difficulties on phonological awareness and letter knowledge. Fathers’ shared book reading was less frequent in the RD and RSD groups than in the other groups. The findings suggest that there are discernible double dissociation groups with distinct cognitive profiles. This further suggests that the identification of difficulties in Finnish and the planning of teaching and remediation practices should include both reading and spelling assessments."

Participants were 116 Spanish-speaking children aged six years and without special educational needs, all of whom were attending schools in a medium socioeconomic area. Descriptive/exploratory and bivariate analyses were performed with the data derived from three measures of reading ability (accuracy, speed, and efficiency), and hierarchical multivariate regression models were constructed. In general, the results confirm that, with the exception of non-alphanumeric rapid naming, the cognitive variables studied are predictors of reading performance for words and pseudowords, although their influence differs depending on the reading measures and type of linguistic unit considered . Phonemic awareness, phonological memory, and alphanumeric rapid naming were the best predictors of reading accuracy for words and pseudowords. Variability in the other two measures of reading ability (speed and efficiency) was best explained by alphanumeric rapid naming. These results suggest that reading is a complex skill that depends on different types of cognitive variables according to the age and/or level of the reader, the type of orthography and the type of measure used. Furthermore, they highlight the need to provide instruction in these processes from an early age so as to address or prevent the problems that children may present."

Nonverbal IQ was included as a control variable. The results showed that phonological awareness, letter knowledge and English vocabulary at T1 all predicted English word reading (T3) through spelling (T2). Further mediation analyses showed that, for phonological awareness and English vocabulary, full mediation effects were found. For letter knowledge, a partial mediation effect was observed. These results suggest that, in Chinese ESL kindergarteners, reading-related predictors foster word reading via spelling, a process that intersects phonology, orthography and semantics. Practical implications of these findings were also discussed."

Their cognitive skills were assessed in kindergarten, listening comprehension and reading fluency in Grades 1 and 2, and reading comprehension in Grades 1–3. Reading fluency and listening comprehension accounted for 37% of the variance in reading comprehension in Grade 2 and 28% in Grade 3. The direct effect of reading fluency on reading comprehension disappeared after Grade 1, whereas the effect of listening comprehension remained significant across time. Cognitive skills predicted reading comprehension mainly indirectly via listening comprehension and reading fluency in Grade 1. These findings support the validity of the SVR model in the context of a transparent orthography, but they also show that the direct effect of reading fluency on reading comprehension wanes after the early school years."

Here we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine at what processing level the deficits in dyslexia emerge during a discrete-naming task. Dyslexic and skilled adult control readers performed a primed object-naming task, in which the relationship between the prime and the target was manipulated along perceptual, semantic and phonological dimensions. A 3×2 design that crossed Relationship Type (Visual, Phonemic Onset, and Semantic) with Relatedness (Related and Unrelated) was used. An attenuated N/P190 – indexing early visual processing – and N300 – which index late visual processing – was observed to pictures preceded by perceptually related (vs. unrelated) primes in the control but not in the dyslexic group. These findings suggest suboptimal processing in early stages of object processing in dyslexia, when integration and mapping of perceptual information to a more form-specific percept in memory take place. On the other hand, both groups showed an N400 effect associated with semantically related pictures (vs. unrelated), taken to reflect intact integration of semantic similarities in both dyslexic and control readers. We also found an electrophysiological effect of phonological priming in the N400 range – that is, an attenuated N400 to objects preceded by phonemic related primes vs. unrelated – while it showed a more widespread distributed and more pronounced over the right hemisphere in the dyslexics. Topographic differences between groups might have originated from a word form encoding process with different characteristics in dyslexics compared to control readers."

Reading, one of the most important cultural inventions of human society, critically depends on posterior brain areas of the left hemisphere in proficient adult readers. In children, this left hemispheric cortical specialization for letter strings is typically detected only after approximately 1 y of formal schooling and reading acquisition. Here, we recorded scalp electrophysiological (EEG) brain responses in 5-y-old (n = 40) prereaders presented with letter strings appearing every five items in rapid streams of pseudofonts (6 items per second). Within 2 min of recording only, letter strings evoked a robust specific response over the left occipito-temporal cortex at the predefined frequency of 1.2 Hz (i.e., 6 Hz/5). Interindividual differences in the amplitude of this electrophysiological response are significantly related to letter knowledge, a preschool predictor of later reading ability. These results point to the high potential of this rapidly collected behavior-free measure to assess reading ability in developmental populations. These findings were replicated in a second experiment (n = 26 preschool children), where familiar symbols and line drawings of objects evoked right-lateralized and bilaterally specific responses, respectively, showing the specificity of the early left hemispheric dominance for letter strings. Collectively, these findings indicate that limited knowledge of print in young children, before formal education, is sufficient to develop specialized left lateralized neuronal circuits, thereby pointing to an early onset and rapid impact of left hemispheric reentrant sound mapping on posterior cortical development."

Revista INFAD de psicología,"Margherita Maniscalco, Caterina Martorana, Barbara Caci, Vicenza Muratore","This contribution aims to underline the importance of some cognitive skills, called prerequisites, which are involved in the acquisition of reading and writing skills such as: knowledge of the alphabet; phonological awareness; the automatic rapid name (RAN); phonological memory and visual processing. Numerous researches, including international ones, show the importance of the exercise of such abilities within the kindergarten also for the purpose of preventing the development of learning difficulties and / or real disorders in the subsequent academic career of the child. Furthermore, the implementation of didactic interventions aimed at the development of such cognitive prerequisites favors the increase and / or recovery of the instrumentalities of the writing. In this scenario, it becomes essential to reflect on the methods of early screening that can be activated within the nursery school and on the related assessment tools that can be used. As a consequence, some of the main psychometric instruments published in Italy, from 1999 to date, have been reviewed for the evaluation of the prerequisites of bed-writing skills in students starting from 5 years of age."

Method: 105 children from second to fifth grades of elementary school were gathered into six groups: Dyslexia group (D; n=19), Language-based learning disability group (LBLD; n=16); their respective control groups paired according to different variables - age, gender, grade and school system (public or private) (D-control and LBLD-control); and other control groups paired according to different reading accuracy (D-accuracy; LBLD-accuracy). All of the children read an expository text and orally retold the story as they understood it. The analysis quantified propositions (main ideas and details) and retold links. A retelling reference standard (3-0) was also established from the best to the worst performance. We compared both clinical groups (D and LBLD) with their respective control groups by means of Mann-Whitney tests. Results: D showed the same total of propositions, links and reference standards as D-control, but performed better than D-accuracy in macro structural (total of links) and super structural (retelling reference standard) measures. Results suggest that dyslexic children are able to use their linguistic competence and their own background knowledge to minimize the effects of their decoding deficit, especially at the highest text processing levels. LBLD performed worse than LBLD-control in all of the retelling measures and LBLD showed worse performance than LBLD-accuracy in the total retold links and retelling reference standard. Those results suggest that both decoding and linguistic difficulties affect reading comprehension. Moreover, the linguistic deficits presented by LBLD students do not allow these pupils to perform as competently in terms of text comprehension as the children with dyslexia do. Thus, failure in the macro and super-structural information processing of the expository text were evidenced. Conclusion: Each clinical group showed a different retelling profile. Such findings support the view that there are differences between these two clinical populations in the non-phonological dimensions of language."

First, behavioural studies find that children with these neurodevelopmental disorders perform less well than peers on procedural learning tasks that depend on corticostriatal learning circuits. Second, fMRI studies in neurotypical adults implicate corticostriatal and hippocampal systems in language learning. Finally, structural and functional abnormalities are seen in the striatum in children with language disorders. Studying corticostriatal networks in developmental language disorders could offer us insights into their neurobiological basis and elucidate possible modes of compensation for intervention."

The sample comprised 40 students in 1st grade and 40 in 5th grade from a public state school with mean age of 6.2 and 9.8 years, respectively. The STPM was assessed using a standardized test of Pseudoword Repetition. PA was assessed through a Sequential Assessment Test (CONFIAS). Results: No difference was found between the students of 1st and 5th years in STPM both in total score and concerning the similarity of the pseudowords. Regarding PA, there was a significant difference among the percentage distribution of correct answers in syllabic and phonemic tasks, and the students from 5th grade presented better performance. Conclusion: At the beginning and at the end of the elementary school, there is no difference in STPM performance. On the other hand, there is difference in PA, which highlights the influence of schooling on PA development. The correlation between STPM and PA only in 5th-year students suggests that, at the beginning of literacy, STPM cannot be considered as a predictor to children's performance in PA. Nevertheless, as the schooling advances, there is influence of PA on STPM."

Neither parental education nor parenting stress significantly predicted parent-child literacy skill building activities, which appeared to be universal among families regardless of education or stress levels. Among all stress factors, parenting stress due to parent-child dysfunctional interaction (PCDI) appeared as the best predictor of general home-based involvement as well as modeling and monitoring in literacy by caregivers, explaining 9% and 6% of additional variance in these behaviors, after parental education was controlled.

Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that both types of metalinguistic awareness significantly predicted derived word reading in both languages. Subsequent cross-lagged panel modeling found construct-level transfer facilitation effect from Malay on English for phonological awareness but conversely from English on Malay for morphological awareness. Neither type of metalinguistic awareness exerted a transfer facilitation effect on word reading.

Visual pathway training in dyslexics to improve direction-discrimination of moving test patterns relative to a stationary background (figure/ground discrimination) significantly improved attention, reading fluency, both speed and comprehension, phonological processing, and both auditory and visual working memory relative to controls, whereas auditory training to improve phonological processing did not improve these academic skills significantly more than found for controls. This study supports the hypothesis that faulty timing in synchronizing the activity of magnocellular with parvocellular visual pathways is a fundamental cause of dyslexia, and argues against the assumption that reading deficiencies in dyslexia are caused by phonological deficits. This study demonstrates that visual movement direction-discrimination can be used to not only detect dyslexia early, but also for its successful treatment, so that reading problems do not prevent children from readily learning."

The chapter discusses the potential role of visual processing problems in reading disabilities. It also describes the visual perception and visual memory abilities of individuals who have difficulties in processing written language. A very high proportion of those designated as learning-disabled might more accurately be termed written-language-disabled, because their most salient difficulties are manifested in the areas of reading, spelling, handwriting, and written composition. Many learning-disabled individuals may also be language-disabled in a more general sense, showing problems in their receptive and expressive aural/oral language processes as well as in the written domain. Despite the fact that spelling, handwriting, and written composition difficulties are almost invariably involved, the term reading-disabled is commonly used to refer to those individuals who have written-language disabilities."

One explanation for the traditionally reported reading achievement plateau when students are D/HH is the inability to hear insalient English morphology. Signing Exact English can provide visual access to these features. The authors investigated the English morphological and syntactic abilities and reading achievement of elementary and middle school students at a school using simultaneously spoken and signed Standard American English facilitated by intentional listening, speech, and language strategies. A developmental trend (and no plateau) in language and reading achievement was detected; most participants demonstrated average or above-average English. Morphological awareness was prerequisite to high test scores; speech was not significantly correlated with achievement; language proficiency, measured by the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-4 (Semel, Wiig, & Secord, 2003), predicted reading achievement."

We found that Polish students with dyslexia, as compared with the controls, were less accurate and fluent in reading actual words and nonwords in L2. They made more phonological and orthographic errors in single L2 word spelling task; phonological spelling errors were more frequent than orthographic errors in both groups. The criterion group had more limited L2 vocabulary, regardless of the word difficulty. We also observed a positive correlation between the speed and accuracy of reading, and spelling in the two languages, though this relationship was more conspicuous in the control group. Our results corroborate Linguistic Coding Differences Hypothesis. Acquiring a second language poses substantial problems for the dyslexic students, who struggle with phonological processing deficits in L1 and L2."

Findings from this synthesis indicate that there may be no differential effects between repeated reading with or without a model for improving oral reading fluency of elementary students with LD. In addition, findings suggest that elementary students with LD may benefit from video modeling or word/phrase-based practices that provide opportunities to repeat misread words or phrases with words incorrectly read during the initial reading."

Second-order latent growth curve modeling was used to examine the longitudinal measurement invariance of the ORF measure, the growth in oral reading fluency within and across grades 2–5, the relative stability of the ORF measure, and the relationship between the ORF measure and high-stakes national tests of reading proficiency. Results showed that the ORF passages measured the same underlying construct, but some passages stood out regarding the invariance pattern. The oral reading fluency growth curve models demonstrated a linear growth in grades 2 and 3 and a nonlinear growth in grades 4 and 5. Initial individual differences varied more than growth rates, which for all were positive but largest in grades 3 and 4. High relative stability in the ORF measure was found across grades. The concurrent and predictive relations of the ORF measure on the Norwegian national reading tests were moderate to strong (range = .44–.75). Findings indicated that the ORF is a reliable and valid measure of reading in Norwegian grades 2–5 and easy and fast to administer. The ORF measure might contribute to early identification of students at risk for reading difficulties in an orthography more transparent than English.

Both parents were native Spanish speakers and the home language was Spanish; 37 were born in the United States and 21 were born in a Latin American country, but arrived to the US before the age of 10. Equivalent reading and writing tests were administered both in Spanish and English. Performance was significantly higher in English than in Spanish in the following tests: reading aloud (speed and errors), writing sentences, spontaneous writing number of words, and spontaneous writing errors (spelling and grammatical). When comparing those participants born in the US and abroad, no significant differences were found in Spanish, but in English; participants born in the US did better in reading aloud (errors), and spontaneous writing errors (spelling and grammatical). It was concluded that reading and writing abilities are in general higher in English than in Spanish in this group of bilinguals, which is correlated with the language used in the school they attended.

Tambyraja, Mary Beth Schmitt, Kelly Farquharson, Laura M. Justice","Background
Numerous studies suggest a positive relationship between the home literacy environment (HLE) and children's language and literacy skills, yet very little research has focused on the HLE of children with language impairment (LI). Children with LI are at risk for reading difficulties; thus, understanding the nature and frequency of their home literacy interactions is warranted.

Aims
To identify unique HLE profiles within a large sample of children with LI, and to determine relevant caregiver- and child-specific factors that predict children's profile membership.

Methods & Procedures
Participants were 195 kindergarten and first-grade children with LI who were receiving school-based language therapy. Caregivers completed a comprehensive questionnaire regarding their child's HLE, and the extent to which their child engaged in shared book reading, were taught about letters, initiated or asked to be read to, and chose to read independently. Caregivers also answered questions regarding the highest level of maternal education, caregiver history of reading difficulties, and caregiver reading habits. Children completed a language and literacy battery in the fall of their academic year.

Outcomes & Results
Latent profile analyses indicated a three-profile solution, representing high, average and low frequency of the selected HLE indicators. Multinomial regression further revealed that caregivers’ own reading habits influenced children's profile membership, as did child age and language abilities.

Conclusions & Implications
These results highlight the considerable variability in the frequency of home literacy interactions of children with LI. Future work examining relations between familial reading practices and literacy outcomes for children with LI is warranted."

Despite this designation, large disparities exist in the number of letter sounds children know at school entry. Enhancing caregivers' ability to teach their preschool-aged children letter sounds may represent an effective practice for reducing this variability and ensuring that more children are prepared to experience early school success. This study used a non-concurrent multiple-baseline-across-participants design to evaluate the effectiveness of caregivers ( N  = 3) delivering a computer-assisted tutoring program (Tutoring Buddy) targeting letter sound knowledge to their preschool-aged children. Visual analyses and effect size estimates derived from Percentage of All Non-Overlapping Data (PAND) statistics indicated consistent results for letter sound acquisition, as 6 weeks of intervention yielded large effects for letter sound knowledge (LSK) across all three children. Large effect sizes were also found for letter sound fluency (LSF) and nonsense word fluency (NWF) for two children. All three caregivers rated the intervention as highly usable and were able to administer it with high levels of fidelity. Taken together, the results of the present study found Tutoring Buddy to be an effective, simple, and usable way for the caregivers to support their children's literacy development."

To measure the motor skills of these children, 3 measurement scales were used: gross and fine motor skills measurement scales and body balance skill measurement. The descripƟ ve and analyƟ cal staƟ sƟ cal indices such as mean, standard deviaƟ on, mulƟ variable variance and Manova were used for data analysis. Results There was a meaningful difference in the gross and fine motor skills and body balance skill, (P<0.0001), between the NC and ID, auƟ sm and children with LD. Also, children with learning diorder obtained the maximum points in all of the skills and auƟ sm children acquired the minimum points. Conclusions According to the findings of the study, motor skills and body balance of children with learning disorder, auƟ sm and Intellectual disability is weaker than normal children. This indicates the need for increased educaƟ on of children with special needs at younger age. A B S T R A C T"

This study describes a protocol for identifying students at risk for reading difficulty during the kindergarten year. 
Methods: The authors piloted a protocol that included two reading screening instruments, a teacher questionnaire, a parent questionnaire and an oral language screening tool. Kindergarten children in two divergent elementary schools were screened. 
Results: Fifty-nine percent of the children screened demonstrated at least one warning sign warranting follow-up. The authors also found agreement among the results obtained through the various screening tools. Results were provided to first grade teachers the following year so that skill deficits could be addressed. Repeat screening of the children showed gains in skill development for 64% of the children in the follow-up phase.
Conclusion: Children at risk for early reading difficulties can be identified as early as during the kindergarten year. Early identification allows teachers to employ instructional techniques and strategies in an effort to remediate deficits before children demonstrate greater lags in skill development. While early identification is important for all children, it may be an even greater advantage for children entering school with the additional risk factors of social and economic disadvantage."

However, it is unclear if these predictors hold for readers across a range of word reading abilities. This study used quantile regression to investigate predictive relationships at different points in the distribution of word reading. Quantile regression analyses used preschool and kindergarten measures of letter knowledge, phonological awareness, rapid automatised naming, sentence repetition, vocabulary and mother's education to predict first-grade word reading. Predictors generally varied in significance across levels of word reading. Notably, rapid automatised naming was a significant unique predictor for average and good readers but not poor readers. Letter knowledge was generally a stronger unique predictor for poor and average readers than good readers. Well-known word reading predictors varied in significance at different points along the word reading distribution. Results have implications for early identification and statistical analyses of reading-related outcomes.


What is already known about this topic

Early predictors of word reading are well established, with letter knowledge, phonological awareness and rapid automatised naming identified as key predictors.
These relationships are primarily investigated in average readers, or in groups of good and poor readers separated by an arbitrary cut-off score.


What this paper adds

In this study, we used quantile regression to determine significant predictors of word reading across a range of word reading abilities.
The quantile regression approach avoids the loss of power that can arise when creating subgroups and has none of the issues associated with the use of a single, arbitrary cut-off score to separate good and poor readers.
Letter knowledge and phonological awareness were significantly predictive of word reading across the distribution of word reading abilities, whereas rapid automatised naming was significant only for good readers, and sentence recall was significant only for poor readers.


Implications for theory, policy and practice

Results reinforce the usefulness of measures such as letter knowledge, phonological awareness and sentence repetition in the early identification of children at risk for reading disabilities.
Results also suggest that measures of rapid naming may add little unique information in differentiating between children who subsequently read in the below-average range."

Norton, Georgios D. Sideridis, Sara D. Beach, Maryanne Wolf, John D. E. Gabrieli, Nadine Gaab","Research suggests that early identification of developmental dyslexia is important for mitigating the negative effects of dyslexia, including reduced educational attainment and increased socioemotional difficulties. The strongest pre-literacy predictors of dyslexia are rapid automatized naming (RAN), phonological awareness (PA), letter knowledge, and verbal short-term memory. The relationship among these constructs has been debated, and several theories have emerged to explain the unique role of each in reading ability/disability. Furthermore, the stability of identification of risk based on these measures varies widely across studies, due in part to the different cut-offs employed to designate risk. We applied a latent profile analysis technique with a diverse sample of 1215 kindergarten and pre-kindergarten students from 20 schools, to investigate whether PA, RAN, letter knowledge, and verbal short-term memory measures differentiated between homogenous profiles of performance on these measures. Six profiles of performance emerged from the data: average performers, below average performers, high performers, PA risk, RAN risk, and double-deficit risk (both PA and RAN). A latent class regression model was employed to investigate the longitudinal stability of these groups in a representative subset of children (n = 95) nearly two years later, at the end of 1st grade. Profile membership in the spring semester of pre-kindergarten or fall semester of kindergarten was significantly predictive of later reading performance, with the specific patterns of performance on the different constructs remaining stable across the years. There was a higher frequency of PA and RAN deficits in children from lower socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. There was no evidence for the IQ–achievement discrepancy criterion traditionally used to diagnose dyslexia. Our results support the feasibility of early identification of dyslexia risk and point to the heterogeneity of risk profiles. These findings carry important implications for improving outcomes for children with dyslexia, based on more targeted interventions."

Methods: Within a large, 5-year longitudinal study, children progressing from prekindergarten to second grade were administered a comprehensive set of prekindergarten measures of foundational language skills (vocabulary and grammar), higher-level language skills (inferencing, comprehension monitoring, and text structure knowledge), listening comprehension, working memory, and nonverbal processing, as well as second grade measures of listening comprehension. Results: A prekindergarten measure of listening comprehension—the Test of Narrative Language—and a prekindergarten measure of foundational language skills and working memory—the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-4 Recalling Sentences—were significant predictors of second grade listening comprehension. Conclusions: Our findings show that a quick, reliable measure of sentence imitation and/or listening comprehension, administered in prekindergarten, provides insight into a child's second grade listening comprehension.

Their parents were asked how old their children were when they first read to them and how often they had read to their children. Almost half of the study children were read to before they were 6 months old. The age at which children were first read to was closely associated with family characteristics such as socioeconomic status, the frequency with which children were read to as preschoolers, and with children’s linguistic and cognitive competencies.

A mixed-method, quasi-experimental design was constructed using propensity scores. Also investigated were the effects of the level of teacher literacy support on early literacy achievement and the interaction between Istation® use and the level of teacher literacy support. A descriptive discriminant analysis was performed to determine the main effect of Istation®. The level of teacher support and the interaction effect was then tested using a multivariate between-subject analysis. Results indicated that Istation® did have a statistically significant effect on the early literacy skills of the kindergarten students studied and could explain 17.7% of the variance in group differences. Teacher literacy support and the interaction between teacher support and Istation® were not significant. This study considers the relationship between technology and early literacy and concludes that Istation® can serve as a more knowledgeable other as students develop some early literacy skills; however, teachers are still needed to provide complete literacy instruction for young students."

Illner, Elke van der Meer, Angela D. Friederici","Abstract Intact phonological processing is crucial for successful literacy acquisition. While individuals with difficulties in reading and spelling (i.e., developmental dyslexia) are known to experience deficient phoneme discrimination (i.e., segmental phonology), findings concerning their prosodic processing (i.e., suprasegmental phonology) are controversial. Because there are no behavior-independent studies on the underlying neural correlates of prosodic processing in dyslexia, these controversial findings might be explained by different task demands. To provide an objective behavior-independent picture of segmental and suprasegmental phonological processing in impaired literacy acquisition, we investigated event-related brain potentials during passive listening in typically and poor-spelling German school children. For segmental phonology, we analyzed the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) during vowel length discrimination, capturing automatic auditory deviancy detection in repetitive contexts. For suprasegmental phonology, we analyzed the Closure Positive Shift (CPS) that automatically occurs in response to prosodic boundaries. Our results revealed spelling group differences for the MMN, but not for the CPS, indicating deficient segmental, but intact suprasegmental phonological processing in poor spellers. The present findings point towards a differential role of segmental and suprasegmental phonology in literacy disorders and call for interventions that invigorate impaired literacy by utilizing intact prosody in addition to training deficient phonemic awareness."

Hayiou-Thomas, Julia M. Carroll, Ruth Leavett, Charles Hulme, Margaret J. Snowling","Background
This study considers the role of early speech difficulties in literacy development, in the context of additional risk factors.

Method
Children were identified with speech sound disorder (SSD) at the age of 3½ years, on the basis of performance on the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology. Their literacy skills were assessed at the start of formal reading instruction (age 5½), using measures of phoneme awareness, word-level reading and spelling; and 3 years later (age 8), using measures of word-level reading, spelling and reading comprehension.

Results
The presence of early SSD conferred a small but significant risk of poor phonemic skills and spelling at the age of 5½ and of poor word reading at the age of 8. Furthermore, within the group with SSD, the persistence of speech difficulties to the point of school entry was associated with poorer emergent literacy skills, and children with ‘disordered’ speech errors had poorer word reading skills than children whose speech errors indicated ‘delay’. In contrast, the initial severity of SSD was not a significant predictor of reading development. Beyond the domain of speech, the presence of a co-occurring language impairment was strongly predictive of literacy skills and having a family risk of dyslexia predicted additional variance in literacy at both time-points.

Conclusions
Early SSD alone has only modest effects on literacy development but when additional risk factors are present, these can have serious negative consequences, consistent with the view that multiple risks accumulate to predict reading disorders."

Henderson, Meesha Warmington","Language acquisition is argued to be dependent upon an individuals’ sensitivity to serial-order regularities in the environment (sequential learning), and impairments in reading and spelling in dyslexia have recently been attributed to a deficit in sequential learning. The present study examined the learning and consolidation of sequential knowledge in 30 adults with dyslexia and 29 typical adults matched on age and nonverbal ability using two tasks previously reported to be sensitive to a sequence learning deficit. Both groups showed evidence of sequential learning and consolidation on a serial response time (SRT) task (i.e., faster and more accurate responses to sequenced spatial locations than randomly ordered spatial locations during training that persisted one week later). Whilst typical adults showed evidence of sequential learning on a Hebb repetition task (i.e., more accurate serial recall of repetitive sequences of nonwords versus randomly ordered sequences), adults with dyslexia showed initial advantages for repetitive versus randomly ordered sequences in the first half of training trials, but this effect disappeared in the second half of trials. This Hebb repetition effect was positively correlated with spelling in the dyslexic group; however, there was no correlation between sequential learning on the two tasks, placing doubt over whether sequential learning in different modalities represents a single capacity. These data suggest that sequential learning difficulties in adults with dyslexia are not ubiquitous, and when present may be a consequence of task demands rather than sequence learning per se."

Although effective phonological awareness training programs exist, children at risk often do not reach similar levels of phonological awareness after the intervention as children with normally developed skills. Based on theoretical considerations and first promising results the present study explores effects of an early musical training in combination with a conventional phonological training in children with weak phonological awareness skills. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design and measurements across a period of two years, we tested the effects of two interventions: a consecutive combination of a musical and a phonological training and a phonological training alone. The design made it possible to disentangle effects of the musical training alone as well the effects of its combination with the phonological training. The outcome measures of these groups were compared with the control group with multivariate analyses, controlling for a number of background variables. The sample included N = 424 German-speaking children aged 4 to 5 years at the beginning of the study. We found a positive relationship between musical abilities and phonological awareness. Yet, whereas the well-established phonological training produced the expected effects, adding a musical training did not contribute significantly to phonological awareness development. Training effects were partly dependent on the initial level of phonological awareness. Possible reasons for the lack of training effects in the musical part of the combination condition as well as practical implications for early literacy education are discussed."

In turn, processes associated with reading comprehension are discussed in regard to lower order skills, higher order skills, and construction–integration models. The chapter then considers the early development of reading-related skills and discusses the behavior genetics of these skills and emergent literacy and its development. Issues related to the nature and identification of reading difficulties and disorders are discussed, and, finally, different approaches to reading instruction and the evidence in support of these approaches, with a focus on early instruction, are described.

Approximately 50% of English words can be decoded by following a sound-symbol correspondence rule alone and an additional 36% are spelled with only one error. Many students with reading disabilities or who struggle to learn to read have difficulty with phonology, an understanding of how sounds are organized within language. This can result in difficulty grasping the alphabetic principle, the knowledge of the relation between speech sounds and the letters/letter patterns that represent them. Research has demonstrated the benefits of intensive, explicit instruction for developing struggling readers’ capacity to identify phonemes and apply knowledge of phoneme-grapheme correspondence for decoding.

This study examined the development of stress sensitivity and its relationship with word reading. Previous research has rarely measured phoneme and stress sensitivity in the same task, making a direct comparison of the contribution between the two in reading development difficult.

Methods
Participants were native English-speaking adults and children at ages of 6, 8, and 10 years (N = 24, 22, 22, and 24, respectively). A lexical decision task was used to measure both stress and phoneme sensitivity. Oral vocabulary, phoneme awareness, and word reading were assessed.

Results
Stress sensitivity accounted for unique variance in reading over and above vocabulary and phoneme awareness in 6-year-olds. Both adults and children had better phoneme sensitivity than stress sensitivity.

Conclusions
These findings highlight the unique contribution of stress sensitivity in reading development. The current study made a novel contribution to studying the relationship between prosody and literacy by utilising a task that is able to assess children's stress and phoneme sensitivity simultaneously.


What is already known about this topic

Prosody plays an important role in literacy acquisition across a variety of languages with word stress.
Phoneme awareness as measured by the phoneme deletion task is one of the strongest predictors of reading development in English.
Stress sensitivity may contribute to reading via vocabulary development, rime awareness, phoneme awareness, and morphological awareness.


What this paper adds

Stress sensitivity made a unique contribution to word reading over and above oral vocabulary and phoneme awareness for 6-year-old children.
Both stress and phoneme sensitivity was measured within the same task using the same set of materials.
Both children and adults showed better phoneme sensitivity compared to stress sensitivity.


Implications for theory, policy, or practice

Models delineating the relationship between prosody and literacy should consider unique variance explained by stress sensitivity in reading development.
Children learning to read in English may need longer literacy exposure to develop better stress sensitivity because of the lack of regularity in English stress.
Stress sensitivity may contribute to word reading given that it may help children understand stress assignment and learn unfamiliar stress representation as well as orthographic stress regularities."

The aim of the present study was: (1) to examine Spoken Arabic (SpA) and Standard Arabic (StA) voweled and unvoweled word reading among native-speaking sixth graders with developmental dyslexia; and (2) to determine whether SpA reading ability among children with dyslexia predicts StA reading fluency in the two orthographies: voweled and unvoweled. A comparison was made to three age groups of typically developing children: a group matched by chronological age, a group of children who are two years younger, and a group of children who are 4 years younger. Findings show that diglossia has a strong impact on reading ability in dyslexic children. Moreover, vowelization plays a pivotal role in the reading ability of Arabic-speaking children with dyslexia in both SpA and StA. This role is evident in the different performance patterns of dyslexic participants as compared with controls on word-reading accuracy and fluency for SpA versus StA. Finally, StA word-reading fluency appears to depend on and to be reliably and powerfully predicted by SpA word-level reading ability. These results underscore the role of diglossia and vowelization in the manifestation of dyslexia in Arabic-speaking children."

The analysis was conducted on a large and representative sample using path models. The results revealed that, together with the consistent contribution of PA and orthography, morphology played an important role in predicting spelling. Furthermore, our findings suggested that Arabic orthography, even the vowelised version which is considered as transparent (since it provides the reader with the full phonological information), behaved as other deep orthographies in spelling. These findings are discussed in the context of the unique characteristics of the Arabic language and its orthographic system."

Georgiou, Naoko Muroya, Hisao Maekawa, Rauno Parrila","We examined the role of different cognitive skills in word reading (accuracy and fluency) and spelling accuracy in syllabic Hiragana and morphographic Kanji. Japanese Hiragana and Kanji are strikingly contrastive orthographies: Hiragana has consistent character-sound correspondences with a limited symbol set, whereas Kanji has inconsistent character-sound correspondences with a large symbol set. One hundred sixty-nine Japanese children were assessed at the beginning of grade 1 on reading accuracy and fluency, spelling, phonological awareness, phonological memory, rapid automatized naming (RAN), orthographic knowledge, and morphological awareness, and on reading and spelling at the middle of grade 1. The results showed remarkable differences in the cognitive predictors of early reading accuracy and spelling development in Hiragana and Kanji, and somewhat lesser differences in the predictors of fluency development. Phonological awareness was a unique predictor of Hiragana reading accuracy and spelling, but its impact was relatively weak and transient. This finding is in line with those reported in consistent orthographies with contained symbol sets such as Finnish and Greek. In contrast, RAN and morphological awareness were more important predictors of Kanji than of Hiragana, and the patterns of relationships for Kanji were similar to those found in inconsistent orthographies with extensive symbol sets such as Chinese. The findings suggested that Japanese children learning two contrastive orthographic systems develop partially separate cognitive bases rather than a single basis for literacy acquisition."

Bilinguals were not expected to fail in English measures, and their gap with monolinguals would be expected to be limited to the instructional language, owing to underexposure. All participants were enrolled in Italian primary schools (fourth and fifth grades). A non-verbal reasoning task and Italian and English literacy tasks were administered. The Italian battery included word and non-word reading (speed and accuracy), word and non-word writing, and reading comprehension; the English battery included similar tasks, except for the non-word writing. Bilingual children performed similarly to typical readers in English tasks, whereas in Italian tasks, their performance was similar to that of typical readers in reading speed but not in reading accuracy and writing. Children with dyslexia underperformed compared with typically developing children in all English and Italian tasks, except for reading comprehension in Italian. Profile analysis and correlational analyses were further discussed.

A representative sample of 973 Dutch children in the first grade (M age = 6;1, SD = 0;5) was exposed to incremental subsets of Dutch grapheme–phoneme correspondences during 6 consecutive blocks of 3 weeks of phonics instruction. Children’s accuracy and efficiency of curriculum embedded word decoding were assessed after each incremental block, followed by a standardized word decoding measurement. Precursor measures of rapid naming, short-term memory, vocabulary, phonological awareness, and letter knowledge were assessed by the end of kindergarten and subsequently related to the word decoding efficiency in the first grade. The results showed that from the very beginning, children attained ceiling levels of decoding accuracy, whereas their efficiency scores increased despite the incremental character of the consecutive decoding assessments embedded in the curriculum. Structural equation modelling demonstrated high stability of the individual differences assessed by word decoding efficiency during phonics instruction during the first 5 months of the first grade. Curriculum embedded word decoding was highly related to standardized word decoding after phonics instruction was completed. Finally, early literacy and lexical retrieval, and to a lesser extent verbal and visual short term memory, predicted the first fundamental processes of mastering word decoding skills."

Groen, Takayuki Ito, Ana A. Francisco, Vincent L. Gracco, Kenneth R. Pugh, Ludo Verhoeven","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine whether developmental dyslexia (DD) is characterized by deficiencies in speech sensory and motor feedforward and feedback mechanisms, which are involved in the modulation of phonological representations.
Method: A total of 42 adult native speakers of Dutch (22 adults with DD; 20 participants who were typically reading controls) were asked to produce /bep/ while the first formant (F1) of the /e/ was not altered (baseline), increased (ramp), held at maximal perturbation (hold), and not altered again (after-effect). The F1 of the produced utterance was measured for each trial and used for statistical analyses. The measured F1s produced during each phase were entered in a linear mixed-effects model.
Results: Participants with DD adapted more strongly during the ramp phase and returned to baseline to a lesser extent when feedback was back to normal (after-effect phase) when compared with the typically reading group. In this study, a faster deviation from baseline during the ramp phase, a stronger adaptation response during the hold phase, and a slower return to baseline during the after-effect phase were associated with poorer reading and phonological abilities.
Conclusion: The data of the current study are consistent with the notion that the phonological deficit in DD is associated with a weaker sensorimotor magnet for phonological representations."

Even when children with dyslexia have learned the letters and their corresponding speech sounds, letter-speech sound associations might still be less automatized compared to children with age-adequate literacy skills. In order to examine automaticity in letter-speech sound associations and to overcome some of the disadvantages associated with the frequently used visual-auditory oddball paradigm, we developed a novel electrophysiological letter-speech sound interference paradigm. This letter-speech sound interference paradigm was applied in a group of nine-year-old children with dyslexia (n=36) and a group of typically developing (TD) children of similar age (n=37). Participants had to indicate whether two letters look visually the same. In the incongruent condition (e.g. the letter pair A-a) there was a conflict between the visual information and the automatically activated phonological information; although the visual appearance of the two letters is different, they are both associated with the same speech sound. This conflict resulted in slower response times (RTs) in the incongruent than in the congruent (e.g. the letter pair A-e) condition. Furthermore, in the TD control group, the conflict resulted in fast and strong event-related potential (ERP) effects reflected in less negative N1 amplitudes and more positive conflict slow potentials (cSP) in the incongruent than in the congruent condition. However, the dyslexic group did not show any conflict-related ERP effects, implying that letter-speech sound associations are less automatized in this group. Furthermore, we examined general visual conflict processing in a control visual interference task, using false fonts. The conflict in this experiment was based purely on the visual similarity of the presented objects. Visual conflict resulted in slower RTs, less negative N2 amplitudes and more positive cSP in both groups. Thus, on a general, basic level, visual conflict processing does not seem to be affected in children with dyslexia."

Method We analyzed the degree to which three emergent-literacy skills (i.e., alphabet knowledge, print-concept knowledge, and phonological awareness) of 35 children ages three- to five-years-old with ASD predicted decoding and the degree to which associations differed from a comparison group of 73 TD children. We hypothesized that all emergent-literacy skills would predict later decoding for both groups of children and that autism status would moderate the association between print-concept knowledge and decoding. Results We found that phonological awareness was a statistically significant predictor of later decoding for children with ASD, but we did not find any evidence that ASD status moderated the relationships between emergent-literacy skills and decoding. Conclusions Based on these findings, early educators should consider emergent-literacy skills to be important learning targets for young children with ASD, just as they are for children without disabilities. Furthermore, phonological awareness might be even more important for young children with ASD than for children without disabilities."

Using longitudinal reading scores of 6,874 students in 424 schools in 12 sites across Africa and Asia, there was 1) a modest but consistent relationship between students’ home literacy environments and reading scores, and 2) a strong relationship between reading gains and participation in community reading activities, suggesting that interventions should consider both home and community learning environments and their differential influences on interventions across different low-resource settings."

C. Wesseling, Corinna A. Christmann, Thomas Lachmann","Effects of shared book reading on expressive vocabulary and grapheme awareness without letter instruction in German kindergarteners (longitudinal; N = 69, 3;0 - 4;8 years) were investigated. Expressive vocabulary was measured by using a standardized test; grapheme awareness was measured by asking children to identify one grapheme per trial presented amongst non-letter distractors. Two methods of shared book reading were investigated, literacy enrichment (additional books) and teacher training in shared book reading strategies, both without explicit letter instruction. Whereas positive effects of shared book reading on expressive vocabulary were evident in numerous previous studies, the impact of shared book reading on grapheme awareness has not yet been investigated. Both methods resulted in positive effects on children’s expressive vocabulary and grapheme awareness over a period of six months. Thus, early shared book reading may not only be considered to be a tool for promoting the development of expressive vocabulary, but also for implicit acquisition of grapheme awareness. The latter is considered an important precondition required for the explicit learning of grapheme-phoneme-conversion rules (letter knowledge)."

Currently, only a few case reports are available on SLI in Dravidian languages. The morphological complexity inherent to Dravidian languages such as Kannada provides a potential avenue to verify one of the two prevailing accounts of SLI: the morphological richness theory and CGC (Computational Grammatical Complexity) hypothesis. While the previous theory predicts the relatively spared performance of children with SLI (CwSLI) on syntactic morphology in morphologically complex languages, the latter predicts a diametrically opposite performance. Data from a group of 15 Kannada-speaking CwSLI supported the morphological richness theory, and further revealed five distinct profiles of SLI. The results of this study reflected that CwSLI learning the agglutinative language (Kannada) as compared with language-matched children without SLI, displayed some shared deficits (e.g., in phonological processing on a non-word repetition task) with CwSLI learning English. However, CwSLI learning the morphosyntactically rich language Kannada differed remarkably from English-learning CwSLI by not showing deficits in syntactic morphology relative to language-matched peers (e.g., PNG, verb, tense, case, and pronoun)."

In Malaysia, literacy skills are generally only taught in the classroom. However, research shows that the home and school are overlapping ‘spheres of influence’. Children learn emergent and social literacy practices prior to school age and these are powerful factors towards future success in school. This paper stems from the findings from the Multimodal Community Literacy project, which was a day-long literacy event which used multiliteracies (arts and crafts, songs, videos, movies, and storytelling) to facilitate an understanding of and participation in social literacy practices among working class parents’. The participants comprised administrative staff with young children, aged 2 to 8, from the Institute of Teacher Education in (city), Malaysia. This case study used structured questionnaire triangulated with parent and caregiver interviews. The project assessed family’s understanding, access, frequency and types of social literacy practices applied at home. The findings revealed that parents’ belief in what constituted literacy practices differed from research defined social literacy practices. Finally, this article provides examples of parent teacher collaborations to increase social literacy practices towards student success in school."

Snowling, Charles Hulme","Background
Oral language skills are a critical foundation for literacy and more generally for educational success. The current study shows that oral language skills can be improved by providing suitable additional help to children with language difficulties in the early stages of formal education.

Methods
We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 394 children in England, comparing a 30-week oral language intervention programme starting in nursery (N = 132) with a 20-week version of the same programme starting in Reception (N = 133). The intervention groups were compared to an untreated waiting control group (N = 129). The programmes were delivered by trained teaching assistants (TAs) working in the children's schools/nurseries. All testers were blind to group allocation.

Results
Both the 20- and 30-week programmes produced improvements on primary outcome measures of oral language skill compared to the untreated control group. Effect sizes were small to moderate (20-week programme: d = .21; 30-week programme: d = .30) immediately following the intervention and were maintained at follow-up 6 months later. The difference in improvement between the 20-week and 30-week programmes was not statistically significant. Neither programme produced statistically significant improvements in children's early word reading or reading comprehension skills (secondary outcome measures).

Conclusions
This study provides further evidence that oral language interventions can be delivered successfully by trained TAs to children with oral language difficulties in nursery and Reception classes. The methods evaluated have potentially important policy implications for early education."

Study design Participants were drawn from a longitudinal, community cohort. Assessment at age 4 years (N = 1494) identified children with speech errors. Reassessment at age 7 years allowed categorization into resolved or persistent categories. Logistic regression examined predictors of speech outcome, including family history, sex, socioeconomic status, nonverbal intelligence, and speech error type (delay vs disorder). Results At age 7 years, persistent errors were seen in over 40% of children who had errors at age 4 years. Speech symptomatology was the only significant predictor of outcome ( P  = .02). Children with disordered errors at age 4 years were twice as likely to have poor speech outcomes at age 7 years compared with those with delayed errors. Conclusions Children with speech delay at age 4 years seem more likely to resolve, and this might justify a ""watch and wait"" approach. In contrast, those with speech disorder at age 4 years appear to be at greater risk for persistent difficulties, and could be prioritized for therapy to offset long-term impacts."

The results indicated that all three WM components predicted word problem solving in the nonmediated model, but only the storage component of WM yielded a significant direct path to word problem-solving accuracy in the fully mediated model. Fluid intelligence was found to moderate the relationship between WM and word problem solving, whereas reading, calculation, and related skills (naming speed, domain-specific knowledge) completely mediated the influence of the executive system on problem-solving accuracy.

Quantile regressions were formulated to estimate these relations across the full skill span of each outcome. Reading-related attributions predicted contextual word recognition, sight word and decoding fluency, and comprehension skills. Attributions to ability in success situations were positively related to each outcome across the full span. On three reading outcomes, this relation strengthened at higher skill levels. Attributions to effort in success situations were consistently and negatively related to all reading outcomes. The results provide evidence that the strength of the relation between reading and attributions varies according to reading skill levels, with the strongest evidence for ability-based attributions in situations of reading success."

To examine potential differences, we studied reading processes on different proficiency and complexity levels. Specifically, we used data from the standardization sample of the German reading comprehension test ELFE II (n = 2,807), which assesses reading at word, sentence, and text level with separate speeded subtests. Children from grades 1 to 6 completed either a test version on paper or via computer under time constraints. In general, children in the screen condition worked faster but at the expense of accuracy. This difference was more pronounced for younger children and at the word level.

We predict that improving the speed and sensitivity of figure-ground movement discrimination (PATH to Reading neurotraining) remediating visual timing deficits in the dorsal stream, improves processing speed and reading fluency, and the executive control functions of attention and working memory in both dyslexic and normal students who had PATH neurotraining more than in those students who had no neurotraining. This prediction was evaluated by measuring whether dyslexic and normal students improved on standardized tests of cognitive skills following neurotraining exercises, more than following computer-based guided reading (Raz-Kids). The neurotraining used in this study, visually-based training designed to improve magnocellular function at both low and high levels in the dorsal stream, the input to the executive control networks coding working memory and attention, represents a paradigm shift from the phonologically-based treatment for dyslexia, which concentrates on high-level speech and reading areas. This randomized controlled-validation study was conducted by training the entire 2nd and 3rd grade classrooms (42 students) for 30 minutes twice a week before guided reading. Standardized tests were administered at the beginning and end of 12-weeks of intervention training to evaluate improvements in academic skills. Only movement-discrimination training remediated both low-level visual timing deficits and high-level cognitive functioning, including selective and sustained attention, reading fluency, and working memory for both dyslexic and normal students. Remediating visual timing deficits in the dorsal stream revealed the causal role of visual movement discrimination training in improving high-level cognitive functions such as attention, reading acquisition, and working memory. This study supports the hypothesis that faulty timing in synchronizing the activity of magnocellular with parvocellular visual pathways in the dorsal stream is a fundamental cause of dyslexia and being at-risk for reading problems in normal students, and argues against the assumption that reading deficiencies in dyslexia are caused by phonological or language deficits, requiring a paradigm shift from phonologically-based treatment of dyslexia to a visually-based treatment."

Students responded by keyboard with accurate recordings of response-onset latency (RT) and inter-keypress interval (IKI). We determined effects of a number of child-level cognitive ability factors, and of word-level factors—particularly the location within the word of a spelling challenge (e.g., letter doubling), if present. Spelling accuracy was predicted by word reading (word split) performance, non-word spelling accuracy, keyboard key-finding speed and short-term memory span. Word reading performance predicted accuracy just for words with spelling challenges. For correctly spelled words, RT was predicted by non-word spelling response time and by speed on a key-finding task, and mean IKI by non-verbal cognitive ability, word reading, non-word spelling response time, and key-finding speed. Compared to words with no challenge, mean IKI was shorter for words with an initial challenge and longer for words with a mid-word challenge. These findings suggest that spelling is not fully planned when typing commences, a hypothesis that is confirmed by the fact that IKI immediately before within word challenges were reliably longer than elsewhere within the same word. Taken together our findings imply that routine classroom spelling tests better capture student competence if they focus not only on accuracy but also on production time course."

Higher reading and writing achievement correlated with engaging in more home literacy activities. Parental help or monitoring of home literacy activities was greater for low-achieving than for high-achieving readers or writers. Children engaged more minutes per week in reading than writing activities at home, but parents provided more help with writing and reported computers were used more for homework than for school literacy instruction. Parental ratings of self-regulation of attention remained stable, but executive functions—goal-setting, hyperactivity, and impulsivity—tended to improve. Results are translated into consultatio..."

German children do not formally learn letter-sounds before school entry. In this study, we evaluated kindergarten children's sensitivity to the frequency of letters and visually similar symbols in child-directed texts, how it develops and whether it predicts early reading abilities.

Method
In a longitudinal study from kindergarten to primary school, children were asked to judge whether a presented alphabetic (e.g., A) or non-alphabetic symbol (e.g., #) was a letter. High and low frequency was varied for both types of symbols. Furthermore, we analysed whether later reading abilities were predicted by this letter judgement ability.

Results
Before school entry, children had difficulties in distinguishing frequent non-alphabetic symbols from letters. Furthermore, letter judgement in kindergarten predicted reading abilities in first grade.

Conclusions
Children derive some knowledge about letters from the frequency of co-occurrence of letters and symbols in texts. The ability to distinguish letters from non-alphabetic symbols predicts early reading."

Hurtubise, Antonette Scavone, Sanya Sagar, Laszlo A. Erdodi","The article reviews systemic and context-specific challenges of psychoeducational assessment using two case studies: a 19-year-old woman with feigned attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and a 50-year-old man with genuine dyslexia. These cases demonstrate that providing a thorough evaluation of performance validity is an essential component of determining eligibility for academic accommodations in both clinical and higher education settings. At the same time, discounting failure on certain performance validity tests may be necessary to protect against false positive errors. In addition, empirically based test selection and interpretation has the potential to enhance the clinical confidence during differential diagnosis. Examining the internal consistency of a given neurocognitive profile provides valuable clinical information to determine both the credibility of the overall presentation and applying established diagnostic criteria. Although clinical research has yet to identify definitive markers of non-credible neurocognitive profiles, a multivariate approach to performance validity assessment that combines empirically validated indicators and sound clinical judgment can improve detection rates while simultaneously protecting against false positive errors."

In this 5-year longitudinal study, starting at age 7.5 years (n = 198), it was found that the shared variance between vocabulary, grammar, verbal working memory, and inference skills was a powerful longitudinal predictor of variations in both listening and reading comprehension. In line with the simple view of reading, listening comprehension, and word decoding, together with their interaction and curvilinear effects, explains almost all (96%) variation in early reading comprehension skills. Additionally, listening comprehension was a predictor of both the early and later growth of reading comprehension skills."

Feasibility was assessed via: (1) recruitment, attendance, and retention rates; (2) associations between program attendance and children's language and literacy growth, and (3) parents' and school staff's perspectives about the program's strengths and barriers to participation and implementation. Participants were 68 low-income Latino parents and their kindergarten children, 3 school principals and 3 family liaisons. The observed recruitment, attendance and retention rates met or exceeded the expected rates. Program attendance was positively related to growth in children's vocabulary, but not decoding or early writing. A main strength of the program was community building and a main barrier to participation was parents' work schedules. Implications for future intervention programs working with Latino families are discussed."

Many causal explanations have been proposed, based on the range of impairments displayed by affected individuals. Here we draw attention to the fact that many of these impairments are also shown by illiterate individuals who have not received any or very little reading instruction. We suggest that this fact may not be coincidental and that the performance differences of both illiterates and individuals with dyslexia compared to literate controls are, to a substantial extent, secondary consequences of either reduced or suboptimal reading experience or a combination of both. The search for the primary causes of reading impairments will make progress if the consequences of quantitative and qualitative differences in reading experience are better taken into account and not mistaken for the causes of reading disorders. We close by providing four recommendations for future research."

Previous studies have shown that RAN is an independent and robust predictor for reading skills in children. Less research investigated the incremental contributions of distinct RAN measures to reading skills in beginning readers. Ninety-three children from kindergarten and first grade completed four different RAN measures involving color, digit, vowel, and consonant naming at the end of the school year. Six months later these children were either in first or in second grade and completed several reading measures. The results emphasize that vowel RAN was a strong and unique predictor for reading accuracy in first grade. Vowel RAN and digit RAN were both significant predictors for reading speed in second grade. The current findings underline that vowel RAN is a promising predictor for reading outcomes (i.e., accuracy and speed) at the beginning of elementary school. RAN performance did however not significantly predict second grade reading comprehension. Results and practical implications will be discussed."

We investigate sentence repetition in 5- to 8-year-old native speakers of Kannada, an inflectionally rich language of India. The inflectional characteristics of the language make it an ideal testing ground for exploring the engagement of grammatical and phonological encoding processes. We presented active, passive, and embedded sentences and, in a subset of the material, we also manipulated sentence length. Using accuracy and speech error analyses at the sentence, word, and affix levels, we provide evidence that individual differences in task performance are influenced by the linguistic properties of the material. These findings clarify the role of key language production mechanisms involved in sentence repetition. We propose that it is the versatility to develop a profile across several language production mechanisms that makes sentence repetition particularly useful as a clinical tool."

The current investigations emphasize the need to study in depth the most specific relation that there take the different linguistic components delayed as regards the reading comprehension as its possible implication in the Difficulties of Learning. We present a study of 120 children - divided in two groups of ages understood between 6 to 10 years and 11 to 15 years - with semantic and/or syntactic linguistic difficulties of verifying how the different nature of the linguistic debts influences both the comprehensive reading of the written text, and the possible cognitive strategies used for its assimilation and later learning. The results show the significant relation between the Debts of the Language and the Difficulties in the Reading Comprehension between 6 and 10 years and that, also, the different cognitive processes used in the comprehensive reading depends on the nature of the backward linguistic component. Equally, we observe that the difficulties in the written expression are related to the proper nature and type of the expressive linguistic delay. We consider opportune to study in depth the knowledge of the different syntactic structures, as well as of the level of acquisition of the vocabulary, and its implication in the Difficulties of Learning presented during the stage of Primary education, to prevent, as far as possible, the defeat and school abandonment produced during the stage of Secondary."

Monaco, John F. Stein, M Zheng, C Suk-Han Ho, C McBride, Margaret J. Snowling, Charles Hulme, Marianna E. Hayiou-Thomas, M M Y Waye, Joel B. Talcott, Silvia Paracchini","Dyslexia is a specific impairment in learning to read and has strong heritability. An intronic deletion within the DCDC2 gene, with ~8% frequency in European populations, is increasingly used as a marker for dyslexia in neuroimaging and behavioral studies. At a mechanistic level, this deletion has been proposed to influence sensory processing capacity, and in particular sensitivity to visual coherent motion. Our re-assessment of the literature, however, did not reveal strong support for a role of this specific deletion in dyslexia. We also analyzed data from five distinct cohorts, enriched for individuals with dyslexia, and did not identify any signal indicative of associations for the DCDC2 deletion with reading-related measures, including in a combined sample analysis (N=526). We believe we conducted the first replication analysis for a proposed deletion effect on visual motion perception and found no association (N=445 siblings). We also report that the DCDC2 deletion has a frequency of 37.6% in a cohort representative of the general population recruited in Hong Kong (N=220). This figure, together with a lack of association between the deletion and reading abilities in this cohort, indicates the low likelihood of a direct deletion effect on reading skills. Therefore, on the basis of multiple strands of evidence, we conclude that the DCDC2 deletion is not a strong risk factor for dyslexia. Our analyses and literature re-evaluation are important for interpreting current developments within multidisciplinary studies of dyslexia and, more generally, contribute to current discussions about the importance of reproducibility in science."

In the present study, we examined the relationship between word decoding ability and three different phonological skills; phonemic awareness, verbal short-term memory (V-STM), and rapid automatic naming (RAN) in 1007 Scandinavian third- and fifth-graders. In the first part of the study, we sought to investigate the influence of the three phonological skills on word decoding ability. Using multiple regression analysis, our result clearly demonstrated that phonemic awareness was the most powerful phonological skill explaining variance in word decoding ability among average decoders. Among children with poor decoding skills, however, RAN was the most important factor in Grade 3, whereas V-STM was the main contributor to decoding ability among children in Grade 5. In the second part of the research, we examined the relationship between poor phonological skills and word decoding ability. Interestingly, our result revealed that approximately one half of the children with phonological difficulties, still performed within the average range with regard to word decoding ability. However, our analyses confirmed earlier research concerning the severe word decoding difficulties children with both poor phonemic awareness and restricted V-STM, experience."

This study examines naturalistic language and literacy teaching by 39 sibling dyads, at two timepoints, when children were ages 2 and 4 (time 1; T1) and again at ages 4 and 6 (time 2; T2). Each family was observed for a total of six 90-minute sessions at both timepoints. First, all sibling-directed teaching sequences were identified, including instances of formal and informal teaching. Second, sequences were coded for evidence of language (i.e., vocabulary, book concepts, songs, phonological awareness) and literacy concepts (i.e., alphabetic principle, reading, writing, spelling). Over 40% of the T1 and T2 teaching sequences involved language and literacy concepts. Older siblings taught the majority of the time at T1 and T2; however, the number of sequences taught by younger siblings increased proportionally over time. Because siblings taught vocabulary concepts significantly most often at both T1 and T2, further analyses were conducted on vocabulary subcategories (i.e., expansion, discussing pictures, relaying word meaning, checking for listener understanding, second-language instruction). Significantly more teaching sequences involved expansion than other vocabulary subcategories at both timepoints. Finally, at T2, literacy concepts (i.e., writing, spelling) were taught significantly more than at T1. Our findings demonstrate that siblings are interested in teaching each other a variety of language and literacy concepts during naturalistic interactions in the home, indicating that siblings contribute to the richness of the home literacy environment."

The time is now ripe to reappraise the considerable amount of data gathered with MRI using different types of sequences (T1, diffusion, spectroscopy) and analysed using different methods (manual, voxel-based or surface-based morphometry, fractional anisotropy and tractography, multivariate analyses…). While selective reviews of mostly small-scale studies seem to provide a coherent view of the brain disruptions that are typical of dyslexia, involving left perisylvian and occipito-temporal regions, we argue that this view may be deceptive and that meta-analyses and large-scale studies rather highlight many inconsistencies and limitations. We discuss problems inherent to small sample size as well as methodological difficulties that still undermine the discovery of reliable neuroanatomical bases of dyslexia, and we outline some recommendations to further improve this research area."

Semi-structured interviews with parents (N = 8), of children aged between 37 months and 59 months (M = 47.5 months), were used to investigate child interactions and specific parental views and experiences in relation to mathematical practices at home. Thematic analysis was used to explore behaviour relevant to the home numeracy environment. Six recurrent themes from the interview responses were identified: numeracy environment structure, frequency of number-related experiences, levels of number knowledge, technology attitudes, parent-child interactions and social interaction. The diversity of the themes developed in this study illustrate how the home numeracy environment could be influenced by parents' views and experiences of numeracy-related activities, reported behaviours of their child and children's interactions with others."

One hundred fifty-nine English-speaking Canadian, 238 French-speaking Canadian, and 224 Greek children were assessed at the beginning of Grade 2 on measures of morphological awareness, phonological awareness, and RAN. At the end of Grade 2, they were assessed on reading accuracy, reading fluency, reading comprehension, and spelling to dictation. The results indicated that morphological awareness was a unique predictor of reading comprehension and spelling in all three languages, of reading fluency in English and French, and of reading accuracy in English only. Furthermore, the results of multigroup analyses revealed no significant differences in the contribution of morphological awareness to the literacy outcomes across languages. Theoretical and practical implications of these finding are discussed."

The development of emergent literacy skills depends upon the literacy environments and experiences of children at home. Children’s home literacy environment is closely related to the development of various aspects of emergent literacy like letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and vocabulary. Dimensions of home literacy environment, such as physical (literacy) environment, child’s own literacy habits, parental literacy habits, parent-child interaction for language and literacy activities, and parental beliefs about literacy, have been reported in literature."

It is widely believed that increasing parental involvement can improve children's educational outcomes although we lack good evidence for such claims. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a parent-delivered early language enrichment programme.

Methods
We conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 208 preschool children and their parents living in socially diverse areas in the United Kingdom. Families were allocated to an oral language programme (N = 103) or an active control programme targeting motor skills (N = 105). Parents delivered the programmes to their child at home in daily 20-min sessions over 30 weeks of teaching.

Results
Children receiving the language programme made significantly larger gains in language (d = .21) and narrative skills (d = .36) than children receiving the motor skills programme at immediate posttest. Effects on language were maintained 6 months later (d = .34), and at this point, the language group also scored higher on tests of early literacy (d values=.35 and .42). There was no evidence that the movement programme improved motor skills.

Conclusions
This study provides evidence for the effectiveness of a parent-delivered language enrichment programme. Further large-scale evaluations of the programme are needed to confirm and extend these findings."

The performances on prosodic tasks (prosodic perception, rise-time perception), phonological tasks (phonological awareness, rapid naming, verbal working memory), visual tasks (visual search) of 32 eleven-year-old children with dyslexia were compared with those of 32 typical readers with the same chronological age and 32 reading-matched younger children. It was found that children with dyslexia scored lower than typical readers on phonological and prosodic perception tasks but not on rise perception tasks. It can thus be concluded that children with dyslexia in Spanish show a prosodic impairment that may originate from subtle auditory-processing deficits."

Language development has been characterised by significant individual stability from school entry. However, the extent to which trajectories of language growth vary in children with language disorder as a function of co-occurring developmental challenges is a question of theoretical import, with implications for service provision.

Methods
SCALES employed a population-based survey design with sample weighting procedures to estimate growth in core language skills over the first three years of school. A stratified sample (n = 529) received comprehensive assessment of language, nonverbal IQ, and social, emotional and behavioural difficulties at 5–6 years of age and 95% of the sample (n = 499) were assessed again at ages 7–8. Language growth was measured using both raw and standard scores in children with typical development, children with language disorder of unknown origin, and children with language disorders associated with a known clinical condition and/or intellectual disability.

Results
Overall, language was stable at the individual level (estimated ICC = 0.95) over the first three years of school. Linear mixed effects models highlighted steady growth in language raw scores across all three groups, including those with multiple developmental challenges. There was little evidence, however, that children with language disorders were narrowing the gap with peers (z-scores). Adjusted models indicated that while nonverbal ability, socioeconomic status and social, emotional and behavioural deficits predicted initial language score (intercept), none predicted language growth (slope).

Conclusions
These findings corroborate previous studies suggesting stable language trajectories after ages 5–6 years, but add considerably to previous work by demonstrating similar developmental patterns in children with additional nonverbal cognitive deficits, social, emotional, and behavioural challenges, social disadvantage or clinical diagnoses."

This research had two main goals. First, we aimed to develop a screening protocol for early identification of Brazilian children at risk for dyslexia; second, we aimed to identify the predictive variables of this protocol using Principal Component Analysis. The major step involved in developing this protocol was the selection of variables, which were chosen based on the literature review and linguistic criteria. The screening protocol was composed of seven cognitive-linguistic skills: Letter naming; Phonological Awareness (which comprises the following subtests: Rhyme production, Rhyme identification, Syllabic segmentation, Production of words from a given phoneme, Phonemic Synthesis, and Phonemic analysis); Phonological Working memory, Rapid naming Speed; Silent reading; Reading of words and nonwords; and Auditory Comprehension of sentences from pictures. A total of 149 children, aged from 6 years to 6 and 11, of both genders who were enrolled in the 1st grade of elementary public schools were submitted to the screening protocol. Principal Component Analysis revealed four factors, accounting for 64.45% of the variance of the Protocol variables: first factor (“pre-reading”), second factor (“decoding”), third factor (“Reading”), and fourth factor “Auditory processing”. The factors found corroborate those reported in the National and International literature and have been described as early signs of dyslexia and reading problems."

One hundred forty-seven students attending the third year of kindergarten in Jining, China, were assessed on nonverbal IQ, vocabulary breadth and depth, and their knowledge of book titles. Parents also participated in the study by filling out a questionnaire on the frequency of shared book reading and the number of children's books at home, recording their daily parent–child reading activities (diary), and completing the children's title and author recognition checklists. Results of exploratory factor analysis indicated that the measures of print exposure were loading on three interrelated factors. The items measuring the frequency of shared book reading at home along with diary formed one factor, the children's title recognition checklist and number of children's books at home formed a second factor, and children's knowledge of book titles formed a third factor. In addition, the results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that whereas all factors accounted for unique variance (3–6%) in vocabulary breadth, only children's knowledge of book titles predicted vocabulary depth, after controlling for children's age, parents’ education and income, and children's nonverbal IQ. Taken together, these findings suggest that different measures of print exposure may capture different aspects of print exposure and that these aspects may exert a different role in vocabulary breadth and depth."

Structural equation models showed that word reading and spelling development separately were highly stable and consistently autoregressive in nature during first and second grade. Both word reading and spelling development were predicted by early literacy, and word reading development was additionally predicted by rapid naming. An integrated model for word reading and spelling development showed that word reading skill predicted subsequent spelling skills in Grade 2 over and above the autoregressive prediction. No reciprocal relation of spelling to subsequent word reading has been found."

Data which were collected through semi-structured interviews, document analysis and observations were thematically analysed. Results of the study indicate that parents in King William’s Town, South Africa are not effectively involved in their children’s acquisition of literacy because the parents do not feel appropriately empowered to influence the development of their children’s literacy. The paper also found that shortage of literacy material like newspapers, magazines, story books, and computers militated against parental involvement.

In a first step, we examined the structure of rapid automatized naming (RAN) performance from a general cognitive perspective. We investigated whether rapid naming measures (e.g., digit RAN, color RAN) reflect a mainly domain-general factor or domain-specific factors. In a second step we examined how the best fitting RAN model was related to reading and arithmetic outcomes, assessed several months later. Finally in a third step we took a clinical perspective and investigated specific contributions of RAN measures to reading and arithmetic outcomes. While RAN has emerged as a promising predictor of reading, the relationship between RAN and arithmetic has been less examined in the past. Hundred and twenty-two first graders completed seven RAN tasks, each comprising visually familiar stimuli such as digits, vowels, consonants, dice, finger numeral configurations, objects and colors. Four months later the same children completed a range of reading and arithmetic tasks. From a general cognitive perspective, structural equation modeling supports a one-dimensional RAN factor in 6-to-7-year-old children. However, from a clinical perspective, our findings emphasize the specific contributions of RANs. Interestingly, alphanumeric RANs (i.e., vowel RAN) were most promising when predicting reading skills and number-specific RANs (i.e., finger numeral configuration RAN) were most promising when predicting arithmetic fluency. The implications for clinical and educational practices will be discussed."

The impact of these factors on the alphabet knowledge of students with significant cognitive disabilities is unknown. The purpose of this preliminary investigation was to explore the impact of three factors that might influence uppercase alphabet knowledge among students with significant cognitive disabilities: own name, letter order in the alphabet string, and letter frequency. Archival data documenting identification of each of the 26 uppercase letters of the alphabet for 131 8- to 21-year-old students were analyzed using a multilevel logistic regression model. While the use of extant data has limitations, results indicated that own-name advantage gave students a 10% greater likelihood of knowing the first letter of their own first name/nickname than any other alphabet letter. Letter-order analysis showed there were differences between letters found earlier in the alphabet string versus those that were found later in the alphabet string; however, the results were not statistically significant. Letter-frequency analysis did not reveal a significant impact of frequency on letter name knowledge in this sample. The findings provide preliminary evidence that at least some of the factors that influence alphabet knowledge in young children without disabilities also impact students with significant cognitive disabilities and point to the need for more research in this area."

Next, we examined the relation between these home practices and the development of writing skills in 4- and 5-year old preschool children. Correlations between parental teaching activities and child independent activities and letter writing, spelling, and spontaneous writing were statistically significant. Results from the multi-level modeling indicated that parental teaching predicted a child’s letter writing, spelling, and spontaneous writing skills whereas child independent practices predicted letter writing and spontaneous writing but not spelling.

This study investigated the interrelations of growth in LNF and LSF across the kindergarten year and their unique roles in predicting later reading fluency. Piecewise parallel-process growth models indicated that although LNF and LSF were highly correlated at kindergarten entry, fall LNF status was positively predictive of LSF growth across the fall. Bidirectional effects were present, as initial LSF was also a positive predictor of LNF growth across the fall; however, its effects were not as strong as those of initial LNF on LSF growth. More importantly, both initial status and growth in LNF and LSF were uniquely predictive of first-grade reading fluency, indicat..."

Recent studies indicate atypical structural and functional anomalies either in one hemisphere or both hemispheres, which might be accompanied by alterations in inter-hemispheric connectivity. Indeed, abnormalities of the corpus callosum – the main fiber tract connecting the two hemispheres – have been linked to speech and language deficits in associated disorders, such as stuttering, dyslexia, aphasia, etc. However, there is a dearth of studies examining the corpus callosum in SSD. Here, we investigated whether a sample of 18 children with SSD differed in callosal morphology from 18 typically developing children carefully matched for age. Significantly reduced dimensions of the corpus callosum, particularly in the callosal anterior third, were observed in children with SSD. These findings indicating pronounced callosal aberrations in SSD make an important contribution to an understudied field of research and may suggest that SSD is accompanied by atypical lateralization of speech and language function."

This study explored whether students’ performance on a simple rhythm task at school entry could serve as a predictor of whether they would face difficulties in word reading and spelling at the end of grade 1. The participants were 479 Norwegian 6-year-old first graders randomized as controls in the longitudinal RCT on track (n = 1171). Rhythmic timing and pre-reading skills were tested individually at school entry on a digital tablet. On the rhythm task, the students were told to tap a drum appearing on the screen to two different rhythms (2 Hz paced and 1.5 Hz paced). Children’s responses were recorded as they tapped on the screen with their index finger. Significant group differences were found in rhythm tapping ability measured at school entry, when groups were defined upon whether children went on to score above or below the 20th percentile reading and spelling thresholds in national assessment tests at the end of grade one. Inclusion of the school-entry rhythmic tapping measure into a model of classification accuracy for above or below threshold reading and spelling improved accuracy of classification by 6.2 and 9.2% respectively."

As a family’s reading history may not be available, a self-report of reading abilities is used to identify children’s background. In this paper, we explored the contribution of phonological, literacy, and linguistic abilities and reported parental reading abilities to predict reading achievement at the end of the school year in a Spanish sample. Children who were starting to read were assessed in a variety of oral language, phonological, and literacy tasks at the beginning and end of the school year. Parents filled out a self-report questionnaire about their reading abilities. Their answers were used to assign children to good or poor reader parent groups (GRP vs PRP). A logistic and ROC analysis were used to assess the variables’ discriminative capability, considering literacy scores at the end of the year as a measure of reading achievement. GRP children obtained higher scores than PRP children did. Performance on tasks of rapid naming assessment (RAN) letters (78.6%), Word Reading (75.7%), and Deletion (75.6%) were the most accurate predictors of children’s reading achievement. IPRA showed slightly lower accuracy (73.8) than did the behavioral measures and as high specificity as RAN letters (96.2%), similarly to the percentages found in previous studies. Although behavioral measures were shown as the best predictors, parents’ self-reports could also provide a quick estimation of family risk of difficulties in literacy acquisition."

The estimated group difference was greater when participation in summer school was distinguished from receipt of the summer program offer in analyses that explicitly adjusted for the proportion of students who failed to comply with their assignment. These results demonstrate that the nature and generalizability of the inference regarding program performance varies in relation to the intended and achieved design and the analytic model applied to data.

Morphological awareness tasks targeted the root and word pattern derivational system of Arabic, in both the oral and the written modalities. Phonological awareness employed a variety of orally administered segmentation and deletion tasks. The results demonstrated early deficits in morphological awareness, besides deficits in phonological awareness, in RD children as compared with typically developing controls, as well as in word and pseudoword spelling and reading (voweled and unvoweled). While phonological awareness emerged as the strongest predictor of reading, morphological awareness was also found to predict unique variance in reading, and even more so in spelling, beyond phonological awareness and cognitive skills. The results demonstrate the early emergence of morphological awareness deficits, alongside phonological deficits in Arabic RD, as well as the role of morphological processing in early reading and spelling. These findings reflect the centrality of derivational morphology in the structure of the spoken and the written Arabic word. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

One hundred and forty third-year kindergarten Chinese children (71 girls and 69 boys; mean age = 70.54 months) were assessed on nonverbal IQ, phonological awareness, vocabulary, and word reading. Parents also filled out a questionnaire on their educational level and income, the frequency of engaging in different home literacy-related activities with their child, and their expectations about their child’s reading/school performance. Results of path analysis showed that formal literacy activities predicted phonological awareness and literacy resources at home predicted vocabulary. In addition, family’s SES was a significant predictor of literacy resources at home and parents’ expectations was a significant predictor of all home literacy aspects and of word reading. Results of multiple mediation analysis further showed that the effects of parents’ expectations on word reading were partly mediated by formal literacy experiences and literacy resources at home. In contrast, the effects of literacy resources at home on word reading were fully mediated by the effects of vocabulary on phonological awareness. Taken together, these findings suggest that the links between home literacy environment (including the factors that shape the quantity and quality of the home literacy experiences) and reading in Chinese are not as straightforward as those previously reported in alphabetic languages."

Smith-Lock","Purpose: Numerous studies have reported a robust relationship between early phonological awareness (PA) and subsequent reading achievement, in addition to the critical role of the alphabetic principle in predicting and supporting later reading and spelling development. Given this association, there has been an increasing push to teach these skills to young children prior to word level reading and spelling instruction. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Cracking the Code (CtC) program with students aged 3;8–5;4. CtC is a teacher-implemented program, designed to explicitly target PA skills and alphabet knowledge. Method: A pre-test post-test group design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Four schools in metropolitan Western Australia were randomly assigned to either the control or experimental condition within a parallel groups design. The control group participated in an alternative program matched for duration and frequency, targeting semantics and grammar. Result: The children in the experimental condition improved significantly more in PA, alphabet knowledge and non-word reading, and spelling after intervention than the control group. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that classroom-based, teacher-delivered PA and alphabet knowledge instruction can be effective for 3;8–5;4 year-olds."

The aims of the present study were to examine (1) the growth trajectory of phonemic awareness in the kindergarten years; and (2) the unique contribution of initial levels and growth of phonemic awareness in L2 spelling, with other important cognitive-linguistic predictors statistically controlled. One hundred and forty-one Chinese ESL children were followed for one year during which their phonemic awareness was assessed four times, at three-monthly intervals. Spelling was assessed at Time 5, which was 12 months after the beginning of the study. Non-linear growth of phonemic awareness was observed. With age, non-verbal intelligence, letter name knowledge, vocabulary knowledge, syntactic awareness, word reading statistically controlled, both the initial levels and growth of phonemic awareness predicted L2 spelling at ..."

These differences are even wider for children in low-income families. This article aims to examine the extent to which home factors account for variation in early literacy outcomes in the first year of schooling. A total of 72 first graders and their parents from low-income families in Lusaka, Zambia, participated in the study. A self-reported home literacy questionnaire was used to collect home literacy data − parental education, home possessions, reading materials, language awareness, print experience, writing activities, reading activities and teaching letters. Children’s early literacy skills were assessed using four measures: orthography awareness, spelling, vocabulary and math tests. These tests were measured at two points: at the beginning and at the end of the first grade. Results showed that teaching letters was most predictive of literacy outcomes both at the beginning and end of the first year. The study concludes that formal teaching of letters at home is the parents’ greatest strength for supporting literacy in low-income families. Thus, energies for parental involvement should be directed in ways that are culturally practised and manageable by parents for better literacy outcomes."

The aim of the study was to examine whether the connection between phonemic awareness and literacy in Greek is constant over time even when appropriate controls are taken into account. I examined this hypothesis with Greek Cypriot children (N = 404) ages 6 to 10. Results showed that after an interval of 8 months and even after I controlled for the estimation of verbal ability and morphological awareness, phonemic awareness predicted children’s performance in reading. Phonemic awareness predicted spelling only after I controlled for the estimation of verbal ability. In terms of the need to establish more general theories about phonemic awareness and literacy, this study contributes the long-term relation between phonemic awareness and literacy in Greek. In practice, this study contributes valid measures for assessing phonemic and morphological awareness in Greek."

Martin, Sendy Caffarra, Sophie Schlöffel, Manuel Carreiras, Marie Lallier","The present study investigated whether orthographic depth can increase the bias towards multi-letter processing in two reading-related skills: visual attention span (VAS) and rapid automatized naming (RAN). VAS (i.e., the number of visual elements that can be processed at once in a multi-element array) was tested with a visual 1-back task and RAN was measured in a serial letter naming task that introduced a novel manipulation (some letter sequences formed frequent words). Spanish-Basque and French-Basque bilingual children were tested at early (30 children in 1st and 2nd grade), and more advanced (24 children in 3rd, 4th and 5th grade) stages of reading acquisition to investigate whether they would be differently biased towards multi-letter processing due to reading in two shallow (Spanish, Basque), or a deep and a shallow (French, Basque) orthography. The French-Basque bilinguals, who read in a deep orthography, were expected to rely on larger orthographic units in reading and thus to be more biased towards multi-letter processing in both tasks. This was expected to be reflected by: (a) a uniform distribution of attention across letter strings in the VAS task, and (b) a greater interference of the embedded words on letter-by-letter naming in RAN, leading to longer naming times. The expected group differences were observed in the more advanced readers, with French-Basque bilinguals showing a wider distribution of VAS across letter strings and longer naming times in RAN."

Pugh, Ludo Verhoeven","Research suggests that a phonological deficit primarily underlies developmental dyslexia. However, the existing evidence is mainly based on studies in children learning to read English. In recent years, the research base has broadened, as research around the world has provided new insights into the neural and cognitive foundations of developmental dyslexia in different languages. The present issue aims to bring together observations on reading disabilities across languages and writing systems within cross-linguistic and cross-writing system perspectives while taking into account a broad multidisciplinary scope. An attempt is made to advance theoretical models of developmental dyslexia through systematic analyses of reading disabilities in Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, German, Greek, and Spanish in perspective of universal and particular underlying cognitive principles. It is also discussed how within- and cross-language observations may affect the conceptualization of developmental dyslexia."

Recent studies have shown a strong link between the knowledge of letters at early ages and the decoding processes. Our study deepens into the learning process of the Spanish alphabet code, focused on the graphemes, and analyzes the predictive power of knowing of letters for the decoding abilities in initial reading. To this end, the research relies on a longitudinal prospective methodology and makes use of standardised instruments (PROLEC-R and BIL) applied to 362 students aged 4 and 5. The data obtained are analysed through multiple regression, using structural equation models. Our research outlines the relevance of learning the sequence of graphemes from early ages, differentiating the sequence of learning in Spanish with respect to English language. In Spanish, the learning sequence of the graphemes is independent of the learning sequence of phonemes. Moreover, this article emphasizes the importance of a learning sequence of these letters, in order to foresee the development of the decoding abilities. This study concludes that the early educational practices that take into account the letters name and phoneme, as well as the concrete sequence in graphemes learning, optimise the reading performance of Spanish speaking children."

We also discuss a number of challenges that face China’s rural school system. Design/methodology/approach W use secondary data on policies and trends over the past 40 years for preschool, primary/junior high school and high school. Findings The trends over the past 40 years in all areas of rural schooling have been continually upward and strong. While only a low share of rural children attended preschool in the 1980s, by 2014 more than 90 percent of rural children were attending. The biggest achievement in compulsory education is that the rise in the number of primary students that finish grade 6 and matriculate to junior high school. There also was a steep rise of those going to and completing high school. While the successes in upscaling rural education are absolutely unprecedented, there are still challenges.

Patel","Abstract A growing number of studies report links between nonlinguistic rhythmic abilities and certain linguistic abilities, particularly phonological skills. The current study investigated the relationship between nonlinguistic rhythmic processing, phonological abilities, and early literacy abilities in kindergarteners. A distinctive aspect of the current work was the exploration of whether processing of different types of rhythmic patterns is differentially related to kindergarteners’ phonological and reading-related abilities. Specifically, we examined the processing of metrical versus nonmetrical rhythmic patterns, that is, patterns capable of being subdivided into equal temporal intervals or not (Povel & Essens, 1985). This is an important comparison because most music involves metrical sequences, in which rhythm often has an underlying temporal grid of isochronous units. In contrast, nonmetrical sequences are arguably more typical to speech rhythm, which is temporally structured but does not involve an underlying grid of equal temporal units. A rhythm discrimination app with metrical and nonmetrical patterns was administered to 74 kindergarteners in conjunction with cognitive and preliteracy measures. Findings support a relationship among rhythm perception, phonological awareness, and letter-sound knowledge (an essential precursor of reading). A mediation analysis revealed that the association between rhythm perception and letter-sound knowledge is mediated through phonological awareness. Furthermore, metrical perception accounted for unique variance in letter-sound knowledge above all other language and cognitive measures. These results point to a unique role for temporal regularity processing in the association between musical rhythm and literacy in young children."

Three of these interventions concerned invented spelling, where the children tried to spell words. In the first condition, they were encouraged to reflect on conventional spellings. In the second condition, they reflected on spellings that were slightly more complex than theirs, while in the third condition, they reflected on increasingly complex spellings that eventually led to the conventional spellings. The fourth condition (control) consisted of phonological training. We assessed the children’s phonological awareness, letter knowledge, spelling, and decoding skills, controlling for vocabulary and nonverbal cognitive ability. Posttest results indicated progress in each condition. The greatest progress was observed in the second condition for decoding, spelling, letter-name knowledge and syllable awareness, and in the control condition for phoneme awareness. ..."

Its origin is still under debate. Studies usually focus on a singular cause for dyslexia; however, some researchers argue that dyslexia reflects multiple deficits. Two of the abilities under investigation in dyslexia are working memory (WM) and auditory temporal processing (ATP). In order to better evaluate the relative roles of WM and ATP in dyslexia, in the present study, we tested the contribution of WM and ATP to different types of reading performance and phonological awareness in dyslexia, using a multidimensional approach. Seventy-eight adults with dyslexia and 23 normal-reading adults performed WM and ATP tasks, as well as reading and phonological awareness tests. Readers with dyslexia showed poorer performance on all tests. Both WM and ATP were significant predictors of reading performance and phonological awareness among participants with dyslexia. Dividing participants with dyslexia according to their performance level on WM and ATP tasks revealed group differences in reading and phonological awareness tests. Both WM and ATP contribute to dyslexia, and varying levels of difficulties in both of these abilities are observed among this population. This is strong evidence in favor of the multi-deficit approach in dyslexia, and suggests that researchers should consider this approach in future studies of dyslexia."
