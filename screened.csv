The children (33 girls, 86 boys) ranged in age from 7.5 years to 12 years. Variables chosen for study included simple and complex phonological processing, speech rate, continuous naming speed, running memory span, serial memory span, and mental addition. Evidence is presented that the two poor reader groups are distinguishable. Unlike the dyslexic group, the slow/borderline group did not differ from the ADD group on three key measures: simple auditory phonological sensitivity, continuous naming speed, and running memory span. Stepwise regression to predict word list reading level showed that once age and verbal IQ were removed (51% of variance), these three key measures accounted for an additional 22% of the variance ..."

However, less attention has been given to the early predictors of later reading achievement. This study used a modified best-subsets variable-selection technique to examine kindergarten predictors of early versus later reading comprehension impairments. Participants included 433 children involved in a longitudinal study of language and reading development. The kindergarten test battery assessed various language skills in addition to phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, naming speed, and nonverbal cognitive ability. Reading comprehension was assessed in second and eighth grades. Results indicated that different combinations of variables were required to optimally predict second versus eighth grade reading impairments. Although some variables effectively predicted reading impairments in both grades, their relative contributions shift..."
START,START,1972409856,early preschool processing abilities predict subsequent reading outcomes in bilingual spanish catalan children with specific language impairment sli,2014,"eva aguilarmediavilla, lucia buillegaz, josep a perezcastello, eduard rigocarratala, daniel adroverroig",journal of communication disorders,1,15,68,"Abstract NA NA Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) have severe language difficulties without showing hearing impairments, cognitive deficits, neurological damage or socio-emotional deprivation. However, previous studies have shown that children with SLI show some cognitive and literacy problems. Our study analyses the relationship between preschool cognitive and linguistic abilities and the later development of reading abilities in Spanish–Catalan bilingual children with SLI. The sample consisted of 17 bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI and 17 age-matched controls. We tested eight distinct processes related to phonological, attention, and language processing at the age of 6 years and reading at 8 years of age. NA Results show that bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI show significantly lower scores, as compared to typically developing peers, in phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming (RAN), together with a lower outcome in tasks measuring sentence repetition and verbal fluency. Regarding attentional processes, bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI obtained lower scores in auditory attention, but not in visual attention. At the age of 8 years Spanish–Catalan children with SLI had lower scores than their age-matched controls in total reading score, letter identification (decoding), and in semantic task (comprehension). Regression analyses identified both phonological awareness and verbal fluency at the age of 6 years to be the best predictors of subsequent reading performance at the age of 8 years. Our data suggest that language acquisition problems and difficulties in reading acquisition in bilingual children with SLI might be related to the close interdependence between a limitation in cognitive processing and a deficit at the linguistic level. NA Learning Outcomes: After reading this article, readers will be able to: identify their understanding of the relation between language difficulties and reading outcomes; explain how processing abilities influence reading performance in bilingual Spanish-Catalan children with SLI; and recognize the relation between language and reading via a developmental model in which the phonological system is considered central for the development of decoding abilities and comprehension."
START,START,2128485164,who are the young children for whom best practices in reading are ineffective an experimental and longitudinal study,2006,"stephanie al otaiba, douglas fuchs",journal of learning disabilities,1,187,69,"The primary purpose of this study was to identify student characteristics that reliably predict responsiveness and nonresponsiveness to generally effective early literacy interventions. Participants were 104 children, including 7 with special needs and Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), who were tested in kindergarten and first grade. Responsiveness/nonresponsiveness status was determined after 2 years during which children participated in best practice instruction (a) in kindergarten and first grade, (b) in kindergarten only, (c) in first grade only, or (d) in neither year. This facilitated the study of three groups. Always responsive students met responsiveness criteria in both years. Sometimes responsive students met the criteria in only one year. Nonresponsive students did not meet the criteria in either year. Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant function analysis indicated that the three groups were reliably different from one another on measures of problem behavior, verbal memory, sentence imitation, syntactic awareness, vocabulary, naming speed, and segmentation. A combination of naming speed, vocabulary, sentence imitation, problem behavior, and amount of intervention correctly predicted 82.1% of nonresponsive students, 30.0% of sometimes responsive students, and 84.1% of always responsive students. Fifty students from kindergarten and first grade were tested again at the end of what should have been their third-grade year. All but 1 of the nonresponsive students who received intervention had been identified as requiring special education and had an IEP with reading goals."

In total, 113 Mandarin-speaking Chinese children, 100 Korean children, 112 English-speaking Canadian children, and 108 Greek children in Grade 3 were administered tasks of serial and discrete naming of words and digits. Interrelations among tasks indicated that the link between rapid naming and reading is largely determined by the format of the tasks across orthographies. Multigroup path analyses with discrete and serial word reading as dependent variables revealed commonalities as well as significant differences between writing systems. The path coefficient from discrete digits to discrete words was greater for the more transparent orthographies, consistent with more efficient sight-word processing. The effect of discrete word reading on serial word reading was stronger in alphabetic languages, where there was also a suppressive effect of discrete digit naming. However, the effect of serial digit naming on serial word reading did not differ among the four language groups. This pattern of relationships challenges a universal account of reading fluency acquisition while upholding a universal role of rapid serial naming, further distinguishing between multi-element interword and intraword processing."

Subjects performed two RAN tasks (letters and objects), and data were analyzed through a response time analysis. Our results demonstrated that impaired RAN performance in dyslexic readers mainly stem from enhanced inter-item pause times and not from difficulties at the level of post-access motor production (expressed as articulation rates). Moreover, inter-item pause times account for a significant proportion of variance in reading ability in addition to the effect of phonological awareness in the dyslexic group. This suggests that non-phonological factors may lie at the root of the association between RAN inter-item pauses and reading ability. In normal readers, RAN performance was associated with reading ability only at early ages (i.e. in the reading-matched controls), and again it was the RAN inter-item pause times that explain the association.

Methods: A group of dyslexic children were compared with a matched control group from the Brain Resource International Database on measures of cognition and brain function (EEG and coherence). Results: The dyslexic group showed increased slow activity (Delta and Theta) in the frontal and right temporal regions of the brain. Beta-1 was specifically increased at F7. EEG coherence was increased in the frontal, central and temporal regions for all frequency bands. There was a symmetric increase in coherence for the lower frequency bands (Delta and Theta) and a specific right-temporocentral increase in coherence for the higher frequency bands (Alpha and Beta). Significant correlations were observed between subtests such as Rapid Naming Letters, Articulation, Spelling and Phoneme Deletion and EEG coherence profiles. Discussion: The results support the double-deficit theory of dyslexia and demonstrate that the differences between the dyslexia and control group might reflect compensatory mechanisms. Integrative Significance: These findings point to a potential compensatory mechanism of brain function in dyslexia and helps to separate real dysfunction in dyslexia from acquired compensatory mechanisms."

In a nationally representative sample of 486 children in the third and fourth grades, we identified 171 children with reading difficulties: 20 (12%) were classified as having a phonological deficit, 31 (18%) as having a naming speed deficit, and 41 (24%) as having a double deficit. Differences between the subgroups extended to reading, cognitive, and linguistic processes beyond phonological and naming abilities. Children with a double deficit performed worse than those with a naming speed deficit but similar to those with a phonological deficit. Numerous unconfirmed theories led to an in-depth analysis of the nature of rapid automatized naming and its relation to orthographic processing. Surprisingly, our findings revealed that orthographic processing may be considered a novel and separate core deficit, suggesting a triple deficit in Arabic rather than a double deficit. The findings are discussed in light of the uniqueness and complexity of Arabic orthography and orthographic transparency in the Arabic language."

Older poor readers also had a control group of readingmatched younger subjects. The study provided no support for the concept of dyslexia at age 6 to 7 years. Among older participants there was support for the concept of dyslexia as a phonological deficit and of nondiscrepant garden-variety poor reading as a developmental lag.

START,START,1996861362,does a visual orthographic deficit contribute to reading disability,2005,nathlie a badian,annals of dyslexia,1,64,59,"In this study, visual-orthographic skills were defined as the ability to recognize whether letters and numerals are correctly oriented. Aims were to investigate whether visual-orthographic skills would contribute independent variance to reading, and whether children with a visual-orthographic deficit would be more impaired readers than similar children without this deficit. Participants were 207 children, aged 8 to 10 years, who attended school in a small suburban community. Because of the evidence that phonological awareness and naming speed are strongly related to reading, visual-orthographic skills were entered into hierarchical regression analyses following these variables. With age, verbal IQ, and verbal short-term memory also controlled, visual-orthographic skills accounted for significant independent variance in all reading measures. When children with a visual—orthographic deficit (29% of the sample) were compared with those without this deficit, they were significantly lower on all reading variables. At 8 to 10 years of age, reading progress of some children continues to be hampered by a problem in orthographic memory for the orientation of letters and numerals. Such children will require special attention, but their problems may be overlooked. As recommended by Willows and Terepocki (1993), there is need for further research on the phenomenon of letter reversals when they occur among children beyond first grade."
START,START,2013960249,anchoring in 4 to 6 year old children relates to predictors of reading,2012,"karen banai, rachel yifat",journal of experimental child psychology,1,8,35,"Abstract NA NA Previous studies suggest that anchoring, a short-term dynamic and implicit process that allows individuals to benefit from contextual information embedded in stimulus sequences, might be causally related to reading acquisition. Here we report findings from two experiments in which two previously untested predictions derived from this anchoring hypothesis were tested: (a) that anchoring facilitates rapid naming and phonological short-term memory in children prior to the onset of formal reading instruction and (b) that anchoring makes a unique contribution to performance in two early predictors of reading (letter knowledge and phonological awareness). In line with those predictions, naming times were faster and memory spans were longer under conditions that encouraged the use of anchoring processes than under conditions that afforded little anchoring. Furthermore, performance in the anchoring-affording condition predicted significant amounts of variance in phonological awareness and letter knowledge even after controlling for the contribution of the conditions that did not afford anchoring. Therefore, we suggest that anchoring might contribute to the development of reading-related processes during the preschool years independent of the development of specific reading-related skills such as phonological processing."

While most research has focused on the HTT polyGln-expansion protein, we demonstrate that four additional, novel, homopolymeric expansion proteins (polyAla, polySer, polyLeu, and polyCys) accumulate in HD human brains. These sense and antisense repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation proteins accumulate most abundantly in brain regions with neuronal loss, microglial activation and apoptosis, including caudate/putamen, white matter, and, in juvenile-onset cases, also the cerebellum. RAN protein accumulation and aggregation are length dependent, and individual RAN proteins are toxic to neural cells independent of RNA effects. These data suggest RAN proteins contribute to HD and that therapeutic strategies targeting both sense and antisense genes may be required for efficacy in HD patients. This is the first demonstration that RAN proteins are expressed across an expansion located in an open reading frame and suggests RAN translation may also contribute to other polyglutamine diseases."
START,START,2005208906,reading scripts that differ in orthographic transparency a within participant and language investigation of underlying skills,2014,"irit barkochva, zvia breznitz",journal of experimental child psychology,1,10,61,"Abstract NA NA Spelling–sound transparency varies across orthographies. This aspect was found to have implications for the strategy of reading, but whether reading of different orthographies also relies differently on cognitive skills is yet unclear. This question was examined mainly by cross-participant-and-language investigations in which orthographic variation is hard to isolate. This work examined this topic using a within-participant-and-language study design. Hebrew readers in Grades 3 and 4 were longitudinally tested because in these grades they are engaged in reading three forms of script, transcribing the same language and varying in spelling–sound relations, as they gradually progress from reading a transparent orthography to reading an opaque one. Phonological awareness explained a considerable amount of variance in accuracy in reading all forms of script across these two years. The relations of morphological awareness with accuracy in reading the three forms of script were similar; however, the results suggested that these may be associated with the course of transition. Phonological awareness and rapid naming were similarly related to fluency in reading all forms of script when equivalent proficiencies in reading of these scripts were achieved. At this stage, the relations of vocabulary with fluency in reading and comprehension of the transparent and opaque forms of script were also much alike. Phonological memory explained a modest, but significant, amount of variance in comprehension of the unpointed script alone. These results suggest that, apart from phonological memory, the cognitive skills tested in this study serve as a common cognitive infrastructure in reading orthographies varying in spelling–sound transparency."

Phonological processing consisted of two distinct but correlated latent abilities: phonological awareness and naming speed. Phonological awareness had strong relationships with expressive and receptive language and reading skills. Naming speed had moderate relationships with these variables. Results suggest that children with ID bring the same skills to the task of learning to read as children with typical development, highlighting the fact that phonologically based reading instruction should be considered a viable approach."

In addition, we did not find evidence supporting the hypothesis that cerebellar deficits are more prominent for poor readers with “specific” reading disabilities (i.e., with discrepancies relative to IQ) than for poor readers with reading scores consistent with IQ. In contrast, measures of phonological awareness, rapid naming, and vocabulary were strongly associated with responder status and academic outcomes.

One set demonstrates a powerful relationship between phonological processing and reading skills. Another set reveals a relationship between visual responses in the motion pathways and reading skills. It is widely assumed that these two findings are unrelated. We tested the hypothesis that phonological awareness is related to motion responsivity in children's MT+. We measured BOLD signals to drifting gratings as a function of contrast. Subjects were 35 children ages 7–12 years with a wide range of reading skills. Contrast responsivity in MT+, but not V1, was correlated with phonological awareness and to a lesser extent with two other measures of reading. No correlation was found between MT+ signals and rapid naming, age or general IQ measures.

The objective of this investigation was to assess the potential uniqueness of co-morbid ADHD + RD and extend existing findings to the Hebrew language.



Method:  A parallel group design with post-hoc analysis of group differences was employed comparing four groups of children (19 ADHD, 17 RD, 27 ADHD + RD, and 23 controls) on reading measures, attention and executive functions (EF) as well as functions of phonemic awareness and rapid naming. Forward stepwise regressions were run in order to delineate significant relationships between phonemic awareness, rapid naming, attention and EF with outcome variables of reading.



Results:  The co-morbid group shared the basic characteristic impairments in attention and executive functions with the pure ADHD group and in reading domain functions with the pure RD group. In addition, this group showed unique deficits in rapid naming and a more severe impairment in working memory. Forward stepwise regression pointed to associations between executive functions and word reading accuracy in children with ADHD, in contrast to associations between linguistic functions and word accuracy in non-ADHD.



Conclusion:  The combination of cognitive deficits in the subgroup of children with both ADHD and RD and the relationship between accuracy in word decoding and executive functions shown for the ADHD groups point to a distinct clinical profile of the co-morbid condition. Attention and EF should be considered in the diagnosis of RD and in the remediation protocol."

These children also performed more poorly in letter knowledge, word and nonword reading accuracy and speed, and spelling at each time point. Children at family risk of dyslexia who did not fulfil criteria for dyslexia, scored more poorly than low-risk controls on the literacy and phonological measures that required the most fine-grained phonological representations.

Phonological ability, speech perception and low-level auditory processing were assessed in a group of 5-year-old pre-school children at high-family risk for dyslexia, compared to a group of well-matched low-risk control children. Based on family risk status and first grade literacy achievement children were categorized in groups and pre-school data were retrospectively reanalyzed. On average, children showing both increased family risk and literacy-impairment at the end of first grade, presented significant pre-school deficits in phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, speech-in-noise perception and frequency modulation detection. The concurrent presence of these deficits before receiving any formal reading instruction, might suggest a causal relation with problematic literacy development. However, a closer inspection of the individual data indicates that the core of the literacy problem is situated at the level of higher-order phonological processing. Although auditory and speech perception problems are relatively over-represented in literacy-impaired subjects and might possibly aggravate the phonological and literacy problem, it is unlikely that they would be at the basis of these problems. At a neurobiological level, results are interpreted as evidence for dysfunctional processing along the auditory-to-articulation stream that is implied in phonological processing, in combination with a relatively intact or inconsistently impaired functioning of the auditory-to-meaning stream that subserves auditory processing and speech perception."

However, there is controversy about whether disabled readers have a speed deficit that is restricted to the identification of printed words, or if instead, they have a more general speed deficit in retrieving names of even single digits. To investigate this issue, poor and average readers (N = 43) in grade 2 were assessed on several indices of speed of digit and letter naming, using both continuous-list and discrete-trial methodologies. MANCOVA indicated clear effects of reader group on discrete-trial latencies, as well as an interaction between reader group and the speed with which to-be-named items were presented. A series of hierarchical regression analyses explored the amount of shared variance between various measures of digit naming speed and five indices of reading skill. Latency for word identification shares considerable variance with latency for digit naming, and, in general, accounts for the shared variance of naming speed and several other measures of reading skill.

The group with ID scored lower than the TD group on word recognition and phonological decoding, but similarly on orthographic processing and rapid automatized naming (RAN). Further, phonological decoding significantly mediated the relation between group membership and word recognition, whereas neither orthographic processing nor RAN did so. The group with ID also underperformed the TD group on phonological awareness and phonological memory, both of which significantly mediated the relation between group membership and phonological decoding. These data suggest that poor word recognition in youth with ID may be due largely to poor phonological decoding, which in turn may be due largely to poor phonological awareness and poor phonological memory. More focus on phonological skills in the classroom may help students with ID to develop better word recognition skills."

A naming speed deficit appeared, not as a single type, but in association with a phonological deficit (23.3%), a visual deficit (3.3%), or both (10%).

Twin pairs drawn from the Colorado Front Range (n = 676; 224 monozygotic pairs; 452 dizygotic pairs) between the ages of 8 and 16 (M = 11.11) were assessed on multiple measures of each cognitive and reading-related skill.

The covariance between the cognitive skills and reading-related skills was driven primarily by genetic influences. The cognitive skills also shared large amounts of genetic variance, as did the reading-related skills. The common cognitive genetic variance was highly correlated with the common reading genetic variance, suggesting that genetic influences involved in general cognitive processing are also important for reading ability.

Although previous studies suggest these cognitive constructs are important for reading, we analyze the constructs simultaneously to test whether each is a unique predictor. We used latent variables from 483 participants (ages 8 to 16) to portion each cognitive and reading construct into its unique and shared variance. In these models we address two specific issues: (a) given that our wide age range may span the theoretical transition from “learning to read” to “reading to learn,” we first test whether the relation between word reading and reading comprehension is stable across two age groups (ages 8 to 10 and 11 to 16); and (b) the main theoretical question of interest: whether what is shared and what is separable for word reading and reading comprehension are associated with individual differences in working memory, inhibition, and measures of processing and naming speed. The results indicated that: (a) the relation between word reading and reading comprehension is largely invariant across the age groups; (b) working memory and general processing speed, but not inhibition or the speeded naming of non-alphanumeric stimuli, are unique predictors of both word reading and comprehension, with working memory equally important for both reading abilities and processing speed more important for word reading.

We followed kindergarten students (n = 193) for one year, evaluating a range of relevant predictor skills in kindergarten, and a range of relevant achievement outcomes (core, fluency, complex) of reading and math in grade 1. Few predictors differentially predicted math versus reading with some exception (phonological awareness and rapid naming for reading; counting knowledge for math).

Journal of Educational Psychology, 91, 415–438) proposes that deficits in phonological processing and rapid automatized naming (RAN) are separable sources of reading dysfunction. Further, the double-deficit hypothesis predicts that the presence of deficits in both phonological processing and RAN have an additive negative influence on reading performance above and beyond that of a single deficit. The purpose of this study was to examine the additive nature of phonological awareness (PA)- and RAN-deficits on written language skill in children with reading disabilities (RD). Concurrent relationships between PA, RAN, and written language skills were examined in 476 children with RD, ranging in age from 8 to 18 years of age. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that PA and RAN skill have an additive effect on a majority of the reading and spelling measures. When participants were classified into three deficit subtypes based on the double-deficit model (i.e. phonological-, rate-, and double-deficit), comparisons across the subtypes confirmed that individuals with double-deficits performed below the single-deficit groups on both subtyping variables (RAN and PA) and all measures of written language. When the double- and single-deficit groups were matched on the subtyping variable (i.e. double- and rate-deficit groups matched on RAN and double- and phonological-deficit groups matched on PA) differences between the double- and rate-deficit groups remained in non-word reading, whereas differences between the double- and phonological-deficit groups remained in timed word recognition and reading comprehension. These results support an additive model in which RAN-deficits primarily affect tasks that require speeded/fluent response, and PA-deficits primarily affect tasks that emphasize phonological processing skill. Results are also presented that illustrate several statistical problems associated with the formation of deficit groups by dichotomizing the RAN and PA variables.

A total of 35 first graders read short story passages in English embedded with target words representative of words likely to be known orally but not orthographically. Words were manipulated for target word spelling and contextual support. According to the self-teaching model, words correctly decoded during reading should be correlated with subsequent orthographic learning. The results of this study confirmed this prediction. Self-teaching was evidenced through significantly higher proportions of correctly identified target words across context conditions. Regression analyses showed that individual differences were related to prior orthographic knowledge and predicted students’ degree and quality of orthographic learning after controlling for general decoding ability."

Each of the tasks indicated that orthographic learning had taken place because processing of target homophones (e.g., yait) was superior to that of their homophonic controls (e.g., yate). Consistent with the self-teaching hypothesis, we obtained a substantial correlation (r=.52) between orthographic learning and the number of target homophones correctly decoded during story reading. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that neither RAN tasks nor general cognitive ability predicted variance in orthographic learning once the number of target homophones correctly decoded during story reading had been partialed out. In contrast, a measure of orthographic knowledge predicted variance in orthographic learning once the number of targets correctly decoded had been partialed. The development of orthographic knowledge appears to be not entirely parasitic on decoding ability."

Children at high and low risk for dyslexia were followed and compared at four different moments: kindergarten and first, third and sixth grades. Three groups were then compared: (1) dyslexic readers; (2) normal readers at high risk for dyslexia; and (3) normal readers at low risk for dyslexia. Children diagnosed with dyslexia scored lower than high-risk normal readers on phonological awareness (PA), rapid automatized naming (RAN), verbal short-term memory and literacy skills. Normal readers at high risk scored between both groups, confirming that dyslexia is to be considered as a continuum rather than an all-or-none condition. Growth analyses showed that the three groups evolved similarly on all measures except for phoneme deletion and literacy measures.

Basic DeFries and Fulker (DF) multiple regression models for the analysis of selected twin data confirmed the heritable nature of phonological decoding, orthographic choice, DISCR, and rapid-naming composites. Bivariate DF models were employed to examine the extent to which deficits in the three reading-related measures covary genetically with rapid naming. Significant bivariate heritability estimates for each of the reading measures with the numbers and letters rapid-naming composite were also obtained. As expected, univariate sib-pair linkage analyses indicated the presence of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 6p21.3 for phonological decoding and orthographic choice deficits. Bivariate linkage analyses were then conducted to test the hypothesis that this QTL for reading difficulties is pleiotropic for slower performance on RN tasks. The results obtained from these analyses did not provide substantial evidence that the 6p QTL for reading difficulties has significant effects on rapid naming; however, larger samples would be required to test this hypothesis more rigorously."

In addition, a no-training control group and a serial addition training group were included. Various measures of SRN and of reading were administered to evaluate the effect of the training. Before the training, we found a symbol-specific relationship between SRN and reading: the relationship of reading with letter-sound naming was higher than its relationship with number naming.

We conclude that it might be difficult to quickly improve the serial rapid naming of letter sounds in beginning readers."

During reading acquisition children learn to recognize orthographic stimuli and link them to phonology and semantics. The present study investigated neurocognitive processes of learning to read after one year of schooling. We aimed to elucidate the cognitive processes underlying neural tuning for print that has been shown to play an important role for reading and dyslexia. A 128-channel EEG was recorded while 68 (Swiss-)German monolingual first grade children (mean age: 7.6) performed a one-back task with different types of letter and false-font strings. Print tuning was indexed by the N1 difference in the ERPs between German words and false-font strings, while the N1 lexicality effect was indexed by the difference between German words and pseudowords. In addition, we measured reading fluency, rapid automatized naming, phonological awareness, auditory memory span, and vocabulary. After one year of formal reading instruction N1 print tuning was clearly present at the group level, and could be detected at the individual level in almost 90% of the children. The N1 lexicality effect, however, could not be reliably found. On the cognitive level, next to word-reading fluency, vocabulary was also associated with N1 print tuning, but not measures reflecting phonological processing. These results demonstrate the presence of print tuning in the first year of reading acquisition and its development at the individual level. Moreover, individual differences in print tuning are not only related to word-reading fluency, but also to semantic knowledge, indicating that at early stages of learning to read the top-down modulation of print tuning is semantic rather than phonological in nature."

The dyslexics had specific deficits in word reading relative to the population mean and verbal IQ, but did not have primary language or motor deficits. Measurements of the posterior temporal lobe, inferior frontal gyrus, cerebellum and whole brain were collected from MRI scans. The dyslexics exhibited significantly smaller right anterior lobes of the cerebellum, pars triangularis bilaterally, and brain volume. Measures of the right cerebellar anterior lobe and the left and right pars triangularis correctly classified 72% of the dyslexic subjects (94% of whom had a rapid automatic naming deficit) and 88% of the controls. The cerebellar anterior lobe and pars triangularis made significant contributions to the classification of subjects after controlling for brain volume. Correlational analyses showed that these neuroanatomical measurements were also significantly correlated with reading, spelling and language measures related to dyslexia. Age was not related to any anatomical variable. Results for the dyslexic children from the family genetics study are discussed with reference to dyslexic adults from a prior study, who were ascertained on the basis of a discrepancy between phonological coding and reading comprehension. The volume of the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum distinguished dyslexic from control participants in both studies. The cerebellum is one of the most consistent locations for structural differences between dyslexic and control participants in imaging studies. This study may be the first to show that anomalies in a cerebellar-frontal circuit are associated with rapid automatic naming and the double-deficit subtype of dyslexia."

In the current study, this process was explored by setting preschool children’s (N = 242, mean age = 5.57 years) performance in the acquisition and retrieval of a paired associate learning (PAL) task in relation to their letter knowledge as well as to their performance in tasks assessing precursors of reading skills (i.e., phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, phonological short-term memory, backward recall, and response inhibition). Multiple regression analyses revealed that performance in the acquisition of the PAL task was significantly associated with phonological awareness and backward recall, whereas performance in the retrieval of the PAL task was significantly associated with rapid automatized naming, phonological awareness, and backward recall. Moreover, PAL proved to be mediating the relation between reading precursors and letter knowledge. Together, these findings indicate that the acquisition of letter knowledge may depend on a visual–verbal associative learning mechanism and that different factors contribute to the acquisition and retrieval of such visual–verbal associations."

However, reading by phonological decoding also requires rapid selection of sublexical orthographic units through serial attentional orienting, and recent studies have shown that visual spatial attention is impaired in dyslexic children. Our study investigated these different neurocognitive dysfunctions, before reading acquisition, in a sample of preschoolers including children with (N 520) and without (N 567) familial risk for developmental dyslexia. Children were tested on phonological skills, rapid automatized naming, and visual spatial attention. At-risk children presented deficits in both visual spatial attention and syllabic segmentation at the group level. Moreover, the combination of visual spatial attention and syllabic segmentation scores was more reliable than either single measure for the identification of at-risk children. These findings suggest that both visuo-attentional and perisylvian-auditory dysfunctions might adversely affect reading acquisition, and may offer a new approach for early identification and remediation of developmental dyslexia.

One hundred sixty (8–9 years) children attending two types of schools (Urdu and English medium schools) were distributed into two groups, a control and a reading disability group on the basis of teacher’s report. The results confirmed the role of RAN in predicting reading fluency in both groups. The role of NWR as a predictor of accuracy was also confirmed, although the strength of the relationship was modulated by RAN in the reading disability group. There are no tests available to identify children with reading problems in Urdu. Our study supports the validity of NWR and RAN tasks for the purposes of screening for reading deficits. The performance results also confirm the original grouping based on teacher reports.

While the predictors of reading performance in all alphabetic languages (studied so far) have been found to be relatively universal, the strength of the relationship can vary on the basis of script transparency (e.g. Caravolas et al., 2012; Vaessen, Bertrand, Toth, Csepe, & Faisca, 2010; Ziegler et al., 2010). In this study, we tested for the first time to what extent the depth of Urdu orthography impacts on reading performance in children aged 8–9 years, and whether tasks, such as non-word repetition (NWR) and rapid automatized naming (RAN), can tap reading skills in that age group, both for typical readers and children with a reading deficit (RD).

Urdu has an opaque and complex orthographic system. It is spoken worldwide (Schmidt, 2003) by a large number of people, yet it is underdescribed. Some characteristics of Urdu, which make it difficult to read, are the absence of vowel letters and the omission of diacritics in its script (Rao, Vaid, Srinivasan, & Chen, 2010). Furthermore, the Urdu graphemic system is cursive in nature (Mirdehghan, 2010) and characterized by many to one mappings between graphic symbols and sound (Rao et al., 2010). Although Urdu has vowel letter and diacritic omissions, very much like Hebrew, there are differences, and its cursive property makes it more difficult to read.

The Pakistani literacy situation is characterized by multilingualism, in that, whereas Urdu is the national standard language, most readers have another first language. The children who participated in this study are representative of this situation. The first language of the children is Punjabi, but when they enter school and start formal literacy instruction, they have to confront two new languages, Urdu and English, both with opaque, but completely different orthographies and using different alphabetic systems. Whereas for the majority of the students, both of these languages are new; for some of them (those from high socio-economic status families), Urdu might be another L1, in addition to Punjabi. Punjabi is rarely written or taught in schools (whether as a medium of instruction or as a subject) until graduate level1.

We used a battery of tasks documented in recent research to predict reading performance (e.g. Kirby, Parrila, & Pfeiffer, 2003). Such tasks have also been found suitable for screening for RDs (dyslexia) (e.g. Adams, 1990; Cutting & Denkla, 2001; National Reading Panel, 2000; Wimmer, Mayringer, & Landerl, 2000; Wolf, Bowers, & Biddle, 2000). The first task was NWR, and the second task comprised the four standard subtests used to test RAN, colour naming, object naming, digit naming and letter naming.

Phonological measures and RAN, as a measure of naming speed, have been reported to predict contrasting aspects of reading (e.g. Bowers, 1993; Spring & Davis, 1988; Young & Bowers, 1995). RAN is more closely associated with reading fluency; whereas phonological measures are linked to accuracy and comprehension. In addition, there is evidence of a predictive role of RAN in reading accuracy, as well as reading fluency (e.g. Savage & Frederickson, 2005). The strength of prediction of phonological tasks and RAN tasks has also been shown to vary in regard to the depth of language orthography (Vaessen et al., 2010)."
START,START,1968083361,neuropsychological predictors of academic underachievement in pediatric epilepsy moderating roles of demographic seizure and psychosocial variables,2004,"philip s fastenau, jianzhao shen, david w dunn, susan m perkins, bruce p hermann, joan k austin",epilepsia,1,134,53,"Children with epilepsy are at great risk for academic difficulties (1–7) and for underemployment as adults (6,8). Fastenau et al. (9) described a model to explain how various risk factors might contribute to academic problems. In that model, neuropsychological functioning appears to play an integral role, possibly mediating the effects of structural and electrophysiologic abnormalities (10–14). Other risk factors in the model include seizure, demographic, and psychosocial variables (9).

Studies to date have not been consistent in identifying seizure variables (e.g., seizure type, age at onset, seizure severity) that might influence the relation between neuropsychological functioning and academic achievement in children with epilepsy. For example, some studies have shown academic underachievement to be associated with absence epilepsy more so than with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (15), and children with generalized seizures demonstrated worse outcomes than did those with partial seizures (5,16,17). Still, others found no association between seizure type and academic achievement (4,18,19), and no studies of academic achievement examined the interaction between seizure type and neuropsychological functioning.

An early age at onset for seizures was associated with worse cognitive function in many studies (e.g., 5,20–22); yet others failed to find a relation (18,23). Persistent seizures and greater seizure severity also have been associated with greater academic underachievement in children (1,15), but others have failed to find a relation between seizure severity and achievement (e.g., 4). The lack of consistency in this literature suggests a need for further evaluation of seizure variables in academic functioning, particularly as they might interact with other variables (i.e., moderate other relations).

In addition to seizure variables, demographic and psychosocial variables might serve as moderators in the relation between neuropsychological functioning and academic achievement. Past studies suggest that gender, family environment, and children’s perceptions influence academic achievement in children with epilepsy. With regard to gender, a study of children with epilepsy found males to be more at risk for academic underachievement than females (1). In contrast, Howe et al. (24) found male adolescents, including those with neurologic conditions, had higher achievement scores than did adolescent females. In addition, low stimulation and support in the family environment were related to poorer academic achievement in children with seizures (4). Negative child attitudes and perceptions have been associated with poorer academic performance in children with epilepsy (1). Negative attributions have been observed in epilepsy for both adults (25) and teens (26), and such attributions have been associated with poor academic achievement in school-age children (27). Despite the support for the roles of these psychosocial factors on classroom success, no studies have examined the extent to which psychosocial variables might interact with neuropsychological functioning to influence academic achievement in this population.

Past studies focusing on seizure and psychosocial predictors of achievement in childhood epilepsy have been limited in several ways. They tended to rely on group tests of achievement or parent report or both, rather than using well-validated individual achievement tests (e.g., 1). In addition, neuropsychological functioning in many of those studies was assessed with limited measures, or a large battery of tests was used with no attempt to reduce the data into fewer and more relevant constructs (e.g., 28). We identified only one study of neuropsychology and academic achievement with this population that included a factor analysis to reduce the test battery into fewer, more salient neuropsychological constructs (29). Most important, no study to date has modeled the complex moderating roles of demographic, seizure, and psychosocial variables on the relation between neuropsychological functioning and academic achievement.

The present study builds on past studies by (1) recruiting a large sample of school-age children with diverse seizure types, (2) using a more comprehensive battery of neuropsychological and achievement tests, (3) exploring the factor structure of that battery, (4) modeling the relative contributions of each of these cognitive deficits to specific outcomes in each major academic domain, and (5) testing whether demographic, seizure, and psychosocial variables serve as moderators of the relation between neuropsychological functioning and academic achievement."

Patients and Methods: Twenty children diagnosed with dyslexia, aged 8–14 years, were included in this study. Group I (GI) was composed of 10 children who took part in the program, and group II (GII) consisted of 10 subjects who did not take the remediation. The pre-testing evaluated phonological awareness, rapid naming, working memory, reading and writing of words and nonwords, thematic writing, and auditory evoked potential – P300. The type of stimulus used was the speech (20% of rare stimulus and 80% of frequent stimulus), intensity of 80 dBNa. The rare stimulus was the syllable /da/, and the frequent stimulus was the syllable /ba/. Next, the Phonological Reading and Writing Remediation Program was applied in 24 cumulative sessions, twice a week, each with a duration of 30 min. In the post-testing (at the end of the program), all the tests of the pre-testing were reapplied. Results: There was a statistically significant difference (between pre- and post-testing) in phonological awareness, rapid naming, working memory, thematic writing, writing and reading words and nonwords, as well as in the latency of the P3 component of P300 in GI, while GII maintained the same difficulties. Conclusion: The phonological remediation program showed to be a therapeutic method of fast beneficial effects in written language of individuals with dyslexia. However, the wide age range and the size of the sample could be considered a limitation of this study – it interferes with the generalization of results."

They constituted two groups - bilingual group: 30 Brazilian children whose mother tongue and language spoken at home was Brazilian Portuguese and who were daily exposed to English at school for a period not shorter than three years; monolingual group: 30 students, from a monolingual Brazilian elementary school, who were paired by gender, age, and grade level with the bilingual students. Foreign children, children with complaint or indication of speech and language disorder, or who had been retained were excluded. A rapid automatized naming, pseudoword repetition, and oral reading tests were administered. The bilingual children were assessed in both languages and their performances were compared among themselves and with the monolingual group, which was only assessed in Brazilian Portuguese.RESULTS: The bilingual group showed better performance in English, rapid naming, and pseudoword repetition tasks, whereas Brazilian Portuguese, in reading fluency. A higher number of correlations were found in Brazilian Portuguese.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the acquisition of a second language may positively influence the abilities of rapid naming, reading rate, and accuracy. Brazilian bilingual students performed better in tasks of phonological memory in English and Brazilian Portuguese performed better in reading fluency. Different correlation patterns were found between the rapid naming, accuracy, and reading rate, in the bilingual group analysis, in both languages."

However, there was no overlap in domain-general direct effects on calculations (attentive behavior, reasoning, working memory) versus word reading (language, phonological memory, RAN).

The results indicated that all three WM components predicted word problem solving in the nonmediated model, but only the storage component of WM yielded a significant direct path to word problem-solving accuracy in the fully mediated model. Fluid intelligence was found to moderate the relationship between WM and word problem solving, whereas reading, calculation, and related skills (naming speed, domain-specific knowledge) completely mediated the influence of the executive system on problem-solving accuracy. Our results are consistent with findings suggesting that storage eliminates the predictive contribution of executive WM to various measures Colom, Rebollo, Abad, & Shih (Memory & Cognition, 34: 158-171, 2006).

Second, phonological awareness predicted spelling difficulties similarly across orthographies. Third, preschool and kindergarten RAN was a significant predictor of reading and spelling difficulties at both Grades 1 and 2 across orthographies.

Measures of text reading fluency, sentence reading fluency, and text comprehension were administered to the children in Grades 3 and 4 to assess their reading development over time. The results indicate that children's immediate response to repeated reading can contribute to the prediction of their development of reading fluency over time.

One version of this dynamic test was administered to 158 kindergarten children before the onset of formal reading instruction along with traditional predictors of reading. Similarly, a parallel version of the dynamic test was administered to the same children after a few months of formal reading instruction. At the end of grade 2, the children were assessed on outcome measures of reading and categorized as having disabilities with either accuracy or fluency measures. Administered before as well as after the onset of formal reading instruction, the dynamic test of decoding contributed uniquely to the prediction of difficulties with reading accuracy at the end of grade 2 after control for traditional predictors of reading. Difficulties with reading fluency were also predicted by the dynamic decoding test, but the unique prediction value was more limited. This study showed that a dynamic assessment of decoding can be a useful addition to traditional test batteries for early identification of children at risk for reading disabilities. Even when taken before formal reading instruction, a combination of the dynamic assessment and two traditional measures (letter knowledge and rapid automatized naming) yielded a very high prediction accuracy of reading difficulties at the end of grade 2."

In total, 304 Grade 4 children (102 Chinese-speaking Taiwanese children, 117 English-speaking Canadian children, and 85 Finnish-speaking children) were assessed on measures of RAN, speed of processing, phonological processing, orthographic processing, reading fluency, and spelling. The results of path analysis indicated that RAN had a strong direct effect on reading fluency that was of the same size across languages and that only in English was a small proportion of its predictive variance mediated by orthographic processing. In contrast, RAN did not exert a significant direct effect on spelling, and a substantial proportion of its predictive variance was mediated by phonological processing (in Chinese and Finnish) and orthographic processing (in English). Given that RAN predicted reading fluency equally well across languages and that phonological/orthographic processing had very little to do with this relationship, we argue that the reason why RAN is related to reading fluency should be sought in domain-general factors such as serial processing and articulation."

However, it remains unclear whether it also predicts word reading in Chinese, which is known for its ambiguous print–sound correspondences, and whether its effects are direct or indirect through the effects of other reading-related skills such as phonological awareness and rapid naming. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the direct and indirect effects of visual–verbal PAL on word reading in an unselected sample of Chinese children followed from the second to the third kindergarten year. A sample of 141 second-year kindergarten children (71 girls and 70 boys; mean age = 58.99 months, SD = 3.17) were followed for a year and were assessed at both times on measures of visual–verbal PAL, rapid naming, and phonological awareness.

The results of path analysis showed that visual–verbal PAL exerted a significant direct effect on word reading that was independent of the effects of phonological awareness and rapid naming. However, it also exerted significant indirect effects through phonological awareness.

Two cohorts of Grade 1 ESL and EL1 primary-level children were followed for two consecutive years. Results indicated that vocabulary knowledge, a measure of language proficiency, and nonverbal intelligence were not significant predictors of word recognition in either group. Yet, by considering individual differences in phonological awareness and rapid naming, it was possible to predict substantial amounts of variance on word recognition performance six months and one year later in both language groups. Commonality analyses indicated that phonological awareness and rapid naming contributed unique variance to word recognition performance. Moreover, the profiles of not at-risk children in the EL1 and ESL groups were similar on all but the oral language measure, where EL1 children had the advantage. In addition, EL1 and ESL profiles of children who had word-recognition difficulty were similar, with low performance on rapid naming and phonological awareness. Results indicate that these measures are reliable indicators of potential reading disability among ESL children."

DD is characterized by deficits in different cognitive skills, including word reading, spelling, rapid naming, and phonology. To investigate the genetic basis of DD, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of these skills within one of the largest studies available, including nine cohorts of reading-impaired and typically developing children of European ancestry (N = 2562–3468). We observed a genome-wide significant effect (p < 1 × 10−8) on rapid automatized naming of letters (RANlet) for variants on 18q12.2, within MIR924HG (micro-RNA 924 host gene; rs17663182 p = 4.73 × 10−9), and a suggestive association on 8q12.3 within NKAIN3 (encoding a cation transporter; rs16928927, p = 2.25 × 10−8). rs17663182 (18q12.2) also showed genome-wide significant multivariate associations with RAN measures (p = 1.15 × 10−8) and with all the cognitive traits tested (p = 3.07 × 10−8), suggesting (relational) pleiotropic effects of this variant. A polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis revealed significant genetic overlaps of some of the DD-related traits with educational attainment (EDUyears) and ADHD. Reading and spelling abilities were positively associated with EDUyears (p ~ [10−5–10−7]) and negatively associated with ADHD PRS (p ~ [10−8−10−17]). This corroborates a long-standing hypothesis on the partly shared genetic etiology of DD and ADHD, at the genome-wide level.

As a family’s reading history may not be available, a self-report of reading abilities is used to identify children’s background. In this paper, we explored the contribution of phonological, literacy, and linguistic abilities and reported parental reading abilities to predict reading achievement at the end of the school year in a Spanish sample. Children who were starting to read were assessed in a variety of oral language, phonological, and literacy tasks at the beginning and end of the school year. Parents filled out a self-report questionnaire about their reading abilities. Their answers were used to assign children to good or poor reader parent groups (GRP vs PRP). A logistic and ROC analysis were used to assess the variables’ discriminative capability, considering literacy scores at the end of the year as a measure of reading achievement. GRP children obtained higher scores than PRP children did. Performance on tasks of rapid naming assessment (RAN) letters (78.6%), Word Reading (75.7%), and Deletion (75.6%) were the most accurate predictors of children’s reading achievement. IPRA showed slightly lower accuracy (73.8) than did the behavioral measures and as high specificity as RAN letters (96.2%), similarly to the percentages found in previous studies. Although behavioral measures were shown as the best predictors, parents’ self-reports could also provide a quick estimation of family risk of difficulties in literacy acquisition."

Follow-up after an emergency department (ED) visit is important for continuity of care but is difficult to achieve. We conducted this study to determine whether e-mail could become a method for a follow-up contact after leaving the pediatric ED. METHODS: Over a 2-month period, parents who had a telephone line and e-mail access and whose child was discharged from the ED at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto were randomized to receive an e-mail or a telephone follow-up. Main outcome measure was the response rates by parents to the telephone or e-mail. RESULTS: A total of 265 (79%) of the 337 families who were approached had Internet access, and the majority (75%) check e-mails at least once a day. Eighty-seven percent (85 of 98) and 53% (53 of 100) of the families who were contacted by telephone or e-mail, respectively, were reached within an average of 17 and 46 hours, respectively. Fourteen percent of families from the study population were unreachable either by telephone or by e-mail. Most (57%) parents who did not respond to the e-mail did not check or did not remember reading the e-mail or had trouble with access. Ten percent of the e-mails were undeliverable. CONCLUSIONS: The telephone is better than e-mail as a follow-up channel with families of children who visit the pediatric ED. The main reason for not responding to e-mails is ""technical problems.""

The eight multiplex families ( N =171) presented in this study were ascertained from a sample of adult probands whose childhood reading history is well documented through archival information. Six phenotypes were constructed to span a range of dyslexia-related cognitive processes. These phenotypes were (1) phonemic awareness (of spoken words); (2) phonological decoding (of printed nonwords); (3) rapid automatized naming (of colored squares or object drawings); (4) single-word reading (orally, of printed real words); (5) vocabulary; and (6) spelling (of dictated words). In addition, the diagnosis of lifelong dyslexia was established by clinical means. Genotyping was done with nine highly polymorphic markers from the 6p22.3–6p21.3 region.

In addition, a lifetime diagnosis of dyslexia was used as a phenotype. Both parametric and non-parametric genetic analyses were completed. The results supported the importance of a putative locus on 1p. In addition, two-locus analyses assuming the interaction between a 1p locus and a 6p locus, previously shown to be of interest for dyslexia, were conducted. As a result, the non-parametric linkage (NPL) scores for rapid automatized naming and phonological decoding were significantly increased. In particular, the NPL scores for rapid automatized naming exceeded 5.0 for certain markers. These results provide strong evidence for separate but jointly acting contributions of the 1p and 6p loci to the reading impairments associated with rapid naming and suggestive evidence for a similar mechanism involving phonological decoding."

Methods: We conducted a prospective, double-blind, placebocontrolled, randomized, 2-week crossover trial of MPH, during which response to MPH was assessed. Learning ability was appraised using the Wide Range Achievement Test, Revised (WRAT-R), for English-speaking students and the Test de rendement pour francophones for French-speaking students. The study was conducted at the Douglas Hospital, a McGill University–affiliated teaching hospital in Montreal. Ninety-five children, aged 6–12 years, who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSMIV), criteria for ADHD participated in the study, which ran from 2001 to 2004. The outcome measure used was the Consensus Clinical Response, an indicator of the degree of clinical improvement shown when taking MPH. Results: The proportion of children with learning disabilities who responded to MPH (55%) was significantly smaller (χ 2 1 = 4.5, p = 0.034) than the proportion of children without learning disabilities who responded adequately to MPH (75%). This difference was mainly because of children with mathematics disability being particularly unresponsive to MPH (χ 2 1 = 4.5, p = 0.034). Children with reading disability did not show this pattern of poor response (χ 2 1 = 1.0, p = 0.33). Conclusion: Children with ADHD and comorbid learning disability tended to respond more poorly to MPH. In particular, children with disability in mathematics responded less to MPH than those without disability in mathematics. Additional therapy may be indicated for this group of patients."

The present study examined 37 children between the ages of 5 and 6, 11 of which had multiple risk factors for developing reading problems. The children participated in a passive oddball EEG experiment with sinusoidal sounds with changes in sound frequency, duration, or intensity. The responses to the standard stimuli showed a negative voltage shift in children at risk for reading problems compared to control children at 107–215 ms in frontocentral areas corresponding to P1 offset and N250 onset. Source analyses showed that the difference originated from the left and right auditory cortices. Additionally, the children at risk for reading problems had a larger late discriminative negativity (LDN) response in amplitude for sound frequency change than the control children. The amplitudes at the P1–N250 time window showed correlations to letter knowledge and phonological identification whereas the amplitudes at the LDN time window correlated with verbal short-term memory and rapid naming. These results support the view that problems in basic auditory processing abilities precede the onset of reading instruction and can act as one of the risk factors for dyslexia."

Visuo-spatial recall and RAN appeared as early precursors of L1 literacy, while phonological awareness appeared as early precursor of L2 English. Verbal long term memory was associated with both L1 and L2 skills in the Literacy stage. Significant group differences seen in the Pre-literacy and Emergent literacy stages decreased in the Literacy stage.



The developmental variations by stage and domain may explain some of the inconsistencies seen in dyslexia research. Early identification and training are essential to avoid academic failure, and our data show that visuo-spatial memory and RAN could be suitable early markers in transparent orthographies like Norwegian. Phonological awareness was here seen as an early precursor of L2 English, but not of L1 Norwegian. © 2015 The Authors. Dyslexia published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Research has shown that DL responses in dyslexia deviate from the typical pattern. Here, effects of DL training and its correspondence to rapid naming (RAN) and digit span (DS) in typical children and children with dyslexia were assessed. Three groups of third graders participated: two training groups, control training (CT) and dyslexia training (DT), and a control group that received no training (control no training, CnT). All took part in testing pretraining and posttraining. DL measures were on laterality, response scores, and attention. The three groups showed different response patterns: minor changes in CnT, change in all measures in CT, and some changes in DT. RAN and DS scores correlated significantly with some of the DL measures, especially with the attention scores. Our findings support arguments that brain architecture for language in dyslexia is lateralised in the same way as in children without dyslexia. However, the ability to modulate attention during DL is weaker in dyslexia than in typically developing children. A training‐induced normalisation of lateralisation was observed in free recall in the dyslexia group, which suggests that DL training may be a promising intervention approach."

One hundred and forty-seven Chinese primary school children with developmental dyslexia were tested on a number of literacy and cognitive tasks. The results showed that rapid naming deficit and orthographic deficit were the two most dominant types of cognitive deficits in Chinese developmental dyslexia, and that rapid naming and orthographic processing had significant unique contributions to literacy performance. Seven subtypes of dyslexia – global deficit, orthographic deficit, phonological memory deficit, mild difficulty, and three other subtypes with rapid-naming-related deficits – were identified using scores of the cognitive tasks as classification measures in cluster analyses. These subtypes were validated with a behaviour checklist and three literacy measures. The authors suggested that orthographic and rapid naming deficits in Chinese dyslexic children might pose an interrelated problem in developing orthographic knowledge and representation. Therefore, orthographic-related difficulties may be the crux of the problem in Chinese developmental dyslexia."

The parents were also given a behaviour checklist for identifying child at-risk behaviours. Results showed that the High Risk (Poor Reading) group performed significantly worse than the Low Risk and the High Risk (Good Reading) group on most of the measures and domains. More children in the High Risk (Poor Reading) group displayed at-risk behaviours than in the other two groups. These results suggest that Chinese at-risk children with early difficulties in reading and spelling do show a wide range of language-, phonology-, and print-related deficits, similar to their alphabetic counterparts.

Word decoding ability is a critical factor in reading performance. In the present study, we examined the relationship between word decoding ability and three different phonological skills; phonemic awareness, verbal short-term memory (V-STM), and rapid automatic naming (RAN) in 1007 Scandinavian third- and fifth-graders. In the first part of the study, we sought to investigate the influence of the three phonological skills on word decoding ability. Using multiple regression analysis, our result clearly demonstrated that phonemic awareness was the most powerful phonological skill explaining variance in word decoding ability among average decoders. Among children with poor decoding skills, however, RAN was the most important factor in Grade 3, whereas V-STM was the main contributor to decoding ability among children in Grade 5. In the second part of the research, we examined the relationship between poor phonological skills and word decoding ability. Interestingly, our result revealed that approximately one half of the children with phonological difficulties, still performed within the average range with regard to word decoding ability. However, our analyses confirmed earlier research concerning the severe word decoding difficulties children with both poor phonemic awareness and restricted V-STM, experience."

Little is known about the prevalence of refractive error, binocular vision, and other visual conditions in Australian Indigenous children. This is important given the association of these visual conditions with reduced reading performance in the wider population, which may also contribute to the suboptimal reading performance reported in this population. The aim of this study was to develop a visual profile of Queensland Indigenous children.

Methods

Vision testing was performed on 595 primary schoolchildren in Queensland, Australia. Vision parameters measured included visual acuity, refractive error, color vision, nearpoint of convergence, horizontal heterophoria, fusional vergence range, accommodative facility, AC/A ratio, visual motor integration, and rapid automatized naming. Near heterophoria, nearpoint of convergence, and near fusional vergence range were used to classify convergence insufficiency (CI).

Results

Although refractive error (Indigenous, 10%; non-Indigenous, 16%; p = 0.04) and strabismus (Indigenous, 0%; non-Indigenous, 3%; p = 0.03) were significantly less common in Indigenous children, CI was twice as prevalent (Indigenous, 10%; non-Indigenous, 5%; p = 0.04). Reduced visual information processing skills were more common in Indigenous children (reduced visual motor integration [Indigenous, 28%; non-Indigenous, 16%; p < 0.01] and slower rapid automatized naming [Indigenous, 67%; non-Indigenous, 59%; p = 0.04]). The prevalence of visual impairment (reduced visual acuity) and color vision deficiency was similar between groups.

Conclusions

Indigenous children have less refractive error and strabismus than their non-Indigenous peers. However, CI and reduced visual information processing skills were more common in this group. Given that vision screenings primarily target visual acuity assessment and strabismus detection, this is an important finding as many Indigenous children with CI and reduced visual information processing may be missed.

A computer-based sound–symbol paradigm (SSP) was administered to 243 children during their last year of kindergarten (T1), and their reading performance was assessed 1 year later in first grade (T2). Results showed that performance on the SSP measured before formal reading instruction was associated with later reading development. At T1, early readers performed significantly better than nonreaders in learning correspondences between sounds and symbols as well as in applying those correspondences in a serial manner. At T2, SSP performance measured at T1 was positively associated with reading performance. Importantly, serial application of newly learned correspondences at T1 explained unique variance in first-grade reading performance in nonreaders over and above other verbal predictors, including phonological awareness, verbal short-term memory, and rapid automatized naming. Consequently, the SSP provides a promising way to study aspects of reading in preliterate children."

We ran Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses to obtain regions of reliable activity across all the studies. The results indicate that, unlike results usually reported for adults, children primarily engage the frontal cortex when solving numerical tasks. With age, there may be a shift from reliance on the frontal cortex to reliance on the parietal cortex. In contrast, the frontal, temporo-parietal and occipito-temporal regions at work during reading in children are very similar to those reported in adults.

Sixteen typically developing children (5-15 years old, 8 male, mean age of sample=10.06 ±3.29) received two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, (mean inter-scan interval =2.19 years), and were administered a battery of cognitive measures. Volume changes between time points in five bilateral cortical regions of interest were measured, and assessed for relationships to three measures of reading. Better baseline performances on measures of word reading, fluency and rapid naming, independent of age and total cortical gray matter volume change, were associated with volume decrease in the left inferior parietal cortex. Better baseline performance on a rapid naming measure was associated with volume decrease in the left inferior frontal region. These results suggest that children who are better readers, and who perhaps read more than less skilled readers, exhibit different development trajectories in brain reading regions.

To identify subphenotypes amenable to model-based linkage analyses, we have used careful language phenotyping, familial aggregation analyses of single phenotype measures, and segregation analyses. In the current study, to identify covariates to use in future segregation analyses we examined six pairs of related measures selected from among the most promising candidates in the initial aggregation analyses whose aggregation patterns were most consistent with a genetic basis. For these reciprocal aggregation analyses each measure is evaluated with the paired measure as the covariate to obtain information about the interdependence of the paired measures on shared genetic factors. Six pairs of measures were evaluated: 1) accuracy and efficiency of phonological decoding; 2) phonological nonword memory and written spelling; 3) phonological decoding accuracy and written spelling; 4) inattention ratings and rapid automatized naming for switching letters and numerals (RAS); 5) inattention ratings and oral reading rate; and 6) RAS and oral reading rate. Results of these analyses provide evidence that there may be a genetic contribution to efficiency of phonological decoding in addition to the genetic contribution it shares with accuracy of phonological decoding, a genetic contribution to phonological nonword memory in addition to the genetic contribution it shares with written spelling, a genetic contribution to written spelling in addition to the genetic contribution it shares with accuracy of phonological decoding, and a genetic contribution to inattention ratings in addition to the genetic contribution it shares with either RAS or oral reading rate. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

These procedures are well studied in experienced readers, but less is known about their status during development. To investigate how visual properties influence the origins of coordinated processing, the current study combined rapid automatized naming (RAN) with an eye-tracking paradigm and compared the timing of fixations and vocalizations in typically developing adults and 6-year-old children. Within RAN displays, sequences varied visual features of items (i.e., similar such as p–q vs. dissimilar such as p–t) and their locations in rows (i.e., row-initial vs. row-medial positions). Adults and children accessed parafoveal preview of subsequent items when fixating on current items, leading to longer latency to speak for similar items compared with dissimilar ones. Both groups also vocalized previous items while fixating on current items, leading to longer eye–voice overlap for row-medial items compared with row-initial ones. Yet, relative to adults, children exhibited exaggerated delays in latency to speak from parafoveal preview and reduced eye–voice overlap due to row transitions. Together, this suggests that coordinated processing is present at the earliest points of development but that greater inexperience increases susceptibility to momentary visual hurdles. Relationships to previous work on real-time RAN performance in dyslexic adults and children are discussed."

Readers with dyslexia are considered to have less ""automatized"" access to lexical information, reflected in longer RAN times compared with nondyslexic readers. We combined the RAN task with a Stroop-switch manipulation to test the automaticity of dyslexic and nondyslexic readers' lexical access directly within a fluency task. Participants named letters in 10 x 4 arrays while eye movements and speech responses were recorded. Upon fixation, specific letter font colors changed from black to a different color, whereupon the participant was required to rapidly switch from naming the letter to naming the letter color. We could therefore measure reading group differences on ""automatic"" lexical processing, insofar as it was task-irrelevant. Readers with dyslexia showed obligatory lexical processing and a timeline for recognition that was overall similar to typical readers, but a delay emerged in the output (naming) phase. Further delay was caused by visual-orthographic competition between neighboring stimuli. Our findings outline the specific processes involved when researchers speak of ""impaired automaticity"" in dyslexic readers' fluency, and are discussed in the context of the broader literature in this field."

Fifty-four readers with dyslexia in Grades 5 and 6 were compared with 54 chronological age-matched (CA) typical readers on the following measures of cognitive-linguistic and literacy skills: morphological awareness, phonological awareness, visual-orthographic knowledge, rapid naming, vocabulary knowledge, verbal short-term memory (STM), Chinese word reading, and dictation (or spelling). The results indicated that early adolescent readers with dyslexia performed less well than the typical readers on all cognitive-linguistic and literacy measures except the phonological measures. Both groups’ scores showed substantial correlations between morphological awareness and Chinese word reading and dictation. Visual-orthographic knowledge and rapid naming were also associated with dictation in early adolescent readers with and without dyslexia, respectively. Moderated multiple regression analyses further revealed that morphological awareness and rapid naming explained unique variance in word reading and dictation for the readers with dyslexia and typical readers separately after controlling readers’ age and group effect. These results highlight the potential importance of morphological awareness and rapid naming in Chinese word reading and writing in Chinese early adolescents’ literacy development and impairment."

Children were tested on pure copying of unfamiliar stimuli, rapid automatized naming (RAN), phoneme deletion, syllable deletion, and morphological awareness. With children’s ages and Raven’s nonverbal reasoning statistically controlled, the PE and PB groups were significantly lower than the C group on phoneme deletion and RAN tasks, while the DG performed significantly better than the PB group on the RAN task. The copying task distinguished the DG group from the C group. Findings particularly highlight the importance of phoneme awareness for word reading in English (but not Chinese), the potential need for fluency training for children with reading difficulties in both Chinese and English, and the important role that copying skills could have specifically in understanding impairment of literacy skills in Chinese (but not English)."

Support for the claim is based largely on studies of rapid naming of repetitively presented pictured objects or other nameable stimuli, a task which is apparently more sensitive to retrieval problems than the confrontation naming of items presented singly. The purpose of this study was to examine whether there is a general relationship between word retrieval speed and reading ability in beginning readers. Although such a relationship has not been detected with confrontation naming, repetitive naming may provide a more sensitive test. Accordingly, second-grade children were required to name as rapidly as possible repeated presentations of five pictured items drawn from a single category. Separate naming tests were made for objects, colors, animals, letters, and words. The results showed that there was no relationship between reading ability and naming times when the test items were selected from sets of objects, colors, or animals, whereas on letters and words, a significant relationship was found. The lessskilled readers were not, therefore, consistently slower in all repetitive naming situations. Instead their word retrieval deficits extended only to the orthographic materials."

Subjects also completed tests of rapid oral and manual sequencing skills and standardized tests of reading ability. Each subject was tested at 4, 6, and 8 years old. The results showed that LI children perform significantly poorer on both versions of the RAN than age-matched controls. Correlations between RAN scores and tests of reading ability were significant for normal and LI subjects and were particularly high for 8-year-old LI children. RAN-manual scores also correlated with 8-year-old LI children's reading scores. Further, RAN and RAN-manual scores for the LI children correlated significantly with these children's manual sequencing abilities, whereas this was not the case for the control subjects.

Hence, one of the purposes of this study was to examine the structure of the PT in dyslexia and ADHD. The other purposes included examining the PT in relation to overall expressive language ability and in relation to several specific linguistic functions given language functioning often is affected in both dyslexia and ADHD. Participants included 50 children: 10 with dyslexia, 15 with comorbid dyslexia/ADHD, 15 with ADHD, and 10 controls. Using a 2 (dyslexia or not) × 2 (ADHD or not) MANCOVA, findings revealed PT length and shape were comparable between those with and without dyslexia. However, children with ADHD had smaller right PT lengths than those without ADHD, and right anterior ascending ramus length was related to attention problems in the total sample. In terms of linguistic functioning, presence of an extra sulcus in the left PT was related to poor expressive language ability. In those with adequate expressive language functioning, left PT length was related to phonological awareness, phonological short-term memory and rapid automatic naming (RAN).

In contrast to English, which is based on grapheme-phoneme relationships, the primary components of Japanese orthography are two syllabaries—hiragana and katakana (collectively termed “kana”)—and a system of morphosyllabic symbols (kanji). Three RAN tasks (numbers, objects, syllabary symbols [hiragana]) were used with kindergartners, with an additional kanji RAN task included for first graders. Reading measures included accuracy and speed of passage reading for kindergartners and first graders, and reading comprehension for first graders. In kindergartners, hiragana RAN and number RAN were the only significant predictors of reading accuracy and speed. In first graders, kanji RAN and hiragana RAN predicted reading speed, whereas accuracy was predicted by mora deletion.

Here, we apply the developmental trajectories approach, a new methodology developed for studying language and cognitive impairments in developmental disorders, to both poor reader groups. The trajectory methodology enables identification of atypical versus delayed development in datasets gathered using group matching designs. Regarding the cognitive predictors of reading, which here are phonological awareness, phonological short-term memory (PSTM) and rapid automatized naming (RAN), the method showed that trajectories for the two groups diverged markedly. Children with dyslexia showed atypical development in phonological awareness, while low IQ poor readers showed developmental delay. Low IQ poor readers showed atypical PSTM and RAN development, but children with dyslexia showed developmental delay. These divergent trajectories may have important ramifications for supporting each type of poor reader, although all poor readers showed weakness in all areas. Regarding auditory processing, the developmental trajectories were very similar for the two poor reader groups. However, children with dyslexia demonstrated developmental delay for auditory discrimination of Duration, while the low IQ children showed atypical development on this measure. The data show that, regardless of IQ, poor readers have developmental trajectories that differ from typically developing children.

Yet little is known about automaticity's neurophysiologic underpinnings. The more efficiently sound is encoded, the more automatic sound processing can be. In turn, this automaticity could free up cognitive resources such as attention and working memory to help build an integrative reading network. Therefore, we hypothesized that automaticity and reading fluency correlate with stable neural representation of sounds, given a larger body of literature suggesting the close relationship between neural stability and the integrative function in the central auditory system. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the frequency-following responses (FFR) to speech syllables and administered cognitive and reading measures to school-aged children. We show that the stability of neural responses to speech correlates with RAN and processing speed, but not phonological awareness. Moreover, the link between neural stability and RAN mediates the previously-determined link between neural stability and reading ability. Children with a RAN deficit have especially unstable neural responses. Our neurophysiological approach illuminates a potential neural mechanism specific to RAN, which in turn indicates a relationship between synchronous neural firing in the auditory system and automaticity critical for reading fluency."

In a sample of 78 dyslexic 3rd graders selected on the basis of their poor word recognition skills, reading accuracy for both words and non-words was deficient but high in absolute terms. This indicates that the highly consistent grapheme–phoneme correspondences of German orthography in combination with the straightforward phonics teaching approach, which is usually applied in Austrian primary schools, allows even dyslexic children to acquire the process of phonological decoding. The central reading problem was extremely slow speed. Poor performance on a reading comprehension test was at least partly due to slow reading speed as well. Dyslexic children's spelling development was also severely delayed. The number of phonologically incorrect spellings was low; however, dyslexic children quite often produced spellings that are orthographically incorrect, indicating that they have not yet been able to develop an extensive and easily accessible orthographic lexicon. The most prominent cognitive deficit was reduced rapid naming speed closely followed by deficits in phonological awareness. Deficits in phonological memory were also evident (but mild) showing that despite marked differences in findings on reading and spelling skills of English dyslexic children, the underlying causes are very similar. The present sample of dyslexic children showed deficits in visual processing speed in addition to their linguistic deficits. However, this deficit in visual processing speed did not seem causally related to the children's reading and spelling deficits. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Reading Age was assessed independently and results were analysed by multiple logistic regression. Spatially loaded naming tasks performed at speed exposed a Spatial Loading Factor which clearly differentiates children at risk with reading."

A Malay reading-related assessment battery which was conceptualised based on the International Dyslexia Association definition of dyslexia was developed and validated for the purpose of dyslexia assessment. The battery consisted of ten tests: Letter Naming, Word Reading, Non-word Reading, Spelling, Passage Reading, Reading Comprehension, Listening Comprehension, Elision, Rapid Letter Naming and Digit Span. Content validity was established by expert judgment. Concurrent validity was obtained using the schools’ language tests as criterion. Evidence of predictive and construct validity was obtained through regression analyses and factor analyses. Phonological awareness was the most significant predictor of word-level literacy skills in Malay, with rapid naming making independent secondary contributions. Decoding and listening comprehension made separate contributions to reading comprehension, with decoding as the more prominent predictor. Factor analysis revealed four factors: phonological decoding, phonological naming, comprehension and verbal short-term memory. In conclusion, despite differences in orthography, there are striking similarities in the theoretical constructs of reading-related tasks in Malay and in English."

This Swedish study compared reading skills between seven-year-old children with a very low birthweight (VLBW) and controls with a normal birthweight, exploring associations between reading variables and cognition, parent-rated behaviour, perinatal factors and family factors.



Methods

We studied 51 VLBW children, with no major neurodevelopmental impairments and attending their first year at a regular school, and compared them with the 51 sex- and age-matched controls. The test battery, carried out at 7.8 ± 0.4 years of age, included reading skills, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – III and the Child Behaviour Checklist.



Results

Very low birthweight children with a mean birthweight of 1105 g (±291 g) and a gestational age of 28.8 (±2.2) weeks scored significantly lower in all reading subtests and cognition and demonstrated more behavioural problems than normal birthweight controls. We also found significant associations between poor vocabulary, combined with attention problems, and phonological awareness, rapid naming and spelling control. Perinatal factors had no association with reading function, and socio-economic factors had very few.



Conclusion

Very low birthweight children demonstrated deficits in all reading domains and had poorer cognition and more behavioural problems at the age of seven, with reading ability related to vocabulary and attention."

Experiment 1 showed that naming times decrease rapidly with practice. Retention of this newly acquired skill in rapid naming was a function of the degree of learning during training. ""Overlearning"" was necessary to prevent forgetting of the skill. Experiment 2 indicated that the rate at which the naming gains were acquired, and the amount of forgetting, was unrelated to the specific orthographic to phonological correspondences among the trained words. Experiment 3 suggested that even when the spelling/sound regularities were used to facilitate learning, there was no generalization of the naming time skill to new words that share the same spelling/sound relations.

DD is defined by isolated reading deficits. SLI is defined by poor receptive and expressive oral language skills. Reading deficits, although prevalent, are not necessary for the diagnosis of SLI. An enduring question is whether these two disorders are qualitatively different or simply differ quantitatively along a dimension of severity. Here we address this problem by examining neuroanatomical correlates of reading and language in children with learning disabilities. We asked whether a quantitative anatomical risk index derived from previous work could predict behavioural profiles in a heterogeneous sample of 14 boys and 8 girls (11–16 years of age) with reading and language impairments. The results confirmed our predictions that (i) children with relatively smaller and symmetrical brain structures (negative risk indices) would have the severe comprehension impairments typical of SLI; (ii) children with larger, asymmetrical brain structures (positive risk indices) would have poor word reading in the presence of relatively preserved comprehension, a profile typical of DD; and (iii) the best performance would be seen in children with anatomical risk indices near zero (normal anatomy). Also, in confirmation of previous work, rapid automatic naming was not predicted by the anatomical risk index, but by anatomical measures derived from the frontal lobes. These results highlight the key significance of comprehension deficits in distinguishing DD from SLI. Reading impaired children with and without comprehension deficits appear to occupy neuroanatomical domains on the opposite sides of normal."

It was hypothesized that the target students would perform poorly on these cognitive and linguistic tasks as compared with their controls. Furthermore, verbal working memory and pseudoword reading would explain a considerable amount of individual variation in Chinese text comprehension.

We present the results from a 3-year longitudinal study. RAN, measured with nonalphabetic stimuli before reading instruction has begun, is a predictor of later growth in reading fluency. After reading instruction has started, RAN continues to exert an influence on the development of reading fluency over the next 2 years. However, there is no evidence of a reciprocal influence of reading fluency on the growth of RAN skill. We suggest that RAN taps the integrity of left-hemisphere object-recognition and naming circuits that are recruited to function as a critical component of the child's developing visual word-recognition system."

Methods:  In addition to the KBIT, the participants were administered standardized measures of reading, vocabulary, rapid naming, phonological skills and an experimental measure of rhyme judgement.



Results:  There was wide variability in the reading achievement among the individuals with WS. While some participants were unable to recognize letters of the alphabet, others scored within the normal range of tests of single word reading and decoding. Reading scores were correlated with intelligence as measured on KBIT matrices but not with the vocabulary measures. Reading also correlated with phonological awareness tasks yet, surprisingly, not with rapid naming.



Conclusion:  It is suggested that in individuals with retardation, intelligence rather than language and language-related skills predict achievements in word reading."

Taken together, these findings suggest that RAN is related to reading accuracy (and partly to reading fluency) because children must access orthographic representations from long-term memory. Although accessing these representations is sufficient for accurate word recognition, it is not sufficient for fluent reading, which also requires efficient parafoveal processing."

Here we show that in at-risk infants, brain activation to pseudowords at left hemisphere predicts 44% of reading speed at 14 years, and even improves the prediction after taking into account neurocognitive preschool measures of letter naming, phonology, and verbal short-term memory. The association between infant brain responses and reading speed is mediated by preschool rapid automatized naming ability. Therefore, we suggest that rapid naming and reading speed could share a similar cognitive process of automatized access to lexicon via phonological representations, and brain activation to speech sounds in infancy probably acts as an index of deficient development of the same process."

In our study, we tested how two forms of training: based on AVG and on phonological non-action video games (PNAVG), affect reading in a group of fifty-four Polish children with dyslexia. Both speed and accuracy of reading increased in AVG as much as in PNAVG group. Moreover, both groups improved in phonological awareness, selective attention and rapid naming. Critically, the reading progress in the two groups did not differ from a dyslexic control group which did not participate in any training. Thus, the observed improvement in reading in AVG and PNAVG can be attributed either to the normal reading development related to schooling or to test practice effect.

During the training, 18 beginning and 27 advanced readers (in Grades 2, 4, and 5) repeatedly read a set of pseudowords in either lowercase or mixed case. During this training, case mixing appeared to impair reading speed in both reader groups. At posttest, 1 day after the training, case format was either the same as or different from that during the training. Lowercase pseudowords were recognized faster after a lowercase training than after a mixed-case training. In a second study, case was found not to affect the rapid naming of single letters. The combined results suggest that case mixing disrupted the multiletter features in pseudowords and that the disruption of these features can affect the acquisition of orthographic knowledge."

In a sample of 100 nuclear families with DD (229 offspring) and 83 unrelated typical readers, we tested whether a set of well-established, cognitive phenotypes related to DD [i.e. rapid auditory processing (RAP), rapid automatized naming (RAN), multisensory nonspatial attention and visual motion processing] fulfilled the criteria of the EP construct. Visual motion and RAP satisfied all testable criteria (i.e. they are heritable, associate with the disorder, co-segregate with the disorder within a family and represent reproducible measures) and are therefore solid EPs of DD. Multisensory nonspatial attention satisfied three of four criteria (i.e. it associates with the disorder, co-segregates with the disorder within a family and represents a reproducible measure) and is therefore a potential EP for DD. Rapid automatized naming is heritable but does not meet other criteria of the EP construct. We provide the first evidence of a methodologically and statistically sound approach for identifying EPs for DD to be exploited as a solid alternative basis to clinical phenotypes in neuroscience."

The dyslexic deficit was also found when phonological retrieval cues were provided and when the to-be-learned pseudonames were presented in spoken as well as printed form. However, the dyslexic children showed no name-learning deficit when short, familiar words were used and they also had no difficulty with immediate repetition of the pseudowords. The dyslexic children's difficulty in learning new phonological forms was associated with pseudoword-repetition and naming-speed deficits assessed at the beginning of school, but not with phonological awareness and visual–motor impairments. We propose that the difficulty in learning new phonological forms may affect reading and spelling acquisition via impaired storage of new phonological forms, which serve as phonological underpinnings of the letter patterns of words or parts of words."

Method: Forty-seven at-risk children (21 who were initially language delayed and 26 with familial risk) and 47 control children matched on age, IQ, and mothers’ education were tested on syllable awareness, tone detection, rapid automatized naming, visual skill, morphological awareness, and word reading at age 5 and subsequently tested for dyslexia on a standard Hong Kong measure at age 7. Results: Of those with an early language delay, 62% subsequently manifested dyslexia; for those with familial risk, the rate of dyslexia was 50%. Those with dyslexia were best distinguished from those without dyslexia by the age-5 measures of morphological awareness, rapid automatized naming, and word reading itself; other measures did not distinguish the groups.

RD and ADHD co-occur more frequently than would be expected by chance (estimates of 25% – 40% in both disorders) (Willcutt & Pennington, 2000). This study presents a multiple cognitive deficit model of RD, ADHD, and their comorbidity.

Multiple deficit models (Pennington, 2006) propose a multifactorial etiology for complex developmental and psychiatric disorders where the constellation of risk and protective factors determines outcome. Comorbidity is to be expected when risk factors are shared between disorders. Despite increasing theoretical and empirical support for multiple deficit models, there has been little research directly evaluating whether such models can account for comorbidity.

Neuropsychological studies of RD, ADHD, and other disorders have primarily focused on identifying cognitive deficits specific to a given disorder. For RD, the deficits identified include phonological awareness (Vellutino, Fletcher, Snowling, & Scanlon, 2004), other aspects of speech and language processing (Bishop & Adams, 1990), naming speed (Compton, Olson, DeFries, & Pennington, 2002; Purvis & Tannock, 2000; Semrud-Clikeman, Guy, Griffin, & Hynd, 2000; Wolf & Bowers, 1999), processing speed (Caravolas, Volin, & Hulme, 2005; Catts, Gillispie, Leonard, Kail, & Miller, 2002; Kail & Hall, 1994; Shanahan et al., 2006; Willcutt, Pennington, Olson, Chhabildas, & Hulslander, 2005), and verbal working memory (Rucklidge & Tannock, 2002; Swanson, Mink, & Bocian, 1999; Willcutt et al., 2001; Willcutt, Pennington et al., 2005).

In the case of ADHD, there is less agreement about neuropsychological deficits. One candidate that has received considerable research attention is executive functioning, most notably response inhibition (Barkley, 1997), but also organization/planning and working memory (Willcutt, Doyle, Nigg, Faraone, & Pennington, 2005). In addition to executive functioning impairments, children with ADHD demonstrate cognitive weaknesses in domains such as processing speed (Shanahan et al., 2006) and naming speed (Rucklidge & Tannock, 2002).

Taken together, these studies identify specific cognitive deficits in RD and ADHD as well as potential shared deficits in processing speed, naming speed, and verbal working memory. Of these deficits, processing speed has also emerged as a candidate shared deficit from studies analyzing combined samples of children with RD and ADHD (Shanahan et al., 2006; Willcutt, Pennington et al., 2005).

The current study has two specific aims. First, we test a multiple cognitive deficit model .of RD and ADHD using structural equation modeling (SEM). Secondly, we test the multiple deficit models of RD and ADHD simultaneously to determine if any of the cognitive dimensions are predictive of both RD and ADHD dimensions. If so, we will explore the extent to which the cognitive factor(s) can account for the observed relationship between the RD and ADHD symptom dimensions. We predict that phonological awareness will be a unique predictor of RD, response inhibition will be a unique predictor of ADHD, and processing speed, naming speed and/or verbal working memory will be potential shared cognitive risk factors."

The Dyslexia group exhibited significant deficits in magnocellular temporal resolution compared with controls, but the two groups did not differ in parvocellular temporal resolution.

Conclusions & Implications: Discrete and serial naming tasks appear to assess different aspects of lexical access, and only partial support was obtained for the double-deficit hypothesis.

Three hundred eight Slovak and Czech children were recruited into three groups: family risk of dyslexia, speech/language difficulties and controls, and were assessed three times from kindergarten until Grade 1. There was a twofold increase in probability of reading problems in each risk group. Precursors of ‘dyslexia’ included difficulties in oral language and code-related skills (phoneme awareness, letter-knowledge and rapid automatized naming); poor performance in phonological memory and vocabulary was observed in both affected and unaffected high-risk peers. A two-group latent variable path model shows that early language skills predict code-related skills, which in turn predict literacy skills. Findings suggest that dyslexia in Slavic languages has its origins in early language deficits, and children who succumb to reading problems show impaired code-related skills before the onset of formal reading instruction.

The aim of this study was to assess the writing of 13 children with and 28 without dyslexia at age 11 years. A programme for keystroke logging was used to allow recording of typing activity as the children performed a sentence dictation task. Five sentences were read aloud twice each. The task was to type the sentence as correctly as possible, with no time constraints. The data were analysed from a product (spelling, grammar and semantics) and process (transcription fluency and revisions) perspective, using repeated measures ANOVA and t-tests to investigate group differences. Furthermore, the data were correlated with measures of rapid automatic naming and working memory. Results showed that the group with dyslexia revised their texts as much as the typical group, but they used more time, and the result was poorer. Moreover, rapid automatic naming correlated with transcription fluency, and working memory correlated with the number of semantic errors. This shows that dyslexia is generally not an issue of effort and that cognitive skills that are known to be important for reading also affect writing. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Findings indicated that the dyslexics' word retrieval deficits were one symptom of a more generalized, however subtle, oral language deficit which involved both receptive and expressive oral language functioning. The dyslexics' word retrieval problem also seemed chiefly related to language processing and not to deficits in semantic memory as there were no significant differences between dyslexics and controls on a nonverbal semantic memory task (picture categorization). In naming and identifying printed words, the dyslexics appeared to rely considerably upon the “indirect” or “assembly-of-phonology” route; they were slower in naming irregularly spelled words compared to regularly spelled words and on a lexical decision task, the dyslexics were slower in making negative decisions for “pseudohomophones” (e.g., “braik”) than for other matched nonwords.

Research has identified significant differences among children's math performance (Anderson, 2008). However, some studies do not provide a satisfactory rationalization for this variability (Geary, 2004). Although the differences are attributed to intelligence, this can only explain 9-25% of the variance in children's math achievement (Resing, Ruijssenaars, & Bosma, 2002). Recent studies indicate that other domain-general cognitive abilities, more specifically working memory (DeStefano, & LeFevre, 2004; Kyttala, & Lehto, 2008), may provide better explanations for variability in early math learning (Bull, Espy, & Wiebe, 2008; Kroesbergen, Van de Rijt, & Van Luit, 2007; Van der Sluis, de Jong, & Van der Leij, 2007). Although there are several models of cognition, Baddeley's multicomponent model has often been used to explore the role of cognitive processing in mathematical problem-solving (Swanson, Jerman, & Zheng, 2008). To comprehend and solve early math tasks, one must be able to keep track of incoming information (Swanson & Beebe-Frankenberger, 2004). This is necessary to understand words, phrases, and sentences that, in turn, are necessary to construct a coherent and meaningful interpretation of the tasks. This study focuses on children's knowledge of preparatory math skills that usually receive little attention in schools. …"

The performance of 26 self-reported dyslexic adults was compared with that of a comparison group of 47 adults with no history of reading or spelling difficulties. Participants completed standardized and experimental measures tapping literacy skills, working memory, phonological awareness and rapid naming. Spelling problems were the most prominent marker of dyslexia in adults, followed by text reading fluency and nonword decoding. Working memory and phoneme awareness explained unique variance in spelling, whereas rapid automatized naming explained unique variance in reading fluency and nonword reading. The moderate to strong correlations between self-reported history, self-rating of current literacy skills and outcomes on literacy tests indicate that adults estimated their literacy skills fairly well. Results suggest that spelling impairments, more strongly than reading impairments, make adults perceive themselves as being dyslexic. A combination of three literacy and three cognitive tests predicted group membership with 90.4% accuracy. It appears that weaknesses in phoneme awareness, rapid automatized naming and working memory are strong and persistent correlates of literacy problems even in adults learning a relatively transparent orthography.

Practitioner Points

Support for separate subtypes of dyslexia, with and without phonological deficits (PDs), indicates a need for different approaches to intervention.
A discrepancy-based criterion identifies more non-PD cases that may be missed with a response-to-intervention diagnosis.
Sound symbol correspondence and decoding measures may best distinguish cases of dyslexia with and without PDs."

One of the most debated perspectives argues that RAN measures orthographic processing, defined as the ability to process groups of letters or entire words as single units. Given that reading familiar spelling patterns will rely on orthographic processing more than reading unfamiliar spelling patterns, manipulating orthographic syllable frequency can be a useful tool to examine RAN’s relationship with orthographic familiarity. To meet this aim, RAN’s concurrent and longitudinal contribution to reading speed of nonwords composed of high and low syllable frequency, as well as real words, was assessed in a sample of 142 Spanish children. RAN, phonological skills, and visual skills were measured in kindergarten and Grade 5, whereas reading speed was measured in Grade 5 only. Both longitudinal and concurrent path analyses revealed that RAN made a comparable contribution to the reading of both types of nonwords as well as to real-word reading. This suggests that the reading-related cognitive ability measured by RAN operates at a grapho-phonemic, grapho-syllabic, and whole-word level.

The relationship among these constructs has been debated, and several theories have emerged to explain the unique role of each in reading ability/disability. Furthermore, the stability of identification of risk based on these measures varies widely across studies, due in part to the different cut-offs employed to designate risk. We applied a latent profile analysis technique with a diverse sample of 1215 kindergarten and pre-kindergarten students from 20 schools, to investigate whether PA, RAN, letter knowledge, and verbal short-term memory measures differentiated between homogenous profiles of performance on these measures. Six profiles of performance emerged from the data: average performers, below average performers, high performers, PA risk, RAN risk, and double-deficit risk (both PA and RAN). A latent class regression model was employed to investigate the longitudinal stability of these groups in a representative subset of children (n = 95) nearly two years later, at the end of 1st grade. Profile membership in the spring semester of pre-kindergarten or fall semester of kindergarten was significantly predictive of later reading performance, with the specific patterns of performance on the different constructs remaining stable across the years.

Both types of stimuli required identical oral responses, controlling for effects associated with speech production. Results showed that naming dice was much slower than naming digits for both groups, but group differences in eye-movement measures and in the eye-voice span (i.e., the distance between the currently fixated item and the voiced item) were generally larger in digit-RAN than in dice-RAN. In addition, dyslexics were less efficient in parafoveal processing in these RAN tasks. Since the two RAN tasks required the same phonological output and on the assumption that naming dice is less practiced than naming digits in general, the results suggest that the translation of alphanumeric visual symbols into phonological codes is less efficient in dyslexic children. The dissociation of the print-to-sound conversion and phonological representation suggests that the degree of automaticity in translation from visual symbols to phonological codes in addition to phonological processing per se is also critical to understanding dyslexia.

This study was designed to examine the behavioral profiles of two groups, a younger (6–8 years) and an older (10–15 years) group of dyslexic children for the purposes of (1) evaluating the degree to which phonological awareness and processing speed deficits occur in the two developmental cohorts; (2) determining the strength of relationships between the groups’ respective mean scores on cognitive tasks of phonological awareness and processing speed and their scores on component skills of reading; and (3) evaluating the degree to which phonological awareness and processing speed serve as concurrent predictors of component reading skills for each group. NA The mean scaled scores for both groups were similar on all but one processing speed task. The older group was significantly more depressed on a visual matching test of attention, scanning, and speed. Correlations between reading skills and the cognitive constructs were very similar for both age-groups. Neither of the two phonological awareness tasks correlated with either of the two processing speed tasks or with any of the three measures of reading. One of the two processing speed measures served as a concurrent predictor of word- and text-level reading in the younger, however, only the rapid naming measure functioned as a concurrent predictor of word reading in the older group. Conversely, phonological processing measures did not serve as concurrent predictors for word-level or text-level reading in either of the groups. Descriptive analyses of individual subjects’ deficits in the domains of phonological awareness and processing speed revealed that (1) both linguistic and nonlinguistic processing speed deficits in the younger dyslexic children occurred at higher rates than deficits in phonological awareness and (2) cognitive deficits within and across these two domains were greater in the older dyslexic children. NA Our findings underscore the importance of using rapid naming measures when testing school-age children suspected of having a reading disability and suggest that processing speed measures that do not reply on verbal responses may serve as predictors of reading disability in young children prior to their development of naming automaticity."

Studies have also shown that there is considerable variability not only for initial reading level when children begin formalized instruction, but also in the rate of subsequent growth (Parrila, Aunola, Leskinen, Nurmi, & Kirby, 2005).

Researchers have gained insight into this variability by examining indices of the family and school that predict individual differences in initial reading as well as growth in performance. Children from higher-SES households tend to have higher initial reading scores and show faster rates of growth compared with children from lower-SES households (e.g., Aikens & Barbarin, 2008; Cheadle, 2008). Additionally, initial rates of reading performance and rates of subsequent growth are higher when parents show high levels of educational involvement (Cheadle, 2008) and provide rich home literacy experiences (Aikens & Barbarin, 2008). School factors such as the type and quality of teacher instruction have also shown significant relations with student reading outcomes (Connor et al., 2009; Foorman et al., 2006; National Reading Panel, 2000) and have also been implicated as significant contributors to growth in student reading performance during the school year (Foorman, Francis, Fletcher, Schatschneider, & Mehta, 1998; Nye, Konstantopoulos, & Hedges, 2004).

At the same time, quantitative genetic studies have established the importance of both genetic and environmental influences on overall reading ability and disability (e.g., DeFries, Fulker, & LaBuda, 1987; Harlaar, Dale, & Plomin, 2007; Petrill, Deater-Deckard, Thompson, DeThorne, & Schatschneider, 2006a; Samuelsson et al., 2008; Stevenson, Graham, Fredman, & McLoughlin, 1987), as well as on the skills that support reading ability, including vocabulary, print knowledge, phoneme awareness/decoding, spelling, and orthographic coding (e.g., Bates et al., 2004; Byrne et al., 2008; Friend, DeFries, Wadsworth, & Olson, 2007; Gayan, & Olson, 2003; Petrill, Deater-Deckard, Thompson, DeThorne, & Schatschneider, 2006b). To date, behavioral genetic studies have focused on two issues related to reading development. First, studies have examined how the relative magnitude of genetic and environmental effects varies as a function of child age. For example, genetic effects tend to be consistently important at all ages for fluency, and tend to become increasingly more important with age for phoneme awareness (Byrne et al., 2005; Petrill et al., 2007). At the same time, environmental influences appear to be consistently important across age for letter knowledge and word knowledge (Petrill et al., 2007) and may become more important with age for spelling (Friend et al., 2007).

Second, behavioral genetic research has also focused on the stability of reading outcomes; in particular whether the same genetic and environmental factors remain consistent over time (e.g. Byrne et al., 2007; Harlaar et al., 2007; Betjemann et al., 2008; Wadsworth, DeFries, Olson, & Willcutt, 2007; Petrill et al., 2007). These studies suggest that the stability and instability in reading skills is substantially influenced by genetic factors. However, these studies also provide evidence for environmental overlap across measurement occasions as well as the emergence of new environmental factors as reading skills develop.

However, behavioral genetic studies to date have not examined growth in reading performance – in particular, how genetics and environment impact individual differences in how quickly or slowly children’s reading and related skills improve over time. This is unfortunate given that much of the larger contemporary reading literature, particularly the intervention literature, has focused on growth as an outcome measure. Genetic and environmental factors may not just contribute to the variance of reading skills at a particular age or to the stability of individual differences of reading skills at different ages, but also to the rate at which children make reading gains. Another important issue is the extent to which genetic and environmental influences on the rate of reading growth are independent from genetic and environmental influences on initial performance. This is especially important in early reading where children come to formalized instruction with genetic variation related to reading and varying levels of preschool environmental supports for literacy; and are then educated in settings of varying instructional quality. Examining individual differences in growth in a genetically sensitive design may shed new light on children’s reading development, in particular, how genetic and environmental influences on subsequent growth are related to or independent from those genetic and environmental factors impacting initial performance.

Thus, the purpose of the current study was to conduct the first behavioral genetic analysis on the growth of reading skills. We examined 6 reading-related skills: word identification, letter identification, pseudoword decoding, expressive vocabulary, phoneme awareness, and rapid naming. We determined the extent to which genetic and environmental influences contributed to variance in: (1) initial levels of reading, (2) rates of growth, and (3) the association between initial level and rates of growth, including the degree to which the rate of growth was correlated with or independent from initial levels of reading."

More limited working memory capacity and slower processing for language and cognitive tasks are characteristics of many children with language difficulties. Individual differences in processing speed have not consistently been found to predict language ability or severity of language impairment. There are conflicting views on whether working memory and processing speed are integrated or separable abilities.



Aims

To evaluate four models for the relations of individual differences in children's processing speed and working memory capacity in sentence imitation. The models considered whether working memory and processing speed are integrated or separable, as well as the effect of the number of operations required per sentence. The role of working memory as a mediator of the effect of processing speed on sentence imitation was also evaluated.



Methods & Procedures

Forty-six children with varied language and reading abilities imitated sentences. Working memory was measured with the Competing Language Processing Task (CLPT), and processing speed was measured with a composite of truth-value judgment and rapid automatized naming tasks. Mixed-effects ordinal regression models evaluated the CLPT and processing speed as predictors of sentence imitation item scores. A single mediator model evaluated working memory as a mediator of the effect of processing speed on sentence imitation total scores.



Outcomes & Results

Working memory was a reliable predictor of sentence imitation accuracy, but processing speed predicted sentence imitation only as a component of a processing speed by number of operations interaction. Processing speed predicted working memory capacity, and there was evidence that working memory acted as a mediator of the effect of processing speed on sentence imitation accuracy.



Conclusions & Implications

The findings support a refined view of working memory and processing speed as separable factors in children's sentence imitation performance. Processing speed does not independently explain sentence imitation accuracy for all sentence types, but contributes when the task requires more mental operations. Processing speed also has an indirect effect on sentence imitation by contributing to working memory capacity."
START,START,2808698113,the short and long term predictions of reading accuracy and speed from paired associate learning,2018,"mads poulsen, carsten elbro",journal of experimental child psychology,1,1,23,"Abstract NA NA Cross-sectional studies have established that performance on paired-associate learning (PAL) tasks is associated with reading performance. There are good reasons to expect such a relationship because learning to read involves learning the sounds of individual letters and possibly also sounds of strings of letters (e.g., spelling patterns). However, results from longitudinal studies have been mixed. A closer look at these studies suggests that PAL may be related to development of accuracy rather than speed in reading. This suggestion was investigated directly in the current longitudinal study. The study followed 137 students from Grade 0 (kindergarten) to Grade 5. In Grade 0, they completed measures of PAL, letter knowledge, phoneme awareness, and rapid automatized naming (RAN). In Grades 1 and 5, decoding accuracy was measured with the addition of decoding speed in Grade 5. PAL in Grade 0 was found to be a unique predictor of decoding accuracy in Grades 1 and 5 after controlling for Grade 0 letter knowledge, phoneme awareness, and RAN. PAL in Grade 0 even contributed to Grade 5 decoding accuracy after also controlling for Grade 1 decoding. Zero-order correlations between PAL and Grade 5 decoding speed were nonsignificant and close to zero. The results indicate that PAL measures a trait that may influence reading development over a substantial amount of time. Possible roles of PAL in decoding development over time are discussed, for example, how verbal learning may be a core component in the acquisition of associations between letter patterns (spelling patterns) and their pronunciation."

However, early screening may be too inaccurate to effectively allocate resources to those who need them. The present study compared the accuracy of early screening before the onset of formal reading instruction with late screening six months into the first year of instruction. The study followed 164 Danish students from the end of Grade 0 to the end of Grade 2. Early screening included measures of phonemic awareness, rapid naming, letter knowledge, paired associate learning, and reading. Late screening included only reading. Results indicated that reading measures improved substantially as predictors over the first six months of Grade 1, to the point where late reading measures alone provided as much information as the early measures combined. In the light of these results and a less than perfect early screening accuracy, a new strategy for screening is introduced and discussed. The strategy proposes multi-point screening with gradually increasing sensitivity to strike a balance between manageable screening procedures and outcomes and early identification of students who are most likely in need of extra resources.

Study 1 assessed RAN, phonological awareness, and reading performance in 1010 7- to 10-year-olds. Results showed that RAN deficits occurred in the absence of phonological awareness deficits. These were accompanied by modest reading delays. In structural equation modeling, solutions where RAN was subsumed within a phonological processing factor did not provide a good fit to the data, suggesting that processes outside phonology may drive RAN performance and its association with reading. Study 2 investigated Kail’s proposal that speed of processing underlies this relationship. Children with single RAN deficits showed slower speed of processing than did closely matched controls performing normally on RAN. However, regression analysis revealed that RAN made a unique contribution to reading even after accounting for processing speed. Theoretical implications are discussed."

In this study, 107 Greek children from Grade 2 and 107 from Grade 6 were tested with discrete and serial naming of digits, objects, and words in 50-item arrays. The correlation between discrete and serial word reading was very high in Grade 2 but only moderate in Grade 6. In confirmatory factor analysis, a reading–naming latent structure fit the Grade 2 data best; in contrast, a serial–discrete structure fit the Grade 6 data. Thus, the superficial longitudinal stability of RAN–reading correlations belies vastly different patterns of interrelations, indicative of changes in the developing cognitive processes underlying both naming and reading. Word fluency tasks in Grade 2 are apparently accomplished largely as a series of isolated individual word naming trials even though multiple individual letters in each word may be processed in parallel. In contrast, specifically serial procedures are applied in Grade 6, presumably via simultaneous processing of multiple individual words at successive levels. It is proposed that this feat requires endogenous control of cognitive cascades."

Of considerable importance is phonological processing, which is the processing of acoustic signals with linguistic content. Three areas of phonological processing have been found to be most important for reading and writing competence: phonological awareness, naming speed, and phonological working memory. Research on these components suggests that specific interventions tailored to individual phonological processing deficits may prevent later dyslexia. Therefore, it appears mandatory that earnose-throat physicians have at least a basic knowledge of the theory of phonological processing. This will enable proper consultation with parents of affected children."

One hundred forty-nine children, aged 10.40 to 14.00 years, participated in the study. The results indicated that the SD, DLD, and DLD/SD groups did not differ from each other on PA and RAN Letters and underperformed in comparison to the control groups. However, whereas the children with written language deficits (SD and DLD/SD groups) underperformed on RAN Objects and Digits, PWR, OA, and MA, the children with DLD and no SD performed similarly to the children from the control groups on these measures. In contrast, the two groups with spoken language deficits (DLD and DLD/SD) underperformed on RAN Colors in comparison to the control groups and the group of children with SD only. The results support the notion that those children with DLD who have unimpaired PWR and RAN skills are able to overcome their weaknesses in spoken language and PA and acquire basic literacy on a par with their age peers with typical language.

The performance of adults with CD (ages 17 to 23), chronological age-matched (CA) adults, and reading level-matched (RL) children was compared on measures of phonological processing, naming speed, working memory (WM), general knowledge, vocabulary, and comprehension. The results showed that adults with CD scored lower on measures of phonological processing, naming speed, WM, general knowledge, and vocabulary when compared to CA readers but were comparable to RL children on the majority of process measures. Phonological processing, naming speed, vocabulary, general knowledge, and listening comprehension contributed independent variance to reading comprehension accuracy, whereas WM, intelligence, phonological processing, and listening comprehension contributed independent variance to comprehension fluency. Adults with CD scored lower than CA adults and higher than RL children on measures of lexical processing, WM, and listening comprehension when word recognition and intelligence were partialed from the analysis. In summary, constraints in phonological processing and naming speed mediate only some of the influence of high-order processes on reading comprehension. Furthermore, adults with CD experience difficulties in WM, listening comprehension, and vocabulary independently of their word recognition problems and intellectual ability."
START,START,2131076504,structural brain alterations associated with dyslexia predate reading onset,2011,"nora maria raschle, maria chang, nadine gaab",neuroimage,1,136,80,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported reduced activation in parietotemporal and occipitotemporal areas in adults and children with developmental dyslexia compared to controls during reading and reading related tasks. These patterns of regionally reduced activation have been linked to behavioral impairments of reading-related processes (e.g., phonological skills and rapid automatized naming). The observed functional and behavioral differences in individuals with developmental dyslexia have been complemented by reports of reduced gray matter in left parietotemporal, occipitotemporal areas, fusiform and lingual gyrus and the cerebellum. An important question for education is whether these neural differences are present before reading is taught. Developmental dyslexia can only be diagnosed after formal reading education starts. However, here we investigate whether the previously detected gray matter alterations in adults and children with developmental dyslexia can already be observed in a small group of pre-reading children with a family-history of developmental dyslexia compared to age and IQ-matched children without a family-history (N = 20/mean age: 5:9 years; age range 5:1–6:5 years). Voxel-based morphometry revealed significantly reduced gray matter volume indices for pre-reading children with, compared to children without, a family-history of developmental dyslexia in left occipitotemporal, bilateral parietotemporal regions, left fusiform gyrus and right lingual gyrus. Gray matter volume indices in left hemispheric occipitotemporal and parietotemporal regions of interest also correlated positively with rapid automatized naming. No differences between the two groups were observed in frontal and cerebellar regions. This discovery in a small group of children suggests that previously described functional and structural alterations in developmental dyslexia may not be due to experience-dependent brain changes but may be present at birth or develop in early childhood prior to reading onset. Further studies using larger sample sizes and longitudinal analyses are needed in order to determine whether the identified structural alterations may be utilized as structural markers for the early identification of children at risk, which may prevent the negative clinical, social and psychological outcome of developmental dyslexia."

In order to elucidate distinct phenotypic features that may be contributing to the genotypic heterogeneity, we assessed the familial aggregation patterns of Verbal IQ and 24 phenotypic measures associated with dyslexia in 102 nuclear families ascertained through probands in grades 1 through 6 who met the criteria for this disorder. Correlations between relatives were computed for all diagnostic phenotypes, using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. GEE is a recently developed semiparametric method for handling correlated data. The method is robust to model misspecification and flexible in adjusting for the subjects' characteristics and pedigree sizes as well as for the ascertainment process, while estimating the correlations between related subjects. The Nonword Memory (NWM) subtest of a prepublication version of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP) and Phonemic Decoding Efficiency (PDE) subtest of a prepublication version of the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) showed correlation patterns in relatives that are strongly supportive of a genetic basis. The Wechsler Scale Digit Span, the Word Attack subtest of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test—Revised, and the Spelling subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test—Third Edition had slightly weaker evidence of a genetic basis. Five additional phenotypes (the Spelling subtest of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, the Accuracy, Rate, and Comprehension subtests of the Gray Oral Reading Test—Third Edition, and Rapid Automatized Naming of Letters and Numbers) gave suggestive evidence of such a pattern. The results cross-validate in that evidence for a pattern consistent with a genetic basis was obtained for two measures of phonological short-term memory (CTOPP Nonword Memory and WISCIII or WAIS-R Digit Span), for two measures of phonological decoding (WRMT-R Word Attack and TOWRE Phonemic Decoding Efficiency), and for two measures of spelling from dictation (WRAT-3 Spelling and, to a lesser extent, WIAT Spelling). These measures are thus good candidates for more sophisticated segregation analyses that can formulate models for incorporation into linkage analyses."

Radiation successfully abolished the tumor but caused radiation-induced tissue necrosis, primarily affecting cerebral white matter. S was introduced to us at age 15 because of her profound dyslexia. We assessed cognitive abilities and performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure cerebral white matter pathways. Diffuse white matter differences were evident in T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diffusion anisotropy, and mean diffusivity measures in S compared to a group of 28 normal female controls. In addition, we found specific white matter pathway deficits by comparing tensor-orientation directions in S's brain with those of the control brains. While her principal diffusion direction maps appeared consistent with those of controls over most of the brain, there were tensor-orientation abnormalities in the fiber tracts that form the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) in both hemispheres. Tractography analysis indicated that the left and right arcuate fasciculus (AF), as well as other tracts within the SLF, were missing in S. Other major white matter tracts, such as the corticospinal and inferior occipitofrontal pathways, were intact. Functional MRI measurements indicated left-hemisphere dominanance for language with a normal activation pattern. Despite the left AF abnormality, S had preserved oral language with average sentence repetition skills. In addition to profound dyslexia, S exhibited visuospatial, calculation, and rapid naming deficits and was impaired in both auditory and spatial working memory. We propose that the reading and visuospatial deficits were due to the abnormal left and right SLF pathways, respectively. These results advance our understanding of the functional significance of the SLF and are the first to link radiation necrosis with selective damage to a specific set of fiber tracts."

Females may be less impaired in executive function although adolescent females with ADHD have yet to be studied.

Method: Neuropsychological profiles of four adolescent groups aged 13–16 with equal female representation were investigated: 35 ADHD, 12 RD, 24 ADHD+RD, and 37 normal controls. A semi-structured interview (K-SADS-PL), the Conners Rating Scales and the Ontario Child Health Study Scales were used to diagnose ADHD. RD was defined as a standard score below 90 on at least one of the following: Reading or Spelling of the WRAT3 or Word Attack or Word Identification of the WRMT-R. The WISC-III, Rapid Automatized Naming, Stroop and Stop tasks were used as measures of cognitive and executive function.

Results: The two ADHD groups (ADHD, ADHD+RD) showed deficits in processing speed, naming of objects, poor behavioral inhibition and greater variability in reaction times whereas the two RD groups (RD, RD+ADHD) showed verbal working memory deficits and slower verbal retrieval speed. Only the comorbid group was slower with naming of numbers and colors and had slower reaction times. Regression analyses indicated that incongruent color naming (Stroop) and variability in go reaction time were the best predictors of hyperactive/impulsive ADHD symptoms whereas variability in go reaction time and processing speed were the best predictors of inattentive ADHD symptoms. Speed of letter naming and verbal working memory accounted for the most variability in composite achievement scores. No gender differences were found on any of the cognitive tests.

Conclusions: This study challenges the importance of behavioral inhibition deficits in ADHD and that naming deficits are specific to RD. Further investigation into cognitive deficits in these groups is required.

Yet fluent reading requires rapid visual recognition and semantic interpretation of new letters and words appearing in successive fixations of the eyes. Thus we wondered whether change detection performance was related to reading ability. We investigated whether children with developmental dyslexia (DD) were less able to detect change in a simple display–gap–display paradigm than normal reading (NR) children of the same age and children with impaired reading and mentation (LD). In a first experimental phase, the DDs required a longer initial exposure of four letter items in order to detect change of a single letter at a level of 71% correct, compared with NRs performing at the same level. Thus the deficit in reading in DD is associated with a deficit in early processes associated with visual recognition. In a second experimental phase (using the individual target display exposures measured in the first phase), cues appeared during the 250 ms gap for a period of either 0 (no cue), 50 or 200 ms immediately prior to the presentation of the second (comparison) display. Children of all groups showed dependence on the presence of the cue to help make a judgement of change (versus no change), with the NRs least affected. When change was detected in the presence of a cue, the NRs were better able to identify the new letter than either of the other groups. However, only about 50% of the correct detections were accompanied by a correct identification. Despite published reports of a mini-neglect for left visual field in dyslexic adults, none of our groups showed such an effect. However, a significant upper visual field (UpVF) advantage in change detection performance was found across groups, which we interpret in terms of the interactions of the ventral and dorsal streams."

Reading accuracy, rate, and fluency was measured among a sample of 67 children, the majority of whom were very poor readers. Regression analyses revealed that phonological processing tasks predicted reading accuracy and comprehension whereas rapid digit (but not picture) naming predicted reading accuracy and rate. After further controlling reading accuracy, digit naming was still a significant predictor of reading rate. This suggests that rapid alphanumeric naming is a highly specific predictor of reading rate and that rapid digit naming and phonological processing are distinct contributors to different aspects of reading in poor readers."

It is unknown, however, whether these differences in structural connectivity are related to the cause of dyslexia or if they are consequences of reading difficulty (e.g., less reading experience or compensatory brain organization). Here, in 40 kindergartners who had received little or no reading instruction, we examined the relation between behavioral predictors of dyslexia and white matter organization in left arcuate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and the parietal portion of the superior longitudinal fasciculus using probabilistic tractography. Higher composite phonological awareness scores were significantly and positively correlated with the volume of the arcuate fasciculus, but not with other tracts. Two other behavioral predictors of dyslexia, rapid naming and letter knowledge, did not correlate with volumes or diffusion values in these tracts. The volume and fractional anisotropy of the left arcuate showed a particularly strong positive correlation with a phoneme blending test. Whole-brain regressions of behavioral scores with diffusion measures confirmed the unique relation between phonological awareness and the left arcuate. These findings indicate that the left arcuate fasciculus, which connects anterior and posterior language regions of the human brain and which has been previously associated with reading ability in older individuals, is already smaller and has less integrity in kindergartners who are at risk for dyslexia because of poor phonological awareness. These findings suggest a structural basis of behavioral risk for dyslexia that predates reading instruction."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the consequences of grouping children based on the presence or absence of deficits in these skills. We demonstrate that the greater severity of reading impairment found in children with a double deficit could be due in part to a statistical artifact caused by grouping children based on their performance on two correlated continuous variables. This artifact also makes it difficult to establish the relative impact of deficits in naming speed on reading ability independent of deficits in phonological awareness."

Eyes-open rest EEG was measured at the age of 3 years, and the at-risk children were divided into fluent readers (n = 24) and non-fluent readers (n = 24) after reading assessment at their third grade of school. We found that fluent readers and non-fluent readers differed in normalized spectral amplitude. Non-fluent readers were characterized by lower amplitude in the delta-1 frequency band (0.5–2 Hz) and higher amplitude in the alpha-1 band (6–8 Hz) in multiple scalp regions compared to control and at-risk fluent readers. Interestingly, across groups these EEG biomarkers correlated with several behavioral test scores measured in the third grade. Specifically, the performance on reading fluency, phonological and orthographic tasks and rapid automatized naming task correlated positively with delta-1 and negatively with alpha-1.

The core symptoms are word reading and spelling deficits, but several other cognitive components influence the core phenotype. A broad spectrum of dyslexia related phenotypes, including phonological decoding, phoneme awareness, orthographic processing, short-term memory, rapid naming and basic mathematical abilities, were investigated in large sample of 287 German dyslexia families. We explored the interrelationship between the component phenotypes using correlation and principal component analyses (PCA). In addition, we estimated familiality for phenotypes as well as for the factors suggested by PCA. The correlation between the component phenotypes varied between − 0.1 and 0.7. The PCA resulted in three factors: a general dyslexia factor, a speed of processing factor and a mathematical abilities factor. The familiality estimates of single components and factors ranged between 0.25 and 0.63. Instead of analyzing single dyslexia-related components, multivariate analyses including factor analytic approaches may help in the identification of susceptibility genes."

NA NA NA Results NA For each hypothesized protective factor, we found variation in individual scores and sample mean scores at the lower end of the scales, indicating that these children fare worse than most children. However, many children experienced large changes in their individual scores over time suggesting that children can and do improve on these hypothesized protective factors. In examining the relationship between hypothesized protective factors and outcomes, children with higher levels of social competence were significantly more likely to be in the normal range for both externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Children with higher mean adaptive functioning skills were more likely to be in the normal range for both externalizing behavior and reading competence. The positive nature of the child's peer relationships was also related to externalizing behavior and reading competence. NA NA NA Conclusions NA Overall, our analyses support the idea that social competence, adaptive functioning skills, and peer relationships are related to outcomes for children investigated for maltreatment.

The first group consisted of Russian–Hebrew-speaking bilinguals who had acquired basic reading skills in Russian as their first language (L1) and literacy and who were literate in Hebrew as a second language. The second group consisted of Russian–Hebrew-speaking bilinguals who had not learned to read in their native Russian but had acquired Hebrew as their first literate language. The third group consisted of Hebrew-speaking monolingual children who were literate in Hebrew. This design facilitated examining the effect of biliteracy and bilingualism on basic English reading skills. We hypothesized that due to the proximity between the Russian and English orthographies as opposed to the Hebrew–English “distance,” the Russian–Hebrew-speaking biliterate group who acquired basic reading and spelling skills in L1 Russian would have superior self-teaching in English as opposed to the two other groups. The standard two-session self-teaching paradigm was employed with naming (speed and accuracy) and orthographic choice as posttest measures of orthographic learning. Results showed that after 4 years of English instruction, all three groups showed evidence of self-teaching on naming speed and orthographic recognition. The Russian–Hebrew-speaking biliterate group, moreover, showed a partial advantage over the comparison groups for initial decoding of target pseudowords and clear-cut superiority for measures of later orthographic learning, thereby showing self-teaching while supporting the script dependence hypothesis."

Validating this subdivision, we show that the nature of reading performance in these subgroups and their converging cognitive/linguistic profiles are unique and distinctive on variables other than the measures used to define them. While the rate-specific disability appeared to reflect a general deficit in speed of processing affecting reading rate, and rapid automatized naming of print-related material, the accuracy-only disability subgroup displayed selective deficits in phonological awareness and morphological knowledge. Biosocial, demographic, and instructional factors, furthermore, did not explain the sub-group differences.

In the last decade, there has been a growing interest, both in the UK and abroad, in developing early screening tests for dyslexia that can be used with very young children. In addition to measures of literacy achievement, such screening tests typically aim to identify underlying difficulties, such as phonological deficits, that might hinder a child's educational progress. The Dyslexia Early Screening Test (DEST; Nicolson & Fawcett, 1996) is an example of such a test that combines attainment and diagnostic indicators.

Aim. The study reported assessed the ability of the DEST to predict future literacy skills in contrast with the prediction afforded by school-based measures, such as letter knowledge.

Sample. Participants were 45 boys attending a reception class, with a mean age of 4.87 years at the start of the study and 6.63 years at the end.

Methods. Measures of literacy skills, phonological awareness, verbal memory, motor skill, and auditory processing were assessed using the DEST as the initial screening tool at Phase 1. Measures of letter knowledge, non-word reading, and rhyme judgment were taken at Phase 2. Phase 3 measures, 14 months after the start of the study, comprised single-word reading and spelling. At Phase 4, some 22 months after the beginning of the study, measures of reading and spelling ability were assessed again.

Results. Individual subtests of the DEST were more predictive of later literacy skills than the global screening test's score (the ‘at risk quotient’). Better predictors were the DEST subtest of sound order and rapid automatized naming, together with the school attainment measure of letter knowledge.

Conclusions. Although some DEST subtests did offer predictors of future literacy skills, school-based measures of letter knowledge may be equally valid as assessment measures. Additionally, the results question the usefulness of combining measures to form an ‘at risk’ index of future literacy difficulties, particularly in the age range assessed."

The group of children consisted of typically developing (TD) children (n = 32), children with MD (n = 26), children with RSD (n = 29), and combined MD and RSD (n = 43). It was hypothesized that, in line with the multiple deficit view on learning disorders, at least one unique predictor for both MD and RSD and a possible shared cognitive risk factor would be found to account for the comorbidity between the symptom dimensions literacy and math. Secondly, our hypotheses were that (a) a probabilistic multi-factorial risk factor model would provide a better fit to the data than a deterministic single risk factor model and (b) that a shared risk factor model would provide a better fit than the specific multi-factorial model. All our hypotheses were confirmed. NS and visuospatial WM were identified as unique cognitive predictors for MD, whereas PA and RAN were both associated with RSD. Also, a shared risk factor model with PA as a cognitive predictor for both RSD and MD fitted the data best, indicating that MD and RSD might co-occur due to a shared underlying deficit in phonological processing. Possible explanations are discussed in the context of sample selection and composition. This study shows that different cognitive factors play a role in mathematics and literacy, and that a phonological processing deficit might play a role in the occurrence of MD and RSD."

Natural Der fIII was isolated by affinity purification with the 5A12 monoclonal antibody. Amino acid sequence data was generated for both these proteins which was used to construct DNA probes to screen a Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus cDNA library by hybridization and resulted in the isolation of a recombinant Der p III cDNA clone, P3WSI. The 1059 bp cDNA fragment included a 786 bp open reading frame which encodes a pre-pro region of 29 amino acids and a mature protein of 232 amino acids with a calculated Mr 24985.

We report that children at family risk of dyslexia experience delayed language development as infants and toddlers. In the preschool period, they have significant difficulties in phonological processes as well as with broader language skills and in acquiring the foundations of decoding skill (letter knowledge, phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming [RAN]). Findings are mixed with regard to auditory and visual perception: they do not appear subject to slow motor development, but lack of control for comorbidities confounds interpretation. Longitudinal studies of outcomes show that children at family risk who go on to fulfil criteria for dyslexia have more severe impairments in preschool language than those who are defined as normal readers, but the latter group do less well than controls. Similarly at school age, family risk of dyslexia is associated with significantly poor phonological awareness and literacy skills. Although there is no strong evidence that children at family risk are brought up in an environment that differs significantly from that of controls, their parents tend to have lower educational levels and read less frequently to themselves. Together, the findings suggest that a phonological processing deficit can be conceptualized as an endophenotype of dyslexia that increases the continuous risk of reading difficulties; in turn its impact may be moderated by protective factors."

Tests of phonological memory skills indicated that when the tasks were controlled for presentation method and response modality, there were no differences between the performance of children with CIs and their counterparts with hearing. Tests of rapid naming revealed that there were no differences between rapid letter and number naming between the two groups. Results yielded a possible PP test battery for children with CI experience."
START,START,2010833350,developmental aspects of automatic word processing language lateralization of early erp components in children young adults and middle aged subjects,2009,"chiara spironelli, alessandro angrilli",biological psychology,1,63,68,"Abstract NA NA Reading words elicits a very early evoked potential termed “recognition potential” with a latency of about 150 ms and clearly located in left posterior regions. A review of the current literature indicates that N150 marks the automatic lexical classification of a word, is relatively independent of the task, and is followed by a later negative and more anterior component which is sensitive to the task. However, from the literature it is not clear whether the left lateralization of the neural networks involved in word recognition changes with age and experience, and how this lateralization is related with behavioral performance. To this aim, based on a previously validated paradigm [Spironelli, C., Angrilli, A., 2006. Language lateralization in Phonological, Semantic and Orthographic tasks: a slow evoked potential study. Behavioral Brain Research 175, 296–304; Spironelli, C., Angrilli, A., 2007. Influence of Phonological, Semantic and Orthographic tasks on the early linguistic components N150 and N350. International Journal of Psychophysiology 64, 190–198], we ran an experiment on three samples of subjects, 28 children (mean: 10 years), 22 young adults (23 years) and 20 middle-aged subjects (59 years). Subjects had to read the same sample of words in three blocked tasks, Orthographic, Phonological and Semantic, while EEG was recorded from 38 scalp locations. Analysis performed on N150 and four regions of interest/quadrants revealed typical significant left posterior negativity in young and aged subjects, but reversed lateralization and greater right negativity in children compared with the two adult groups. Analysis of the later N350 revealed a significant three-way group × laterality × task interaction, showing greater left negativity on the Phonological task only in the two adult groups, and a bilateral component in children. Results indicate that the functional lateralization of linguistic neural networks involved in automatic word recognition and in phonological processing is not yet developed in linguistically competent children aged 10 years, whereas the observed lateralization is relatively stable and not degraded in moderately aged subjects. Results are discussed in view of their implications for age-related linguistic pathologies."

About 70 children were followed from the end of kindergarten to the middle of grade 2. Correlation analyses were performed as well as a linear growth curve analyses. In the traditional regression analysis, phonemic awareness in kindergarten explained about 27% of the variance in word reading six months later and about 9.5% of the variance at the end of grade 1. Even when prior level of reading skill was included in the predictive equation, a significant amount of variance was still explained by phonemic awareness. The other predictor variables did not explain any variance in word reading, and phonemic awareness did not predict any variance in reading skills in grade 2. When using sentence reading as the dependent variable, phonemic awareness explained about 16% of unique variance after six months, and about 13% of the variance in the middle of grade 2. Similarly, when employing growth curve analysis, phonemic awareness was the only phonological factor that accounted for significant variance in the word reading slope, explaining about 25% of its variance, whereas naming and short-term memory did not explain any unique variance. The lack of predictive power of phonemic awareness on the sentence b-slope is assumed to be caused by unreliable sentence scores in kindergarten."

In order to examine the relationships among various phonological skills and reading comprehension, Latvian children were followed from grade 1 to grade 2 and were tested with a battery of phonological, word reading, and reading comprehension tasks. A principal component analysis of the phonological tasks revealed three salient factors: a phonemic awareness factor, a rapid naming factor, and a short-term memory factor. In order to analyze the relationship between various phonological skills and reading comprehension, a structural modeling analysis was performed. Phonemic awareness and rapid naming explained approximately the same amount of unique variance in reading comprehension, but phonemic awareness had most predictive power indirectly via word decoding. Only rapid naming had a significant direct impact on reading comprehension."

(2) How well do language deficits predict reading growth? and (3) How well does Verbal IQ-word reading discrepancy predict reading growth? Univariate analyses showed that Verbal IQ, phonological skills, orthographic skills, rapid automatized naming (RAN), and attention ratings predicted the response to early intervention, but multivariate analyses based on a combination of predictors for real-word reading and pseudoword reading showed that Verbal IQ was not the best unique predictor. Students with double or triple deficits in language skills (RAN, phonological, and orthographic processing) responded more slowly to early intervention than students without language deficits. Verbal IQ-word reading discrepancy did not predict the response to early intervention in reading. Overall results supported the use of reading-related language and attention measures rather than IQ-achievement discrepancy in identifying candidates for early reading intervention."

The results were interpreted as support for the notion that the executive system was an important predictor of age-related changes in problem solving beyond the contribution of math and reading skills, and this system operates independently of the phonological system and domain-specific knowledge in predicting solution accuracy."

Two ADHD groups (67 ADHD only; 21 ADHD + RD) and a control group of 27 healthy age-matched peers were compared on four variables: color naming speed, letter naming speed, phonologic decoding, and arithmetic computation. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was conducted to predict group membership. The four variables loaded onto two discriminant functions with good specificity: phonologic decoding, letter naming speed, and arithmetic defined the first function; color naming speed defined the second function. Both ADHD groups were significantly slower in color naming than controls, but did not differ from one another. DFA correctly classified 96% of the control group, 91% of ADHD + RD, and 82% of ADHD only. A subset of children in the ADHD groups participated subsequently in an acute, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with three single doses (10, 25, 20 mg) of methylphenidate. Methylphenidate selectively improved color-naming speed but had no effect on the speed of naming letters or digits. These findings challenge the tenet that naming speed deficits are specific to RD and implicate naming speed deficits associated with effortful semantic processing in ADHD, which are improved but not normalized by stimulant medication."

However, whether early screening for dyslexia is viable is not yet known. Methods: The study followed children at high risk of dyslexia from preschool through the early primary years assessing them from age 3 years and 6 months (T1) at approximately annual intervals on tasks tapping cognitive, language, and executive-motor skills. The children were recruited to three groups: children at family risk of dyslexia, children with concerns regarding speech, and language development at 3;06 years and controls considered to be typically developing. At 8 years, children were classified as ‘dyslexic’ or not. Logistic regression models were used to predict the individual risk of dyslexia and to investigate how risk factors accumulate to predict poor literacy outcomes. Results: Family-risk status was a stronger predictor of dyslexia at 8 years than low language in preschool. Additional predictors in the preschool years include letter knowledge, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, and executive skills. At the time of school entry, language skills become significant predictors, and motor skills add a small but significant increase to the prediction probability. We present classification accuracy using different probability cutoffs for logistic regression models and ROC curves to highlight the accumulation of risk factors at the individual level. Conclusions: Dyslexia is the outcome of multiple risk factors and children with language difficulties at school entry are at high risk. Family history of dyslexia is a predictor of literacy outcome from the preschool years. However, screening does not reach an acceptable clinical level until close to school entry when letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and RAN, rather than family risk, together provide good sensitivity and specificity as a screening battery."
START,START,2114120085,wots that werd pseudowords non words may be a misleading measure of phonological skills in young learner readers,2006,"brenda thomson, david p crewther, sheila g crewther",dyslexia,1,13,34,"Pseudoword (non-word) reading tasks are a commonly used measure of phonological processing across diverse fields of reading research. However, whether pseudoword reading gives any more information about phonological processing in young learner readers than does the reading of real words has seldom been considered. Here we show that pseudoword and real word reading are so strongly correlated (r = 0.94) in the first 4 years of school as to be representative of the same construct. Two of the subskills of phonological processing, phonological awareness and rapid automatic naming also predict almost identical amounts of variance in pseudoword and real word reading. A divergence in the correlations between word and pseudoword reading and phonological awareness and rapid naming only emerges in the fourth year, while a significant correlation between phonological awareness and rapid automatic naming is evident only in the first year of schooling. Thus these results suggest that, at least in young children learning to read, care should be taken when using pseudoword reading to measure either phonological processing ability or phonological awareness as this may misinform the choice of therapy for a child showing symptoms of dyslexia.

The data show that the group being diagnosed as poor readers were significantly behind in all reading and spelling measures. It was also found that the criterion measures of reading and spelling explained already two third of the variance associated with the group distinction. Finally, we found word and pseudoword efficiency in the typical group to be explained by phonological awareness (spoonerism) and rapid naming of letters, word and pseudoword accuracy by phonological awareness, and spelling by phonological awareness and letter dictation. In the group of poor readers, a much greater variety of precursor measures was involved in explaining the variance in reading and spelling abilities."

In reading efficiency, rapid automatized naming, and in reading and spelling accuracy phoneme deletion predicted children's responsiveness to intervention. Additionally, children's initial reading abilities at the start of the intervention directly (and indirectly, via initial treatment success, in reading efficiency) predicted posttest outcomes.

This expertise can be indexed by the N1 component of ERPs at the neural level. However, the nature of N1 tuning for print is controversial in terms of onset of the latency, lateralization and the neural mechanism of the N1. This study aimed to investigate whether two groups of Chinese children could discriminate characters/character-like stimuli from visual controls (i.e., coarse N1 tuning) and distinguish characters from character-like stimuli (i.e., fine N1 tuning). We also explored the cognitive-linguistic correlates of N1 tuning. Seventeen children in the younger group (M=7.7 years) and 13 in the older group (M=9.4 years) were all required to finish a character decision task with character, pseudocharacter, noncharacter, and stroke combination conditions using ERP testing. Both the pseudocharacters and noncharacters were unpronounceable, and the main difference between the two conditions was in orthographic presentation (i.e., radical position). Children were also administered measures of reading fluency, reading accuracy, RAN, phonological skill and vocabulary knowledge. ERP results showed that a significantly larger N1 was observed in the characters, pseudocharacters, and noncharacters as compared to the stroke combinations in both groups. The N1 for characters and pseudocharacters was also significantly larger than that for noncharacters in both groups. Both coarse and fine N1s were larger for younger children than for older children, and the N1 was bilateral in younger children, but left lateralized in older children. Correlational analyses showed that the coarse N1 tuning of real characters versus visual controls was moderately correlated with reading fluency and accuracy but not RAN, phonology, or vocabulary. Taken together, our study suggests that both coarse and fine N1 tuning occurs in both younger and older children, when performing character decisions. Under such task demands, orthography, rather than phonology or semantics, seems to be the driver of coarse N1 tuning for print in Chinese children."

Those in the resolving group had problems in language and cognitive skills only prior to school entry. In the late-emerging group, children showed clearly compromised rapid naming. Additionally, their parents had the most severe difficulties in rapid naming, a finding that suggests strong genetic liability. The findings show instability in the diagnosis of dyslexia. The members of the late-emerging group did not have a distinct early cognitive profile, so late-emerging dyslexia appears difficult to predict. Indeed, these children are at risk of not being identified and not receiving required support.

Finnish-speaking children (n = 1963) were assessed on reading fluency and spelling in grades 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The results indicated that the double dissociation groups could be identified even in the context of a highly transparent orthography: 41 children were unexpected poor spellers (SD), 36 were unexpected poor readers (RD), and 59 were poor in both reading and spelling (RSD). The RSD group performed poorest on all cognitive skills and showed the most task-avoidant behavior, the RD group performed poorly particularly on rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge, and the SD group had difficulties on phonological awareness and letter knowledge. Fathers’ shared book reading was less frequent in the RD and RSD groups than in the other groups. The findings suggest that there are discernible double dissociation groups with distinct cognitive profiles.

Letter knowledge was assessed longitudinally at ages 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.5 years; earlier language skills and environmental factors were assessed at ages 3.5 and 4.5 years; and reading achievement was assessed at the beginning and end of Grade 1. The analyses were conducted on a longitudinal data set involving children with and without familial risk for dyslexia. Emerging from the trajectory analysis of letter knowledge were 3 separate clusters: delayed (n = 63), linearly growing (n = 73), and precocious (n = 51). The members of the delayed cluster were predominantly children with familial risk for dyslexia, and the members of the precocious cluster were predominantly control group children. Phonological sensitivity, phonological memory, and rapid naming skills predicted delayed letter knowledge. Environmental predictors included level of maternal education and the amount of letter name teaching. Familial risk for dyslexia made a significant contribution to the predictive relations. Membership in the delayed cluster predicted poor reading performance at Grade 1."

The underlying biology of reading disability is poorly understood. However, the high correlation among RAN, RAS and reading could be attributable to shared genetic factors that contribute to common biological mechanisms. NA Objective NA To identify shared genetic factors that contribute to RAN and RAS performance using a multivariate approach. NA Methods NA We conducted a multivariate genome-wide association analysis of RAN Objects, RAN Letters and RAS Letters/Numbers in a sample of 1331 Hispanic American and African–American youth. Follow-up neuroimaging genetic analysis of cortical regions associated with reading ability in an independent sample and epigenetic examination of extant data predicting tissue-specific functionality in the brain were also conducted. NA Results NA Genome-wide significant effects were observed at rs1555839 (p=4.03×10 −8 ) and replicated in an independent sample of 318 children of European ancestry. Epigenetic analysis and chromatin state models of the implicated 70 kb region of 10q23.31 support active transcription of the gene NA RNLS NA in the brain, which encodes a catecholamine metabolising protein. Chromatin contact maps of adult hippocampal tissue indicate a potential enhancer–promoter interaction regulating NA RNLS NA expression. Neuroimaging genetic analysis in an independent, multiethnic sample (n=690) showed that rs1555839 is associated with structural variation in the right inferior parietal lobule. NA Conclusion NA This study provides support for a novel trait locus at chromosome 10q23.31 and proposes a potential gene–brain–behaviour relationship for targeted future functional analysis to understand underlying biological mechanisms for reading disability."

Strong evidence for a dyslexia susceptibility locus on chromosome 1p34-p36 (near marker D1S199) was recently reported, and an earlier study found suggestive evidence for linkage to the same region. We tested for the presence of a dyslexia gene in this region in a sample of 100 Canadian families using both qualitative and quantitative definitions of the phenotype. Using a qualitative definition of dyslexia (affected, unaffected, or uncertain), the largest multipoint Genehunter Maximum LOD-Score (MLS) in 100 core nuclear families was 3.65 at D1S507, distal to D1S199. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) linkage analysis was performed for four measures of dyslexia (phonological awareness, phonological coding, spelling, and rapid automatized naming speed) employing the variance components approach implemented in Genehunter. Using a model with QTL additive and dominance variance and polygenic additive variance, the multipoint LOD scores maximized proximal to D1S199 (between D1S552 and D1S1622), with peaks of 4.01 for spelling and 1.65 for phonological coding (corresponding LOD scores under 1 degree of freedom were 3.30 and 1.13, respectively).

We hypothesized that this shift should be reflected in a concomitant shift in reading-related cognitive functions. The current study investigated the cognitive dynamics underlying reading development in a large school sample ranging from beginning to experienced readers. The results showed that phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN) contributed substantially to reading fluency over all six primary school grades. However, the relationship between PA and word (but not pseudoword) reading fluency decreased as a function of reading experience, whereas the relationship between RAN and word reading fluency increased gradually. Moreover, this cognitive shift was most pronounced for high-frequency words. The results seem to point to the development of one (and only one) reading network for all types of words in which processing load or type of processing depends on word familiarity and amount of reading experience."

The current study investigated the main assumptions of this hypothesis in a large sample of well-diagnosed dyslexics. The three main findings were that (a) naming speed was consistently related only to reading speed; (b) phonological processing speed and naming speed loaded on the same factor, and this factor contributed strongly to reading speed; and (c) although general processing speed was involved in speeded naming of visual items, it did not explain the relationship between naming speed and reading speed. The results do not provide support for the existence of a second independent core naming deficit in dyslexia and indicate that speeded naming tasks are mainly phonological processing speed tasks with an important addition: fast cross-modal matching of visual symbols and phonological codes."

Participants (N = 196, 42 % girls) included familial risk (FR) children with and without dyslexia in Grade 3 and controls. First, we found impairments in phonological awareness, rapid naming, and letter knowledge in FR kindergartners with later dyslexia, and mild phonological-awareness deficits in FR kindergartners without subsequent dyslexia. These skills were better predictors of reading than arithmetic, except for rapid naming. Second, the literacy environment at home was comparable among groups. Third, having a dyslexic parent and literacy abilities of the non-dyslexic parent related to offspring risk of dyslexia. Parental literacy abilities might be viewed as indicators of offspring’s liability for literacy difficulties, since parents provide offspring with genetic and environmental endowment.

Previous studies with FR-children were inconclusive regarding the performance of FR-children without dyslexia as compared to the controls. Moreover, van Bergen et al. (2011) recently showed that FR-children with and without dyslexia differed in parental reading skills, suggesting that those who go on to develop dyslexia have a higher liability. The current study concerned 1) the comparison of three groups of children at the end of second grade and 2) the intergenerational transfer of reading and its underlying cognitive skills from parent to child. Method: Three groups of children were studied at the end of second grade: FR-dyslexia (n = 42), FR-no-dyslexia (n = 99), and control children (n = 66). Parents and children were measured on naming, phonology, spelling, and word and pseudoword reading. Results: The FR-dyslexia children were severely impaired across all tasks. The FR-no-dyslexia children performed better than the FR-dyslexia children, but still below the level of the controls on all tasks; the only exception was rapid naming (RAN), on which they were as fast as the controls. Focusing on the FR subsample, parental reading and RAN were related to their offspring's reading status. Conclusions: We replicated and extended van Bergen et al.'s study in showing that the FR-children who develop dyslexia are likely to have a higher liability. Both the group comparisons and the parent-child relations highlight the importance of good RAN skills for reading acquisition."

In kindergarten, the at-risk non-dyslexics performed better than the at-risk dyslexics, but worse than the controls on letter-knowledge and rapid naming. The groups did not differ on phonological awareness. At-risk dyslexics read less fluently from first grade onwards than the other groups. At-risk non-dyslexics' reading fluency was at an intermediate position between the other groups at the start of reading. By fifth grade they had reached a similar level as the controls on word reading, but still lagged behind on pseudoword reading. Results further showed that the parents of the groups of at-risk children differed in educational level and reading skills. Overall, the groups of at-risk children differed on pre-reading skills as well as on reading development. These differences do not seem to stem from differences in intellectual abilities or literacy environment. Instead, the better reading skills of parents of at-risk non-dyslexics suggest that these children might have a lower genetic liability."

It has been argued that this shift can be detected in the correlations between serial and discrete naming of alphanumeric symbols (digits and letters) and words. In the current study, we examined the relations between alphanumeric symbol naming and reading of monosyllabic and multisyllabic words and nonwords in two languages that differ in orthographic consistency: English and Dutch. A sample of 92 English-speaking Canadian children and 101 Dutch children, all in Grade 5, were assessed on discrete and serial naming of digits and letters and on serial and discrete naming of monosyllabic and multisyllabic words and nonwords. Results showed that discrete naming of alphanumeric symbols closely resembled discrete reading of monosyllabic words, suggesting that these words are processed in parallel in both languages. Both serial and parallel reading processes were found to underlie identification of multisyllabic words as well as monosyllabic nonwords. However, differences between the two languages emerged when processing multisyllabic nonwords. Whereas English-speaking children relied more on parallel reading processes to read multisyllabic nonwords, Dutch-speaking children processed these items serially.

The majority of these studies, however, focused on oral reading rather than on the more dominant silent reading mode. Similarly, it is common practice to assess oral reading abilities rather than silent reading abilities in schools and in diagnosis of reading impairments. More important, insights gained through examinations of oral reading tend to be generalized to silent reading. In the current study, we examined whether such generalizations are justified. We directly compared oral and silent reading fluency by examining whether these reading modes relate to the same underlying skills. In total, 132 fourth graders read words, sentences, and text orally, and 123 classmates read the same material silently. As underlying skills, we considered phonological awareness, rapid naming, and visual attention span. All skills correlated significantly with both reading modes. Phonological awareness contributed equally to oral and silent reading. Rapid naming, however, correlated more strongly with oral reading than with silent reading. Visual attention span correlated equally strongly with both reading modes but showed a significant unique contribution only to silent reading. In short, we showed that oral and silent reading indeed are fairly similar reading modes, based on the relations with reading-related cognitive skills. However, we also found differences that warrant caution in generalizing findings across reading modes."

The question of whether the genetically affected learning mechanism of children who are at familial risk (FR) of developing dyslexia could be influenced by training phoneme awareness and letter-sound associations in the prereading phase was investigated. The rationale was that intervention studies reveal insights about the weaknesses of the learning mechanisms of FR children. In addition, the studies aimed to gather practical insights to be used in the development of a system of early diagnosis and prevention. Focused on the last period of kindergarten before formal reading instruction starts in Grade 1, intervention methods with comparable samples and designs but differences in delivery mode (use of computer or manual), tutor (semi-professional or parent), location (at school or at home), and additional practices (serial rapid naming or simple word reading) have been executed to test the hypothesis that the incidence and degree of dyslexia can be reduced. The present position paper summarizes the Dutch Dyslexia Programme findings and relates them to findings of other studies. It is discussed that the Dutch studies provide evidence on why prevention of dyslexia is hard to accomplish. It is argued that effective intervention should not only start early but also be adapted to the individual and often long-lasting educational needs of children at risk of reading failure."

In the longitudinal project of the Dutch Dyslexia Programme, 180 children with a familial risk of dyslexia (FR) and a comparison group of 120 children without FR (noFR) were followed from the age of 2 months up to 9 years. Children were assessed on (1) auditory, speech, and visual event-related potentials every half year between 2 and 41 months; (2) expressive and receptive language, motor development, behaviour problems, and home-literacy environment by questionnaires at the age of 2 and 3; (3) speech-language and cognitive development from 47 months onwards; and (4) preliteracy and subskills of reading, and reading development during kindergarten and Grades 2 and 3. With regard to precursors of reading disability, first analyses showed specific differences between FR and noFR children in neurophysiological, cognitive, and early language measures. Once reading tests administered from age 7 to 9 years were available, the children were divided into three groups: FR children with and without dyslexia, and controls. Analyses of the differences between reading groups yielded distinct profiles and developmental trajectories. On early speech and visual processing, and several cognitive measures, performance of the non-dyslexic FR group differed from the dyslexic FR group and controls, indicating continuity of the influence of familial risk. Parental reading and rapid naming skills appeared to indicate their offspring's degree of familial risk. Furthermore, on rapid naming and nonverbal IQ, the non-dyslexic FR group performed similarly to the controls, suggesting protective factors. There are indications of differences between the FR and control groups, irrespective of reading outcome. These results contribute to the distinction between the deficits correlated to dyslexia as a manifest reading disorder and deficits correlated to familial risk only."

Method Parent questionnaires concerning aspects of the HLE were used to investigate differences between 48 children with ID, 107 children without disabilities of the same chronological age and 36 children without disabilities of the same mental age (MA). Furthermore, for the children with ID, corre- lations were computed between aspects of the HLE and children's non-verbal intelligence, speech intel- ligibility, language and early literacy skills. Results and conclusions From the results of the mul- tivariate analyses of variance it could be concluded that the HLE of children with ID differed from that of children in the chronological age group on almost all aspects. When compared with children in the MA group, differences in the HLE remained. However, differences mainly concerned child- initiated activities and not parent-initiated activities. Correlation analyses showed that children's activi- ties with literacy materials were positively related with MA, productive syntax and vocabulary age, and book orientation skills. Also, children's involve- ment during storybook reading was related with their MA, receptive language age, productive syntax and vocabulary age, book orientation and rapid naming of pictures. The amount of literacy materi- als parents provided was related to a higher produc- tive syntax age and level of book orientation of the children. Parent play activities were also positively related to children's speech intelligibility. The cogni- tive disabilities of the children were the main cause of the differences found in the HLE between chil- dren with ID and children without disabilities.

We compared such groups of German dyslexic primary school children to each other and with good reading children in a phoneme deletion task performed during fMRI scanning. Children heard German words or pseudowords and repeated the remainder of the stimulus while deleting the initial phoneme (e.g. tear – _ear). In four conditions, the input stimulus (word or pseudoword) could either become another word or pseudoword as output. The word-word condition stuck out against all other conditions involving pseudowords: Dyslexics with a double deficit showed a strong response in left areas 44 and 45 in Boca’s region, whereas dyslexics with rapid naming difficulties revealed a contralateral effect in right areas 44 and 45. These findings, which were obtained without presenting written or pictorial stimuli, reveal that a double deficit in dyslexia is not the sum of single deficits, but rather involves the interaction of lexical and phonological processing, making strong demands on the left inferior frontal cortex. In general, the results stress the importance of considering subtypes of dyslexia differentially in order to obtain better insights in the neurocognitive mechanisms of impaired and successful reading."

This allowed us to investigate the persistence of dyslexia in the first language (L1) and the effect of dysleda on the second language (L2), which has, in this case, a lower orthographic transparency. Furthermore, the inclusion of the HRnonDys group allowed us to investigate the continuity of the familial risk of dyslexia, as previous studies observed that the HRnonDys group often scores in between the HRDys and LRnonDys group, and whether these readers without reading deficits in Dutch, have more reading difficulties in ESL. Methods. The data of three groups of adolescents were analyzed; 27 LRnonDys, 25 HRDys 25 HRnonDys. The mean age was 14;1 years; months, and 37 were male. All were native speakers lof Dutch, attended regular secondary education (grade 7 10), and were non-native speakers of English. Using MANOVA the groups were compared on Dutch and English word reading fluency (WRF), spelling and vocabulary, Dutch pseudoword and Iloanword reading fluency, phonological awareness (PA), rapid automatized naming (RAN), and verbal short term and working memory. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare English and Dutch WRF, spelling and vocabulary directly within the three groups. Results. The analyses revealed that the HRDys group had a deficit in both reading and spelling in Dutch and ESL. They also performed poorer than the LRnonDys group on all other measures. Effect sizes were especially large for pseudoword reading and the reaction times during the PA task. The HRnonDys group scored generally poorer than the LRnonDys group but this difference was only significant for Dutch pseudoword reading, PA reaction times and verbal short term memory. In general the HRDys and HRnonDys group scored similar in Dutch and English, except for English WRF where the HRDys group scored slightly better than expected based on their Dutch WRF. Discussion There was a high persistence of dyslexia. Adolescents with dyslexia ad large impairments in reading and spelling, and reading related measures, both in Dutch and ESL. Despite high inter-individual differences, an overall three-step pattern was observed. Adolescents in the HRnonDys group scored in between the HRDys and LRnonDys group, supporting the polygenetic origin of dyslexia and the continuity of the familial risk of dyslexia. The lower orthographic transparency did not have a negative effect on L2 reading, spelling and vocabulary, both in the HRnonDys and HRDys group. The latter group performed slightly better than expected in L2, which may be a result of the massive exposure to English and high motivation to use English by adolescents."

These patterns were essentially replicated in a third study that used some of the same semantic and phonological measures used in the first experiment, and verbal and visual-verbal learning tasks that employed word lists and visual stimuli (novel alphabetic characters) that more closely approximated those used in learning to read. It was concluded that semantic coding deficits are an unlikely cause of reading difficulties in most poor readers at the beginning stages of reading skills acquisition, but accrue as a consequence of prolonged reading difficulties in older readers. It was also concluded that phonological coding deficits are a probable cause of reading difficulties in most poor readers."

Such variability sets limitations on the extent to which conclusions may be drawn with respect to the double-deficit hypothesis. Furthermore, the literature is complicated by the persistent finding that measures of phonological processing and naming speed are significantly correlated, resulting in a statistical artifact that makes it difficult to disentangle the influence of naming speed from that of phonological processing.

Since most of the work on naming speed has been undertaken within the framework of reading research, however, the extent to which poor RAN is specifically associated with RD or with learning impairment (LI) in general is uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that slow naming speed is specific to RD. Participants were 188 children (ages 7 to 11) referred for evaluation of learning problems. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the utility of the RAN task for classifying children in diagnostic groups. RAN was an excellent tool for detecting risk for learning problems in general, but it was much less effective at distinguishing LI children with and without RD from each other."

There were high correlations between both discrete and sequential hiragana reading and sentence reading, suggesting that some mechanism which automatizes hiragana reading makes sentence reading fluent. In object and color tasks, there were moderate correlations between sentence reading and sequential naming, and between sequential naming and discrete naming. But no correlation was found between reading tasks and discrete naming tasks. The influence of rapid naming ability of objects and colors upon reading seemed relatively small, and multi-item processing may work in relation to these. In contrast, in the digit naming task there was moderate correlation between sentence reading and discrete naming, while no correlation was seen between sequential naming and discrete naming. There was moderate correlation between reading tasks and sequential digit naming tasks. Digit rapid naming ability has more direct effect on reading while its effect on RAN is relatively limited. The ratio of how rapid naming ability influences RAN and reading seems to vary according to kind of the stimuli used. An assumption about components in RAN which influence reading is discussed in the context of both sequential processing and discrete naming speed."

For event-related potentials (ERPs), children with ADHD showed a reduced target-evoked N2pc component, which predicted their poorer RAN performance. However, in TD children the early occipital P1 amplitude was negatively correlated with their RAN performance.

Recent advances in the genetic underpinnings of reading disability have indicated that the heritable, familial risk for dyslexia is a major risk factor. The present data-driven, classification attempt aims to revisit the possibility of identifying distinct cognitive deficit profiles in a large sample of second to fourth grade reading disabled children. In this sample, we investigated whether genetic and environmental risk factors are able to distinguish between poor reader subtypes. In this profile, we included reading-related measures of phonemic awareness, letter-speech sound processing and rapid naming, known as candidate vulnerability markers associated with dyslexia and familial risk for dyslexia, as well as general cognitive abilities (non-verbal IQ and vocabulary). Clustering was based on a 200 multi-start K-means approach. Results revealed four emerging subtypes of which the first subtype showed no cognitive deficits underlying their poor reading skills (Reading-only impaired poor readers). The other three subtypes shared a core phonological deficit (PA) with a variable and discriminative expression across the other underlying vulnerability markers. More specific, type 2 showed low to poor performance across all reading-related and general cognitive abilities (general poor readers), type 3 showed a specific letter-speech sound mapping deficit next to a PA deficit (PA-LS specific poor readers) and type 4 showed a specific rapid naming deficit complementing their phonological weakness (PA-RAN specific poor readers). The first three poor reader profiles were more characterized by variable environmental risk factor, while the fourth, PA-RAN poor reader subtype showed a significantly strong familial risk for dyslexia. Overall, when we zoom in on the heterogeneous phenomenon of reading disability, unique and distinct cognitive subtypes can be identified, distinguishing between those poor readers more influences by the role of genes and those more influenced by environmental risk factors. Taking into account this diversity of distinct cognitive subtypes, instead of looking at the reading disabled sample as a whole, will help tailor future diagnostic and intervention efforts more specifically to the needs of children with such a specific deficit and risk pattern, as well as providing a more promising way forward for genetic studies of dyslexia."

This suggests that dyslexics encounter local processing difficulties, which presumably induce a narrower perceptual span. Consequently, dyslexics should suffer less than normal readers from removing parafoveal preview. Here we used a gaze-contingent moving window paradigm in a RAN task to experimentally test this prediction. Results indicate that dyslexics extract less parafoveal information than control children. We propose that more attentional resources are recruited to the foveal processing because of dyslexics' less automatized translation of visual symbols into phonological output, thereby causing a reduction of the perceptual span. This in turn leads to less efficient preactivation of parafoveal information and, hence, more difficulty in processing the next foveal item."

Three groups of 15 children each—those with dyslexia, age-matched (AM) controls, and reading-matched (RM) controls—participated. Dyslexia was diagnosed at 8 years of age. All children were tested on phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming (RAN), morphological awareness, word reading, and vocabulary knowledge in both Chinese and English and also speed of processing skill. AM controls outperformed the group with dyslexia on all measures except for phonological awareness, English word reading, and vocabulary. However, those with dyslexia and AM controls developed at a similar rate across all reading-related skills from 6 to 8 years of age. Compared with the RM controls, the group with dyslexia scored higher in phonological awareness, morphological awareness, and vocabulary knowledge in both Chinese and English and also in English word reading but scored similarly in RAN. Children with dyslexia, thus, manifested clear difficulties in Chinese vocabulary knowledge, morphological awareness, and RAN as well as general speed of processing, representing a developmental lag in cognitive skills. Among these, RAN deficits are likely to be the most severe deficits in Chinese children with dyslexia."

Results from a sample of 1,265 children in Grade 2 showed that phonological awareness was the main factor associated with reading performance in each language.

Interventions, remedial and prophylactic, are needed to mitigate reading and other learning difficulties faced by survivors. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted to investigate long-term effects of a prophylactic reading intervention administered during radiation therapy in children treated for medulloblastoma. The fMRI study included 19 reading-intervention (age 11.7 ± 0.6 years) and 21 standard-of-care (age 12.1 ± 0.6 years) medulloblastoma survivors, and 21 typically developing children (age 12.3 ± 0.6 years). The survivors were 2.5 [1.2, 5.4] years after completion of tumor therapies and reading-intervention survivors were 2.9 [1.6, 5.9] years after intervention. Five fMRI tasks (Rapid Automatized Naming, Continuous Performance Test using faces and letters, orthographic and phonological processing of letter pairs, implicit word reading, and story reading) were used to probe reading-related neural activation. Woodcock-Johnson Reading Fluency, Word Attack, and Sound Awareness subtests were used to evaluate reading abilities. At the time of fMRI, Sound Awareness scores were significantly higher in the reading-intervention group than in the standard-of-care group (p = 0.046). Brain activation during the fMRI tasks was detected in left inferior frontal, temporal, ventral occipitotemporal, and subcortical regions, and differed among the groups (p < 0.05, FWE). The pattern of group activation differences, across brain areas and tasks, was a normative trend in the reading-intervention group. Standardized reading scores and patterns of brain activation provide evidence of long-term effects of prophylactic reading intervention in children treated for medulloblastoma."

Participants were briefly exposed to behavioral information implying a specific goal and were then given the opportunity to act on the goal in a different way and context. Studies 1–3 established the goal contagion phenomenon by showing that the behavioral consequences of goal contagion possess features of goal directedness: (a) They are affected by goal strength, (b) they have the quality of goal appropriateness, and (c) they are characterized by persistence. Studies 4 – 6 show that people do not automatically adopt goals when the observed goal pursuit is conducted in an unacceptable manner, because the goal will then be perceived as unattractive. The results are discussed in the context of recent research on automatic goal pursuits. The fact that social animals, and especially humans, go beyond the information given to grasp other animals’ goals fascinates researchers from many different disciplines, perhaps because this ability allows people to flexibly adjust to their social surroundings. Although realizing that someone is trying to be nice to one is informative, understanding the goal behind this behavior is much more so (e.g., the person may be trying to obtain a favor, wants to collaborate, has a sexual interest, etc.). Others’ goals tell us a lot about the motivational reasons for their behavior, and these, in turn, may determine our own goal-directed actions toward them. Specifically, in everyday social encounters, an appreciation of the goals that guide others’ actions allows one to entertain similar goals and to try to attain them for oneself—for the sake of personal as well as social needs (Byrne & Russon, 1998; Tomasello, Kruger, & Ratner, 1993).

Design: Randomized controlled trial with 379 female college students measured at 6 monthly time points. Main Outcome Measure: Self-reported indoor tanning frequency. Results: The intervention was effective at decreasing tanning over the period between the fall and spring. Longitudinal latent class analysis found 3 patterns of tanners among the treatment individuals: abstainers, moderate tanners, and heavy tanners. These classes appeared in both the treatment and control conditions, and the intervention had a harm reduction effect by reducing levels of exposure within the moderate and heavy tanner classes. Participant age and self-reported tanning patterns were found to be predictive of class membership. Conclusions: This research suggests that brief intervention approaches can be effective at reducing risk for skin cancer and illustrates several ways in which these protective effects can be enhanced."

Across 5 studies, we find that victims underestimate how much transgressors desire forgiveness. This is driven by a 2-part mediating mechanism: First, victims are more likely than transgressors to see the transgression as intentional, and second, this causes victims to believe transgressors feel less guilty than transgressors report feeling. Ultimately, this chain of asymmetries stymies the processes of forgiveness because victims tend to withhold forgiveness from those who actually desire it. The predicted effect emerged in the context of scenario studies (Studies 3 and 5), a real transgression that occurred in the lab (Study 4), transgressions from participants’ pasts (Study 1), and transgressions from the same day (Study 2). In Study 4, we describe a new procedure in which 1 participant commits a real transgression against another participant, providing an effective means for researchers to study real-time transgressions from the perspective of both parties involved. Furthermore, in Study 5, we found that when victims were encouraged to empathize with the transgressor, the asymmetries were attenuated, suggesting a means of overcoming this impediment to forgiveness.

Three historical periods are identified. The main topics are knowledge of results, distribution of practice, transfer of training, retention, and individual differences in motor learning. Basic research is emphasized, but applied research is included also. The article concludes with projections for the future that are based on past research and the present research climate. Why review nearly a century of research on motor skills? A good experiment can result from bouncing off the last one or a small subset of experiments in the literature, so why bother with the panorama? Any good scientific question always seems to have a long story. Perceptive investigators see the key variables and issues of a scientific topic early, and the generations that follow persist in efforts to understand those variables and issues. The first answer to my question, then, is that a sense of history helps an investigator lock onto important themes. Experiments enriched by history could contribute to the science rather than only brightening an inconsequential corner. Second, a sense of history tends to shunt an investigator away from the fads and fashions of his or her field. Fads and fashions are those inconsequential corners that are temporarily magnified out of proportion and that draw the energy of investigators who either have not seen the worth of persisting themes or who allow themselves to be turned from them. Third, the canons of scholarship are based on history because they require that (a) the origins of ideas be known so that one's own ideas are in perspective and, (b) earlier experiments be known so that the knowledge increment in one's own empirical findings is clear. My aim is to organize variables and issues for learning, retention, and transfer that have regularly attracted investigators of human motor skills, and to discuss the experiments that have been done to understand them. The last historical review of human motor skills was by Irion (1966). My review differs from Irion's in that I cover more material, have a different perspective, and update developments in the field.

Forty-seven adults wrote rich personal narratives prior to beginning psychotherapy and after every session over 12 assessment points while concurrently completing a measure of mental health. Narratives were coded for the themes of agency and coherence, which capture the dual aims of narrative identity: purpose and unity. By applying in- depth thematic coding to the stories of participants, the present study produced 47 case studies of intraindividual personality development and mental health. By employing multilevel modeling with the entire set of nearly 600 narratives, the present study also identified robust trends of individual differences in narrative changes as they related to improvements in mental health. Results indicated that, across participants, the theme of agency, but not coherence, increased over the course of time. In addition, increases in agency were related to improvements in participants’ mental health. Finally, lagged growth curve models revealed that changes in the theme of agency occurred prior to the associated improvements in mental health.

In the theory, it is hypothesized that behavioral orientations elicited by specific patterns of intergroup relationships (goal compatibility, relative power, and relative status) give rise to unique schematic representations of an out-group. The representations specified in the theory include 1 positive image (i.e., ally) and 3 differentiated negative images (i.e., enemy, dependent, barbarian). In all 3 experiments, participants read and imagined scenarios describing an intergroup situation in which the structure of relationships between in-group and out-group was varied. Results from Experiments 1 and 2 indicated that relationship cues were sufficient to elicit the predicted images, and some of the images were more likely to be activated under high incidental arousal. In a 3rd experiment an implicit measure was used to demonstrate that the images are activated spontaneously. Overall, results implicate the role of affective state and behavioral intent in shaping the content of social stereotypes."

As a result of cluster-analytic procedures, 3 distinct groups of participants emerged at pretest, and 4 emerged at posttest. One of the profiles that remained fairly consistent from pretest to posttest was the Learning-Oriented cluster. Students fitting this profile began the semester with the highest means in interest and strategic processing and with a moderate level of domain knowledge. By the end of the semester, this cluster obtained the highest means also on the domain knowledge test Yet, the largest cluster at posttest seemed unable or unwilling to learn from demanding exposition. In the last decade, the research on individual differences has moved toward the exploration of intraindividual variabilities (Ackerman, Kyllonen, & Roberts, in press). That is to say, researchers have become increasingly concerned with how cognitive and noncognitive factors, such as knowledge and self-regulation, configure differently within individuals (Ackerman, Kanfer, & Goff, 1995). Our purpose in this study was to explore such intraindividual diiferences by examining the various learner profiles that emerged within one classroom. Specifically, we wanted to ascertain whether undergraduates enrolled in an educational psychology course would naturally form into distinctive clusters based on their academic characteristics. We formed these clusters from information on students' subject matter knowledge, interests, and strategic processing. Because they were constructed by means of cluster analysis, the resulting profiles encompassed not only multiple indicators for each student but also data from every participating student."

The basis for categorizing responses in both studies was a 7-level hierarchical response model proposed by P. A. Alexander (1990). Cross-study results provided support for the response categories and for their hierarchical nature, Study 1 indicated that students' answers to analogies were nonrandom in that there were within-subject error preferences. In Study 2, student responses reflected training in domain concepts and strategic processes, and the direction of changes matched expectations of the ordered hierarchical response scheme."

TF-CBT is a manualized intervention with demonstrated efficacy in numerous clinical trials for children and adolescents who experienced various traumatic events. In the current study, an adapted form of TF-CBT for use with traumatic grief is utilized and other evidence-based practices are integrated into treatment in light of clinical events. This article describes the use of an intervention developed to treat children who have experienced traumatic events and devel- oped posttraumatic stress and other behavioral difficulties as a result. Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT; Cohen, Mannarino, & Deblinger, 2006) is a manualized interven- tion based on cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, and family models of treating traumatic stress. The standard intervention is conducted over 12 to 16 sessions and includes the core compo- nents of: psychoeducation and parenting skills, relaxation skills, affect modulation skills, cognitive processing, gradual exposure to the traumatic event through the development of a trauma narrative, in vivo desensitization, conjoint child-parent sessions, and enhanc- ing personal safety. The structure of the TF-CBT protocol allows the child to understand reactions to trauma and develop appropri- ate coping skills before developing a narrative of the trauma that desensitizes the child to reminders and allows for the cognitive restructuring of maladaptive thoughts. TF-CBT is typically con- ducted with the child and parent progressing separately, although simultaneously, through each of the components and coming to- gether in the conjoint child-parent session near the end of treat- ment to allow the child to share his or her narrative with the caregiver. TF-CBT was originally developed to treat posttraumatic stress and associated behavioral and emotional problems resulting from the experience of sexual abuse (Cohen & Mannarino, 1996; De- blinger, McLeer, & Henry, 1990).

The purpose of this study was to examine the role of executive functions in explaining the serial superiority effect. One hundred seven Grade 6 Greek children were assessed on serial and discrete naming (digits, objects, and words), executive (inhibition, shifting, and updating) and non-executive tasks (simple choice reaction), and on a serial Rapid Alternating Stimuli task. Reading fluency correlated more strongly with serial naming than with discrete naming, consistent with the serial superiority effect. In hierarchical regression analyses, executive measures failed to account for variance shared between serial naming and reading fluency. In confirmatory factor analyses, including a discrete and a serial factor for the naming tasks, variance in the executive tasks not shared with simple choice reaction was not associated with the serial factor. Thus, the executive tasks failed to account for the serial superiority effect. The high correlation between the simple choice factor and the discrete naming factor suggests that method variance partially underlies the observed relationship between executive function tasks and word reading. We argue that the distinction between serial and discrete dimensions indicates that internally regulated cognitive control is crucial for the serial superiority in naming symbols and words."

Each type of content was presented in two presentation formats: multiple stimulus displays (i.e., serial naming) and isolated stimulus displays (i.e., discrete naming). Serial tasks yielded faster naming rates—irrespective of task content—in both languages. However, content-specific characteristics influenced the trajectory of the serial advantage between grades. Improvement in the serial advantage between grades was found to be greatest for word reading, which started off similar to object naming in Grade 1, but ended up similar to digit or dice naming by Grade 5. In addition, growth in serial advantage was found to be associated with growth in discrete naming rate only in grade level analysis. For individuals, greater serial advantage was found to rely on processing skills specific to serial naming rather than on differences in the rate of naming isolated items. Our findings suggest that group level findings may not generalize to individuals, and although practice and familiarity with the content on the naming/reading task may impact the development of serial advantage, isolated item identification processes contribute little to individual differences in the gain in serial naming rates."

As expected, participants emphasized wrongfulness when choosing an appropriate criminal punishment. In Study 2, 33 Princeton undergraduates made similar ratings for violations of the University Honor Code, and rated their contempt for fabricated amendments to the Code that required sentencers to focus either only on harmfulness or only on wrongfulness. Again, sentences more closely reflected wrongfulness ratings, and participants were more contemptuous of the harmfulness-based proposal.

However, as these IMs challenge typical (and problematic) ways of acting, feeling, and thinking, they may also generate discrepancy or uncertainty. Clients may reduce uncertainty by returning to the problematic self-narrative immediately after the emergence of an IM, thus ensuring the homeostasis of the previous meaning system. This cyclical movement is a form of ambivalence, which can maintain problematic stability across therapy and lead to therapeutic failure. In this study, we identified return to the problem markers (RPMs), which are empirical indicators of the ambivalence process, for all IMs in two cases of constructivist grief psychotherapy. Both cases evidenced a high percentage of IMs with RPMs, and the evolution of IMs and RPMs along treatment was significantly correlated. We suggest that stability of the ambivalence process in grief psychotherapy may represent a form of self-protection from the anxiety or guilt of releasing pain as a disconnection from the deceased."

One of the foremost components of phonological processing is rapid automatized naming (RAN)- the ability to identify and recognize a given item by the activation and concomitant articulation of its name. Objective: To assess the RAN performance of schoolchildren with dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared with their peers. Methods: In total, 70 schoolchildren aged between 8‒11 years participated in the study. Of these, 16 children had a multiprofessional diagnosis of ADHD while 14 had been diagnosed with dyslexia. Matched with these groups, 40 schoolchildren with no history of developmental impairments were also evaluated. The RAN test was administered to assess the length of time required to name a series of familiar visual stimuli. The statistical analysis was conducted using measures of descriptive statistics and the 2-sample t-test at the 5% significance level. Results: The performance of the group with dyslexia was inferior to that of the control group, in all tasks and the ADHD group had inferior performance for color and letters-naming tasks. The schoolchildren with dyslexia and those with ADHD showed very similar response times. Age has shown to be an important variable to be analyzed separately. Children with typical language development have faster answers as they aged on colors and digits tasks while children with dyslexia or ADHD do not show improvement with age. Conclusions: The schoolchildren with dyslexia took longer to complete all tasks and ADHD took longer to complete digits and objects tasks in comparison to their peers with typical development. This ability tends to improve with age, which is not the case, however, with schoolchildren who have ADHD or dyslexia."

Typically developing 3rd (n = 117) and 5th (n = 103) graders completed the RAS task. Instead of analyzing RAN/RAS results the usual way (total time), growth mixture modeling assessed trajectories of successive times for naming 10 symbols in each of five rows. For all three samples and both RAN and RAS, two latent classes were identified. The “faster” class performed slowly on the first row and increased time by small increments on subsequent rows. The “slower” latent class performed more slowly on the first row, and children, but not adults, increased time by larger increments on subsequent rows. For children, both the initial row (automaticity index) and slope (sustained controlled processing index) of the trajectory differentiated the classes. For adults, only the initial row separated the classes. The longest time was on row 3 for RAN and row 4 for RAS. For the typically developing 5th graders, close in age to the children with dyslexia, the trajectories were flatter than for children with dyslexia and only the slower class (4%) showed the peak on row 4. For children with dyslexia, inhibition predicted RAN slope within the slower latent class and phonological working memory predicted RAS slope for both latent classes. For adults with dyslexia, inhibition and phonological working memory differentiated both latent classes on RAN intercept and RAS slope. Taken together, RAN, which may assess the phonological loop of working memory, and RAS, which may assess the central executive in working memory, may explain the timing deficit in dyslexia in sustaining coordinated orthographic-phonological processing over time."

Two years later, children were interviewed regarding their perceptions of social support and their attributions about others' intentions. Also assessed at Time 2 were child verbal intelligence, defensive response style, children's self-reports, and parent reports of child adjustment. As expected, attachment uniquely predicted perceived social support. Insecure attachment predicted self-reports of behavior problems and parental report of internalizing problems. Perceived social support was associated positively and significantly with viewing ambiguously depicted actions as prosocial rather than aggressive. Perceived social support was found to mediate the relation between attachment and adjustment. Results suggest that behaviorally mediated strategies for relating to caregivers in early childhood predict generalized social perception, thought, and emotion at later ages."

Studies 1 through 3 found overconfidence leads to higher social status in both short and longer-term groups, using naturalistic and experimental designs. Study 4 applied a Brunswikian (1956) lens analysis and found that overconfidence leads to a behavioral signature that makes the individual appear competent to others. Studies 5 and 6 measured and experimentally manipulated the desire for status and found that the status motive promotes overconfidence. Together, these studies suggest that people might so often believe they are better than others because it helps them achieve higher social status."

VAS (i.e., the number of visual elements that can be processed at once in a multi-element array) was tested with a visual 1-back task and RAN was measured in a serial letter naming task that introduced a novel manipulation (some letter sequences formed frequent words). Spanish-Basque and French-Basque bilingual children were tested at early (30 children in 1st and 2nd grade), and more advanced (24 children in 3rd, 4th and 5th grade) stages of reading acquisition to investigate whether they would be differently biased towards multi-letter processing due to reading in two shallow (Spanish, Basque), or a deep and a shallow (French, Basque) orthography. The French-Basque bilinguals, who read in a deep orthography, were expected to rely on larger orthographic units in reading and thus to be more biased towards multi-letter processing in both tasks. This was expected to be reflected by: (a) a uniform distribution of attention across letter strings in the VAS task, and (b) a greater interference of the embedded words on letter-by-letter naming in RAN, leading to longer naming times. The expected group differences were observed in the more advanced readers, with French-Basque bilinguals showing a wider distribution of VAS across letter strings and longer naming times in RAN."

Sixty-two kindergarten children were read 12 storybook “chapters” while their eye movements were tracked. Results indicated that the children quickly acquired initial mental graphemic representations of target nonwords. This learning occurred even though they focused on the target nonwords approximately one fourth of the total time while viewing the pages. Their ability to acquire the initial orthographic representations of the target nonwords and their viewing time was affected by the linguistic statistical regularities of the words. The results provide evidence of orthographic learning during structured storybook reading and for the use of implicit linguistic statistical regularities for learning new orthographic word forms in the early stages of reading development.

In this study, we assessed the phonemic awareness, morphological awareness, orthographic awareness, receptive vocabulary, and rapid naming abilities of second and third grade students (N = 56) and determined how these abilities predicted the children’s reading and spelling skills. Regression analyses revealed that morphological awareness was the sole unique contributor to spelling and, together with orthographic awareness, uniquely contributed to word recognition. Morphological awareness also was significantly related to reading comprehension. The results add to a growing literature base providing evidence that early literacy development is influenced by morphological awareness, an ability that has received considerably less educational attention.

Children fail critical tests of belief reasoning before 3 to 4 years of age (H. Wellman, D. Cross, & J. Watson, 2001; H. Wimmer & J. Perner, 1983), yet infants apparently pass false-belief tasks at 13 or 15 months (K. H. Onishi & R. Baillargeon, 2005; L. Surian, S. Caldi, & D. Sperber, 2007). Nonhuman animals also fail critical tests of belief reasoning but can show very complex social behavior (e.g., J. Call & A Tomasello, 2005). Fluent social interaction in adult humans implies efficient processing of beliefs, yet direct tests suggest that belief reasoning is cognitively demanding, even for adults (e.g., I. A. Apperly, D. Samson, & G. W. Humphreys, 2009). The authors interpret these findings by drawing an analogy with the domain of number cognition, where similarly contrasting results have been observed. They propose that the success of infants and nonhuman animals on some belief reasoning tasks may be best explained by a cognitively efficient but inflexible capacity for tracking belief-like states. In humans, this capacity persists in parallel with a later-developing, more flexible but more cognitively demanding theory-of-mind abilities."

In the current study, we investigated the validity of this hypothesis for Portuguese orthography, which is more consistent than English orthography, by exploring different cognitive profiles in a sample of dyslexic children. In particular, we were interested in identifying readers characterized by a pure rapid automatized naming deficit. We also examined whether rapid naming and phonological awareness independently account for individual differences in reading performance. We characterized the performance of dyslexic readers and a control group of normal readers matched for age on reading, visual rapid naming and phonological processing tasks. Our results suggest that there is a subgroup of dyslexic readers with intact phonological processing capacity (in terms of both accuracy and speed measures) but poor rapid naming skills. We also provide evidence for an independent association between rapid naming and reading competence in the dyslexic sample, when the effect of phonological skills was controlled. Altogether, the results are more consistent with the view that rapid naming problems in dyslexia represent a second core deficit rather than an exclusive phonological explanation for the rapid naming deficits. Furthermore, additional non-phonological processes, which subserve rapid naming performance, contribute independently to reading development."

The test consisted of a 20-minute training aimed at learning eight basic letter–speech sound correspondences within an artificial orthography, followed by a short assessment of both mastery of these correspondences and word reading ability in this unfamiliar script. Fifty-five (7- to 11-year-old) children diagnosed with dyslexia engaged in specialized intervention during approximately 10 months and their reading and spelling abilities were assessed before and after. Our results indicated that the dynamic test predicted variance in reading skills at posttest, over and above traditional static measures, such as phonological awareness and rapid naming. These findings indicate that responsiveness to learning new letter–speech sound correspondences has a prognostic value for the success of specialized reading intervention."

Methods: An epidemiological sample (n = 374) of school-aged children completed standardized tests of language, intelligence, and short-term and working memory, as well as nonstandardized measures of grammaticality judgment, rapid naming, and sentence recall. Results: Results of a principal component analysis revealed 4 factors corresponding to domain-general working memory, language processing, phonological short-term memory, and fluid reasoning. In corresponding analyses based on younger and older halves of the data, more variables loaded on the fluid reasoning factor for the younger group, and more task variance was explained by the language or phonological storage factors for the older group.

Drawing on the notion that cultural mindset influences the cognitive process individuals bring to bear at the moment of judgment, we propose that the congruency between the cultural mindset (individualistic vs. collectivistic) and problem type (rule-based vs. context-based) affects success in problem-solving. In 7 studies we incorporated the traditional approach to studying the impact of culture (i.e., comparing cultural groups) with contemporary approaches viewing cultural differences in a more dynamic and malleable manner. We first show that members of an individualistic group (Jewish Americans) perform better on rule-based problems, whereas members of collectivistic groups (ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arabs from Israel) perform better on context-based problems (Study 1). We then study Arabs in Israel using language (Arabic vs. Hebrew) to prime their collectivistic versus individualistic mindsets (Study 2). As hypothesized, among biculturals (those who internalize both cultures) Arabic facilitated solving context-based problems, whereas Hebrew facilitated solving rule-based problems. We follow up with 5 experiments priming the cultural mindset of individualism versus collectivism, employing various manifestations of the cultural dimension: focusing on the individual versus the collective (Studies 3, 6, and 7); experiencing independence versus interdependence (Study 4); and directing attention to objects versus the context (Studies 5a-b). Finally, we took a meta-analytic approach, showing that the effects found in Studies 3-6 are robust across priming tasks, problems, and samples. Taken together, the differences between cultural groups (Studies 1-2) were recreated when the individualistic/collectivistic cultural mindset was primed. (PsycINFO Database Record"

We move beyond the question of actual performance to study its assessment by evaluators. We hypothesized that even in the absence of performance differences, assessment’s function of selection (i.e., compare, rank, and track students) leads evaluators to create a SES achievement gap. In 2 experiments (N = 196; N = 259), participants had to assess a test supposedly produced by a high- or a low-SES student, and used assessment for selection (i.e., normative grading) or learning (i.e., formative comments). Results showed that evaluators using assessment for selection found more mistakes if the test was attributed to a low-rather than a high-SES student, a difference reduced in the assessment for learning condition. The third and fourth experiments (N = 374; N = 306) directly manipulated the function of assessment to investigate whether the production of the social class achievement gap was facilitated by the function of selection to a greater extent than the educational function. Results of Experiment 3 supported this hypothesis. The effect did not reach significance for Experiment 4, but an internal meta-analysis confirmed that assessment used for selection led evaluators to create a SES achievement gap more than assessment used for learning, thereby contributing to the reproduction of social inequalities.

In the present paper we begin to characterize the underlying process of face-context integration. Specifically, we examine whether it is a relatively controlled or automatic process. In Experiment 1 participants were motivated and instructed to avoid using the context while categorizing contextualized facial expression, or they were led to believe that the context was irrelevant. Nevertheless, they were unable to disregard the context, which exerted a strong effect on their emotion recognition. In Experiment 2, participants categorized contextualized facial expressions while engaged in a concurrent working memory task. Despite the load, the context exerted a strong influence on their recognition of facial expressions. These results suggest that facial expressions and their body contexts are integrated in an unintentional, uncontrollable, and relatively effortless manner."

Yet, the fact that viewers fail to distinguish these expressions does not in itself testify that the faces are physically identical. In Experiment 1, the muscular activity of victorious and defeated faces was analyzed. Higher numbers of individually coded facial actions—particularly smiling and mouth opening—were more common among winners than losers, indicating an objective difference in facial activity. In Experiment 2, we asked whether supplying participants with valid or invalid information about objective facial activity and valence would alter their ratings. Notwithstanding these manipulations, valence ratings were virtually identical in all groups, and participants failed to differentiate between positive and negative faces. While objective differences between intense positive and negative faces are detectable, human viewers do not utilize these differences in determining valence.

Specifically, it is unknown whether the face and body are perceived as distinct components or as an integrated, gestalt-like unit. To examine this question, we investigated whether emotional face–body composites are processed in a holistic-like manner by using a variant of the composite face task, a measure of holistic processing. Participants judged facial expressions combined with emotionally congruent or incongruent bodies that have been shown to influence the recognition of emotion from the face. Critically, the faces were either aligned with the body in a natural position or misaligned in a manner that breaks the ecological person form. Converging data from 3 experiments confirm that breaking the person form reduces the facilitating influence of congruent body context as well as the impeding influence of incongruent body context on the recognition of emotion from the face. These results show that faces and bodies are processed as a single unit and support the notion of a composite person effect analogous to the classic effect described for faces."

Three studies examined these issues demonstrating that the more participants spontaneously selfdistanced while reflecting on negative memories, the less emotional (Studies 1–3) and cardiovascular (Study 2) reactivity they displayed in the short term. Spontaneous self-distancing was also associated with lower emotional reactivity and intrusive ideation over time (Study 1). The negative association between spontaneous self-distancing and emotional reactivity was mediated by how participants construed their experience (i.e., less recounting relative to reconstruing) rather than avoidance (Studies 1–2). In addition, spontaneous self-distancing was associated with more problem-solving behavior and less reciprocation of negativity during conflicts among couples in ongoing relationships (Study 3).

Home environment and living habits are also associated with literacy (reading culture) and, in particular, parental levels of education directly affect the development of child literacy. Reading efficiency relating to reading comprehension and reading to learn is an important element of reading literacy performance. The findings of several authors indicate empirical evidence of the existence of deficits and poor reading comprehension in pupils living in poverty and stress the importance of offsetting deficits and developing reading comprehension.
The results of study, in which we investigated and identified the latent structure of the problems in the area of reading comprehension, show that problems in reading comprehension indicate other skills and processes such those necessary for good reading comprehension. The results of factor analysis showed differences in the latent structure of problems in reading comprehension and the latent structure of good reading comprehension. These require differing treatment of pupils who have problems with reading comprehension, with a greater emphasis on the development of phonological awareness, vocabulary development, language skills and automatisation of reading as a prerequisite for achieving good reading comprehension. As parents of pupils who have problems with reading comprehension cannot be sufficiently effective in encouraging and supporting the development of cognitive factors relevant to reading, it is even more important that professional workers in schools provide appropriate treatment for pupils with deficits in this area."

In this article the authors review studies of word learning by normal adults and children, neuropsychological patients, and special developmental populations, which provide evidence that the phonological loop plays a crucial role in learning the novel phonological forms of new words.

These models share the assumption that the representations computed by the HPM accurately reflect the linguistic input. This assumption has been challenged by Ferreira (2003), who showed that comprehenders sometimes misinterpret unambiguous sentences in which subject and object appear in noncanonical order, such as passives or object-clefts. According to Ferreira, these misinterpretations show that parallel to an algorithmic analysis, the HPM performs a heuristic analysis sometimes resulting in interpretations not licensed by the grammar. Our study investigated whether misinterpretation effects indeed reflect an erroneous mapping of form to meaning due to heuristic processing strategies. Using an experimental design closely following Ferreira (2003), Experiment 1 demonstrates that errors with noncanonical sentences show up in German as well, despite the fact that German provides morphological case, which a heuristic strategy should use. Experiment 2 required participants to judge the plausibility of the same sentences. With this task, no evidence for misinterpretation of noncanonical sentences was found. Taken together, our results suggest that misinterpretation errors do not reflect errors in the mapping of form to meaning, but task-specific difficulties that arise when participants retrieve information from the memory representation of a sentence. Consequently, misinterpretation errors do not provide evidence for the claim that the HPM pursues a heuristic analysis in addition to an algorithmic analysis. Our results instead lend support to models of the HPM that assume algorithmic processing only. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The 86 subjects were initially aged six to eight years and most were followed up after two years. When variance due to IQ and age was accounted for, an orthographic processing task, phonological awareness (phoneme deletion), and digit- naming speed were significant predictors of later reading skills. A strength in phonological awareness differentiated initial poor readers who later made excellent gains in reading from poor readers who did not improve. Children whose reading deteriorated had serious weaknesses on tasks of naming speed and confrontation naming. Their poor lexical retrieval skills had a more deleterious effect on later reading than on initial. Indications were that for children diagnosed as poor readers at age six or seven years, prognosis is better for boys, and for garden- variety poor readers, than for dyslexics. Caution was urged in applying the term dyslexic to children in the first two school grades because many of them will be slow starters who do not have a persistent reading problem."

The strongest differentiators of adequate and poor readers, with IQ and reading experience controlled, were phonemic awareness, naming speed for letters and pictured objects, and visual symbol processing. Letter naming speed made the largest independent contribution to word recognition, phonemic awareness to pseudoword reading, and object naming speed to reading comprehension. Confrontation picture naming accounted for minimal variance in reading skills, when IQ was controlled.

In addition, by adding an orthographic factor, we extended it to a triple deficit hypothesis. Participants were 90 children aged 6 to 10 years. Dyslexic children, whose reading was low for age and for expected level, garden-variety poor readers, reading-level matched younger children, and low verbal IQ good readers, were compared. The dyslexic group was significantly lower then the garden-variety poor readers and the low verbal IQ good readers on most measures, and lower than the younger group on phonological measures. Findings support the double deficit hypothesis of Bowers and Wolf, and also the triple deficit hypothesis. Most of the poorest readers, nearly all of whom qualified as dyslexic, had a double or triple deficit in phonological, naming-speed, and orthographic skills. Conclusions were that dyslexia results from an overload of deficits in skills related to reading, for which the child cannot easily compensate."

Within-dyad similarity was statistically significant on 86% of variables measured. To determine whether similarity was primarily attributable to niche construction (i.e., selection) or social influence, we tested whether similarity increased as closeness, intimacy, discussion, length of relationship, and importance of the attitude increased. There were no effects on similarity of closeness, relationship length, or discussion of the attitude. There were quite modest effects of intimacy, and a reliable effect of the shared importance of the attitude. Because relationship length, intimacy, closeness, and discussion can all serve as markers of opportunity for, or potency of social influence, these data are consistent with the “niche construction” account of similarity. In 2 follow-up controlled longitudinal field studies, participants interacted with people they did not know from their large lecture classes, and at a later time completed a survey of attitudes, values, and personality traits. Interacting pairs were not more similar than chance, but for the 23% of dyads that interacted beyond the first meeting, there was significant similarity within dyad members. These 2 lines of inquiry converge to suggest that similarity is mainly due to niche construction, and is most important in the early stages of a relationship; its importance to further relationship development wanes.

One popular explanation for fadeout of early mathematics interventions is that elementary school teachers may not teach the kind of advanced content that children are prepared for after receiving the intervention, so lower-achieving children in the control groups of early mathematics interventions catch up to the higher-achieving children in the treatment groups. An alternative explanation is that persistent individual differences in children's long-term mathematical development result more from relatively stable preexisting differences in their skills and environments than from the direct effects of previous knowledge on later knowledge. We tested these 2 hypotheses using data from an effective preschool mathematics intervention previously known to show a diminishing treatment effect over time. We compared the intervention group to a matched subset of the control group with a similar mean and variance of scores at the end of treatment. We then tested the relative contributions of factors that similarly constrain learning in children from treatment and control groups with the same level of posttreatment achievement and preexisting differences between these 2 groups to the fadeout of the treatment effect over time.

Individual differences in the reported use of effective strategies accounted for substantial variance in span performance. In contrast to the strategy-deficit hypothesis, however, young and older adults reported using the same proportion of normatively effective strategies on both span tasks.

Activity in narrative text is dynamic, so readers must frequently update their situation models when dimensions of the situation change. Updating can be incremental, such that a change leads to updating just the dimension that changed, or global, such that the entire model is updated. Here, we asked whether older and young adults make differential use of incremental and global updating. Participants read narratives containing changes in characters and spatial location and responded to recognition probes throughout the texts. Responses were slower when probes followed a change, suggesting that situation models were updated at changes. When either dimension changed, responses to probes for both dimensions were slowed; this provides evidence for global updating. Moreover, older adults showed stronger evidence of global updating than did young adults. One possibility is that older adults perform more global updating to offset reduced ability to manipulate information in working memory."

While identifying, naming, or categorizing pictures, event-related potentials (ERP) were registered. Three cognition-related components were found: the N460, the P780, and the Slow Wave (SW). LAP-children produced weak N460 activity across tasks, whereas LAL children, and to a lesser degree, non-risk children produced robust task-dependent activity. This finding may indicate that LAP-children lack semantic input while processing the figures. P780 latencies to frequently occurring figures were found hemisphere-dependent: LAP-children showed longer latencies in the right than in the left hemisphere, whereas the distribution was reversed in the LAL and non-risk children. It was also found that the right hemisphere is generally responsible for a lion’s share of the processing of figures and therefore it seems that the right hemisphere of LAP-children invests ample time in doing so. Whereas LAP-children showed largest SW amplitude differences between frequent and infrequent stimuli at posterior locations, LAL children did so at frontal locations. Assuming that the SW represents working-memory processes, it may be that working-memory in LAP-children deals with figure-relevant visual–spatial information and with figure-derived concepts in LAL children. Overall, the findings suggest that LAL and LAP represent two different groups of kindergartners at risk of dyslexia and that these differences, to some degree, fit with the presumed etiology of L- and P-type dyslexia."

As accumulated data suggests that these two modes of reading only partially overlap, our understanding of the natural mode of reading may still be limited. The present study was set out to explore the underlying skills of reading acquisition examined using silent measures of reading. To this end, children acquiring reading of the phonologically transparent vowelized Hebrew orthography were followed from kindergarten to the 2nd grade. The relations between a range of verbal and visual-spatial skills with measures of silent reading were tested. Phonological awareness, RAN and vocabulary explained a significant amount of variance in fluency in word recognition and in fluency in decoding of pseudo-homophones, while visual speed of processing of numeric symbols explained a notable amount of variance in fluency in word recognition only. Phonological awareness, morphological awareness and phonological working memory were the main skills explaining the variance in reading comprehension. The relations of these skills with the quality of oral reading have been widely established in the reading literature. Furthermore, a similar developmental picture was obtained in the relations between some of these skills and silent reading, as was found with oral reading. Therefore the role of these skills in reading may not be restricted to a certain mode of reading. Also consistent with findings on oral reading, the role of the visual non-orthographic skills in the measures of silent reading was insignificant to very small. Together these results imply that the processes underlying measures of silent reading are not substantially different from the ones underlying measures of oral reading, at least not at the early stages of reading acquisition of a transparent orthography."

This study set out to examine whether these groups can be found in adults, readers and spellers of Hebrew, which differs from the previously studied orthographies in many aspects. To this end, Hebrew-speaking adults with or without reading disability were administered various literacy and literacy-related tests. Results confirm the existence of the same three groups. While all shared a phonological deficit, subtle differences in phonological decoding ability and in speed of processing distinguished between the groups.

Manipulations applied on the presentation of texts, leading to “on-line” effects on reading (i.e., while texts are manipulated), are one direction of examinations in search of methods affecting reading. The imposing of time constraints, by deleting one letter after the other from texts presented on a computer screen, has been established as such a method. In an attempt to further understand its nature, we tested the relations between time constraints and processes of reading: phonological decoding of small orthogrpahic units and the addressing of orthographic representations from the mental lexicon. We also examined whether the type of orthogrpahic unit deleted (lexical, sublexical, or nonlexical unit) has any additional effect. Participants were German fifth graders with ( n  = 29) or without ( n  = 34) reading disability. Time constraints enhanced fluency in reading in both groups, and to a similar extent, across conditions. Comprehension was unimpaired. These results place the very principle of time constraints, regardless of the orthographic unit manipulated, as a critical factor affecting fluency in reading. However, phonological decoding explained a significant amount of variance in fluency in reading across all conditions in reading-disabled children, whereas the addressing of orthographic representations was the consistent predictor of fluency in reading in regular readers. These results indicate a qualitative difference in the processes explaining the variance in fluency in reading in regular and reading-disabled readers and suggest that time constraints might not have an effect on the relations between these processes and reading performance."

These theories argue that even in the absence of material and reputational benefits, individuals reap utility from the feelings associated with doing good. In response to this normative view of altruism, this article examines the descriptive question of whether laypeople penalize emotional prosocial actors. Six studies find that emotion serves as a positive signal of moral character, despite the intrapsychic benefits associated with it. This is true when emotion motivates prosocial behavior (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 5) and when emotion is a positive outcome of prosocial behavior (i.e., �warm glow�; Studies 4, 5, and 6). Emotional actors are considered to be moral because people believe emotion provides an honest and direct signal that the actor feels a genuine concern for others. Consequently, prosocial actors who are motivated by the expectation of emotional rewards are judged differently than prosocial actors who are motivated by other benefits, such as reputational or material rewards (Study 6). These results suggest that laypeople do not view altruism as incompatible with all benefits to the self. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)"

J. hanger (1978) remains true today: that much of contemporary psychological research is based on the assumption that people are consciously and systematically processing incoming information in order to construe and interpret their world and to plan and engage in courses of action. As did E. J. hanger, the authors question this assumption. First, they review evidence that the ability to exercise such conscious, intentional control is actually quite limited, so that most of moment-to-mom ent psychological life must occur through nonconscious means if it is to occur at all. The authors then describe the different possible mechanisms that produce automatic, environmental control over these various phenomena and review evidence establishing both the existence of these mechanisms as well as their consequences for judgments, emotions, and behavior. Three major forms of automatic self-regulation are identified: an automatic effect of perception on action, automatic goal pursuit, and a continual automatic evaluation of one's experience. From the accumulating evidence, the authors conclude that these various nonconscious mental systems perform the lion's share of the self-regulatory burden, beneficently keeping the individual grounded in his or her current environment. The strongest knowledge—that of the total unfreedom of the human will—is nonetheless the poorest in successes, for it always has the strongest opponent: human vanity. —Nietzsche, Human, All Too Human"

Here the authors consider the common philosophical commitment to determinism by both schools, and how the radical behaviorists' thesis of the determined nature of higher mental processes is being pursued today in social cognition research on automaticity. In harmony with ""dual process"" models in contemporary cognitive science, which equate determined processes with those that are automatic and which require no intervening conscious choice or guidance, as opposed to ""controlled"" processes which do, the social cognition research on the automaticity of higher mental processes provides compelling evidence for the determinism of those processes. This research has revealed that social interaction, evaluation and judgment, and the operation of internal goal structures can all proceed without the intervention of conscious acts of will and guidance of the process. The products of the crude, wholistic, and parallel ""primary processes"" are usually elaborated by the ""secondary processes,"" which include deliberate manipulation of information by an active agent. An analogy to the ""executive routines"" of computer programs shows that an agent need not be a homunculus. However, it is clear that motivation enters at several points in these processes to determine their outcome. Thus, an integration of cognitive and dynamic psychology is necessary to the understanding of higher mental processes. (Ulric Neisser, 1967, p."

memorial or other knowledge states, is vital for many strands of psychology, including
determining the accuracy of feelings of knowing, and discriminating conscious from
unconscious cognition. Quantifying metacognitive sensitivity is however more challenging
than quantifying basic stimulus sensitivity. Under popular signal detection theory (SDT)
models for stimulus classification tasks, approaches based on type II receiver-operator
characteristic (ROC) curves or type II d-prime risk confounding metacognition with
response biases in either the type I (classification) or type II (metacognitive) tasks. A new
approach introduces meta-d′: the type I d-prime that would have led to the observed type
II data had the subject used all the type I information. Here we (i) further establish the
inconsistency of the type II d-prime and ROC approaches with new explicit analyses of
the standard SDT model, and (ii) analyse, for the first time, the behaviour of meta-d′
under non-trivial scenarios, such as when metacognitive judgments utilize enhanced or
degraded versions of the type I evidence. Analytically, meta-d′ values typically reflect the
underlying model well, and are stable under changes in decision criteria; however, in
relatively extreme cases meta-d′ can become unstable. We explore bias and variance of
in-sample measurements of meta-d′ and supply MATLAB code for estimation in general

The model assumes that both components (i.e., processing and maintenance) of the main working memory tasks require attention and that memory traces decay as soon as attention is switched away. Because memory retrievals are constrained by a central bottleneck and thus totally capture attention, it was predicted that the maintenance of the items to be recalled depends on both the number of memory retrievals required by the intervening treatment and the time allowed to perform them. This number of retrievals:time ratio determines the cognitive load of the processing component. The authors show in 7 experiments that working memory spans vary as a function of this cognitive load. Ever since the seminal studies by Baddeley and Hitch (1974), working memory has generally been viewed as a system devoted to the coordination of processing and storage. The authors observed that when adults were asked to perform a reasoning task, their performances were impaired by a concurrent memory load and that this impairment was all the more pronounced the more difficult the reasoning task was. Thus, Baddeley and Hitch (1974) suggested that both processing and storage involve a common cognitive system that they thought of as a central executive. The limited capacity of this central executive is thought to be responsible for the phenomenon known as the processing-storage tradeoff. Under heavy memory load, resources that are devoted to storage are no longer available for processing and performance"

This model, called ADAPT, is developmental, asemantic, and procedural. The authors’ main proposal is that the transcoding process shifts from an algorithmic strategy to the direct retrieval from memory of digital forms. Thus, the model is evolutive, adaptive, and particularly suited to account for learning and development. ADAPT, which has been implemented in a computer program, accounts for existing and new developmental data, for new data in adolescents with mild retardation, and for the neuropsychological cases described in the literature. How do people write numbers? Classical models assume that transcoding numbers from their verbal to their digital forms involves the construction of a semantic representation of the quantity to which the different parts of the numeral refer along with a representation of their mathematical relations (McCloskey, Caramazza, & Basili, 1985; Power & Dal Martello, 1990; Power & Longuet-Higgins, 1978). Then, through the understanding of these product and sum relations, numerals could be transcoded in their digital form. Thus, the classical view of transcoding supposes that children have an understanding of numbers, even large numbers, that precedes and underpins transcoding. But, where does this complete understanding come from in young children? Actually, in their seminal article, Power and Longuet-Higgins (1978) acknowledged that their model was not intended as a model of how children learn to count. By contrast, we assume that transcoding numbers does not necessitate such a complex understanding. This article presents an asemantic procedural transcoding system that accounts for the way children learn to transcode numerals without accessing their meaning and for the evolution of transcoding processes through practice. We call this model ADAPT, with D, A, and P standing for developmental, asemantic, and procedural, respectively."

Hitch's (1974) multiple-component model is contradicted by facts, leaving unresolved one of the main issues of cognitive functioning. In this article, the author derive from the time-based resource-sharing model of working memory a mathematical function relating the cognitive load involved by concurrent processing to the amount of information that can be simultaneously maintained active in working memory. A meta-analysis from several experiments testing the effects of processing on storage corroborates the parameters of the predicted function, suggesting that it properly reflects the law relating the 2 functions of working memory."

Keywords: Self-management, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Behavioral Intervention. ********** Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurobehavioral disorder diagnosed in children today with nearly 3.8 million diagnosed in the United States (Frazier & Merrell, 1997; Root & Resnick, 2003; ""Treat ADHD,"" 2002). Given the prevalence of ADHD, considerable research has explored treatment options for this population. Literature reviews and meta-analyses of treatment options including medical management, psychosocial interventions, and educational treatments are available in their respective fields (see Conners; 2002; DuPaul & Eckert, 1997; Purdie, Hattie, & Carroll, 2002). This literature review briefly summarizes a theoretical model of ADHD and empirically supported best practices in treatment of ADHD as a means of establishing the context for a review of literature on self-management. The literature on self-management applied specifically to ADHD is limited in scope and contains discrepant findings. Variations in treatment methods and effects are considered. Future research directions and implications for professionals in the field of behavior analysis are discussed. Theoretical Model of ADHD and Support for Self-Management Teaching appropriate behavioral skills is a common intervention when an appropriate replacement behavior is warranted or a skill deficit is observed. Prior to teaching skills, it is always important to discriminate between actual behavioral deficits and behavioral performance. Barkley (2000) noted much of the research in the area of psychosocial and educational treatments for ADHD has been conducted based on the assumption that individuals with ADHD have skill deficits due to a lack of learning. He further postulated that these efforts have been misguided because a lack of learning is not the problem for this population. When considering treatment options, it is important to understand the nature of the disorder and the observed behavioral deficits. Barkley's (1997) theoretical model provides a useful context in which to evaluate possible treatment interventions and observed outcomes. Barkley (1997) proposed a theory of behavioral inhibition, sustained attention, and executive function in which he ascribed the fundamental problem of ADHD to a deficit in inhibitory control caused by a neurological difference in the prefrontal cortex. This lack of inhibitory control in individuals with ADHD impairs the executive functions that control organization and planning identified as nonverbal working memory, internalization of speech, self-regulation of affect/motivation/arousal, and behavioral analysis and synthesis. These impaired executive functions directly affect an individual's ability to self-manage behavior by limiting their capacity to a) consider their own behavior in the context of past events or possible future consequences, b) internalize self-directing statements [which is the crux of cognitive-behavioral self-management, Michenbaum, (1977)], c) self-regulate emotional reactions, motivation or effort towards a goal, and arousal, and d) coordinate evaluation of behavior through analysis of events or synthesis of ideas. Empirical research supports this theoretical model and specifically the assumption that children with ADHD present a deficit in self-regulation (Douglas 1989; Miranda, Presentacion, & Soriano 2002; Pennington & Ozonoff, 1996; Sergeant & van der Meere, 1990; Tannock, 1998). …"

More particularly, we study the effectiveness of a web-based intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that a school offers to its students as optional homework, in a sample of 355 first-year secondary students, using an experimental design. The results show that whether students make this noncompulsory homework in the web-based ITS is dependent on their prior achievement and their teacher, and if they practice, they tend to choose easier modules. Students thus do not seem to optimize learning gains, but rather balance their perceived value of practicing and their ""expectancy,"" as found previously for regular (compulsory, non-ITS) homework. Regarding the value of choice, findings suggest that students may be poor judges of their most beneficial exercises pattern. Differentiation in ITS does not guarantee learning, unless scaffolding is tightly linked to it. In line with previous research, this research shows that practice does matter, though at varying intensities. Yet it also clarifies that motivation to make an effort is required, which adds to the lessons learned from homework research; both the perceived value and expectancy are at play and can be enhanced, for example, by teachers."

There is agreement that some nonhuman animals “succeed” in these metacognitive tasks, but little consensus about the cognitive mechanisms underlying performance. In one paradigm, rhesus monkeys visually searched for hidden food when ignorant of the location of the food, but acted immediately when knowledgeable. This result has been interpreted as evidence that monkeys introspectively monitored their memory to adaptively control information seeking. However, convincing alternative hypotheses have been advanced that might also account for the adaptive pattern of visual searching. We evaluated seven hypotheses using a computerized task in which monkeys chose either to take memory tests immediately or to see the answer again before proceeding to the test. We found no evidence to support the hypotheses of behavioral cue association, rote response learning, expectancy violation, response competition, generalized search strategy, or postural mediation. In contrast, we repeatedly found evidence to support the memory monitoring hypothesis. Monkeys chose to see the answer when memory was poor, either from natural variation or experimental manipulation. We found limited evidence that monkeys also monitored the fluency of memory access.

Research using a 2-factor or 4-facet model of psychopathy highlights some dimension-specific differences in EF, but this research is limited in scope. Another complicating factor in teasing apart the EF–psychopathy relationship is the tendency to use different psychopathy assessments for incarcerated versus community samples. In this study, an EF battery and multiple measures of psychopathic dimensions were administered to a sample of male prisoners (N 377). Results indicate that using the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), the independent effect of Factor 2 was related to worse EF, but neither the independent effect of Factor 1 nor the unique variance of the Factors (1 or 2) were related to EF.

One theoretical perspective suggests that, psychopathy is associated with an early attention bottleneck that precludes the processing of contextual information, leading to a rigid goal-directed focus. Alternatively, externalizing may be associated with an over-allocation of processing resources to motivationally-salient information, which disrupts the use of cognitive control. In this study, male prisoners assessed on psychopathic and externalizing traits performed a new gaze detection task involving affective faces. As predicted, psychopathy but not externalizing was associated with superior performance on the gaze-detection task when the necessity of using contextual affect to regulate goal-directed behavior was minimized. Conversely, externalizing but not psychopathy was associated with increased errors on trials that required participants to use affective expressions, specifically fear, as a cue to inhibit dominant responses. These results have theoretical and applied significance for both psychopathic and externalizing forms of disinhibition. Recognition and utilization of facial affect are important for socialization and interpersonal interactions, therefore, any cognitive-affective processes that interrupt the fluency with which this information is processed may be important for understanding the underpinnings of disinhibition."

The empathy-specific reward hypothesis proposes that the prosocial motivation associated with empathy is directed toward the goal of obtaining social or self-rewards (i.e., praise, honor, and pride). The empathy-specific punishment hypothesis proposes that this motivation is directed toward the goal of avoiding social or self-punishments (i.e., censure, guilt, and shame). Study 1 provided an initial test of the empathy-specific reward hypothesis. Studies 2 through 4 used three procedures to test the empathy-specific punishment hypothesis. In Study 5, a Stroop procedure was used to assess the role of reward-relevant, punishment-relevant, and victim-relevant cognitions in mediating the empathy-helping relationship. Results of these five studies did not support either the empathy-specific reward or the empathy-specific punishment hypothesis. Instead, results of each supported the empathy-altruism hypothesis. Evidence that empathic emotion evokes altruistic motivation continues to mount."

Two studies examined the relative roles of language proficiency and metamemory in predicting rehearsal use, as well as the prediction of metamemory performance by language proficiency. In Study 1, 59 children, 5 to 8 years old, were administered a serial recall task, 2 language measures, a nonverbal cognitive measure, and a rapid automatized naming (RAN) task. Language proficiency, RAN, and age were significant individual predictors of rehearsal use. In hierarchical regression analyses, language proficiency mediated almost completely the age [arrow right] rehearsal use relation. In addition, automatized naming was a strong but partial mediator of the contribution of language proficiency to rehearsal use. In Study 2, 54 children were administered a metamemory test, a language measure, and a serial recall task. Metamemory skills and, again, language proficiency significantly predicted rehearsal use in the task. The predictive strength of metamemory skills was mediated by the children's language proficiency. The mutually supportive roles of automatized naming, language, and metamemory in the emergence of spontaneous cumulative verbal rehearsal are discussed in the context of the resulting model, along with the minimal roles of age and aspects of intelligence.Keywords: memory, rehearsal, metamemory, language, strategyThe development and use of children's memory strategies and their effects on recall have been well documented. One of the more extensively researched strategies has been spontaneous cumulative verbal rehearsal in serial recall tasks (e.g., Bebko, 1979; Cowan et al., 1998; Flavell, 1970; Gathercole & Pickering, 1999; Kail, 1990). Still not clearly understood, however, are those potential underlying skills that are both necessary and sufficient to enable rehearsal to emerge (Baker-Ward, Omstein, & Holden, 1984; Miller & Seier, 1994; Whitebread, 1999; Winsler & Naglieri, 2003). The identification of such underlying skills would prove useful in explaining individual differences, both between same-aged peers, some of whom spontaneously use rehearsal strategies and others do not, as well as between younger and older children.One of the potential underlying variables that has previously been investigated is the development of metacognitive skills (DeMarie & Ferron, 2003; DeMarie, Miller, Ferron, & Cunningham, 2004; Flavell, 1970; Flavell & Wellman, 1977; Henry & Norman, 19%; Kron-Sperl & Schneider, 2008; Lockl & Schneider, 2006). In addition, developing language skills have been implicated as a critical variable (Bebko, 1984; Bebko & McKinnon, 1990; Burkholder & Pisoni, 2003; Ellis, Woodley-Zanthos, Dulaney, & Palmer, 1989). Drawing together these two separate lines of research, the present studies explored the connection between metacognition and language proficiency in the emergence of spontaneous rehearsal.Research over the past five decades corroborates that the majority of children around 7 to 8 years of age spontaneously use verbal rehearsal strategies when sequentially ordered information is to be remembered (e.g., Bebko, 1984; Bebko & McKinnon, 1990; Bjorklund, Coyle, & Gaultney, 1992; Cowan, Saults, Nugent, & Elliott, 1999; Flavell, 1970; Flavell, Beach, & Chinsky, 1966), and, as a result, their recall performance is enhanced over younger (5- and 6-year-olds) and same-aged children who do not use rehearsal, although there is additional development in the efficiency of those strategies (e.g., Miller & Seier, 1994). Because older children use the strategy and younger children (e.g., 5- and 6-year-olds) typically do not, age is frequently inferred as a relevant variable; however, individual variations among same-aged peers are often of a magnitude similar to between-ages differences (Lacasse & Bebko, 1989), and for exceptional populations (e. …"

Method: Ninety-eight participants diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were reevaluated approximately 10 years later. Eighty-five never-ADHD controls similar in age, IQ, sociodemographic background, and gender distribution served as a comparison group. Participants were administered a psychiatric interview and the Stimulus and Response Conflict Tasks (Nassauer & Halperin, 2003). Results: Participants with childhood ADHD demonstrated slower and less accurate responses to both control and conflict conditions relative to the comparison group, as well as more variable responses in both conditions of the motor inhibition task; there was no specific effect of childhood ADHD on perceptual or motor inhibition. ADHD persisters and partial remitters did not differ in overall accuracy, speed or variability in responding, but relative to partial remitters, persisters demonstrated greater slowing in response to perceptual conflict. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with theories positing state regulation, but not inhibitory control deficits in the etiology of ADHD, and suggest that improved perceptual inhibition may be associated with better outcome for ADHD.

The present meta-analyses focus on one specific game genre that has been of particular interest to the scientific community—action video games, and cover the period 2000–2015. To assess the long-lasting impact of action video game play on various domains of cognition, we first consider cross-sectional studies that inform us about the cognitive profile of habitual action video game players, and document a positive average effect of about half a standard deviation (g = 0.55). We then turn to long-term intervention studies that inform us about the possibility of causally inducing changes in cognition via playing action video games, and show a smaller average effect of a third of a standard deviation (g = 0.34). Because only intervention studies using other commercially available video game genres as controls were included, this latter result highlights the fact that not all games equally impact cognition. Moderator analyses indicated that action video game play robustly enhances the domains of top-down attention and spatial cognition, with encouraging signs for perception. Publication bias remains, however, a threat with average effects in the published literature estimated to be 30% larger than in the full literature. As a result, we encourage the field to conduct larger cohort studies and more intervention studies, especially those with more than 30 hours of training. Public Significance Statement : Understanding the effects of action video game play is essential given that (a) a large number of individuals regularly spend many hours on these types of games, and (b) proponents are offering suites of video games that are claimed to change behavior or enhance cognition. The 2 meta-analyses in this paper present the current status of this field, concluding that playing action video games has some positive effects on improving cognitive skills. This review also identifies some limitations of current research."

Video microanalysis taught me to see how the intricate process of mother-infant momentto-moment communication works. It is a powerful research, treatment, and training tool. I owe my love of video microanalysis to Dan Stern. Video or film microanalysis operates like a social microscope into the underworld just below perceptible view in real time. Mother-infant communicative events occur in less than a second (Beebe, 1982). They are so rapid and subtle that they are not quite grasped in real time. By slowing down the movements, frame-by-frame microanalysis identifies remarkably beautiful moments, such as both partners rising up and up into glorious sunbursts of smiles. It also reveals very disturbing moments, such as maternal anger or disgust faces, or infants becoming frantically distressed or frozen in alarm. By videotaping mothers and infants split-screen, one camera on each partner, we can see the momentby-moment dialogue between the two. From birth, infants live in a two-person social world, and they are capable of coordinating their behaviors with those of the partner (Peery, 1980; Trevarthen, 1979)."

Structural equation modeling (SEM) was then used to describe the relationships between expectancies and differences in (a) cognitive ability and concept formation, (b) risk-taking personality traits, and (c) social exposure or values regarding alcohol-related information.

We contend that the mental representations of everyday objects and situations include their speed, and that the latter influences behavior in instantaneous and systematic ways. An important corollary is that high-speed objects are named faster than low-speed objects, although object speed is irrelevant to the naming task at hand. The results of a series of 7 studies with pictures and words support these predictions. Everyday objects evoke mental constructs and dispositions be- yond mere perception or recognition. These constructs are acti- vated in a fast and automatic fashion, often outside of conscious awareness (Bargh, 1994; Higgins, 1996; Hassin, 2013). Arguably the best-known and most-researched property of objects is their valence. Valence is present not only with obviously threatening or appealing stimuli such as a snake or a piece of food, but a modicum of valence or ""microvalence"" (Lebrecht, Bar, Barret, & Tarr, 2012) is present in such an innocuous object as your morning coffee mug. The prevalence of valence is easily understood con- sidering its role in evolution and its role in shaping online moti- vations, emotions, and decisions. In the present study, we turn the spotlight to another high-level property—speed—which has largely been overlooked in the ex- isting literature. We argue that the mental representations of ev- eryday objects often include a value of speed, which can influence people's actions in a systematic fashion. In a series of seven studies, we show that object speed influences performance in such simple and instantaneous tasks as naming a picture of these objects or reading aloud their names. This influence is all the more impressive when one recognizes that object speed is irrelevant to the explicit task set at hand. Speed is a continuous variable.

Limitations, implications, and areas of future research are discussed. ********** Research into characteristics of children and adolescents with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) that impact school performance continues to inform the field. For example, in recent years we have gained insights into the nature of the language and achievement deficits that tend to co-exist with the emotional and behavioral difficulties of the nearly 500,000 students with EBD served in U.S. public schools (U.S. Department of Education, 2001). However, there remain areas related to school performance for students with EBD that merit attention. One of these areas is cognitive processing speed, which is the time required to process academic information. Adequate processing speed enables learners to perform basic tasks such as word reading or math computation without conscious effort, thereby allowing the learner to focus more attention on the more complex tasks of comprehending text or solving math problems. Understanding the nature of the processing speed of students with EBD may have direct implications on the type and intensity of academic intervention recommended by school personnel. We begin with a discussion of the language skills and academic functioning of students with EBD. Across areas of language and academic functioning, students with EBD lag behind their peers without verified handicapping conditions. In the area of language functioning, for example, Nelson, Benner, and Cheney (2005) reported that 68% of a cross-sectional population of public school students with EBD experienced clinical language deficits. Specifically, the percentage of students who scored below the mean of the norm group on standardized measures of total language, receptive language, and expressive language, were 85%, 77%, and 89%, respectively. Moreover, Nelson et al. (2005) found that students with EBD who exhibited externalizing problem behaviors (i.e., aggression, delinquent, attention problems) were more likely to experience language deficits than students who evidenced internalizing problem behaviors. These findings from cross-sectional research corroborate earlier results from a systematic review of the literature (i.e., Benner, Nelson, & Epstein, 2002) indicating that as many as 9 out of 10 children with EBD served in public school settings may have language deficits. Taken together, research suggests that not only do EBD and language deficits co-occur at a relatively high rate, but that the externalizing problem behaviors of students with EBD appear to be related to language functioning. …"

How should these resources be designed to best support learning? Previous research has shown that number books typically include multiple concrete representations of number. However, a large body of mathematics education research has demonstrated that there may be costs, as well as benefits, to using both multiple representations and concrete representations when learning mathematical concepts. Here we used an artificial symbol learning paradigm to explore whether the use of abstract (arrays of dots) or multiple concrete (changing arrays of pictures) numerical representations resulted in better learning of novel numerical symbols by children. Across 3 experiments, we found that children who learned the meaning of novel symbols by pairing them with numerosities represented by arrays of dots performed better on a subsequent symbolic comparison task than those who paired them with multiple concrete representations, or a mixture of abstract and multiple concrete representations. This advantage was not due to abstract representations being inherently superior to concrete representations, but instead to the use of multiple concrete representations. We conclude that the very common practice of using multiple concrete representations in children’s number books may not be the most effective to support children’s early number learning.

Children received instruction in grapheme-articulation and symbol-note correspondence patterns and, in the reading task, were taught to connect printed letter clusters with underlying oral-motor activity. Posttest results revealed that all groups of children were successful in the music task and in transferring sublexical segments representing trained reading rules, but disabled and young, normal readers were less able to read complete real and nonsense words.

Although the transliterations were completely unfamiliar visual stimuli, and in some cases their phonologic structure violated the phonology of literary Arabic (the only form of Arabic which can be legally written), they were not easily rejected in the lexical decision task and more slowly accepted in a phonologically based lexical decision task. Naming transliterations of spoken words was delayed relative to naming literary words and also delayed relative to pseudowords. This pattern suggests that phonological computation aimed at retrieving the phonological structure of the word is mandatory for lexical decision as well as for naming. A very sizeable frequency effect in lexical decision as well as in naming which was three times as big for literary words than for the transliterations suggest that addressed phonology is an option for very familiar orthographic patterns. Moreover, the frequency effect on processing transliterations indicated that lexical phonology is involved with pre-lexical phonological computation even ifaddressed phonology is not possible. These data support a combination between a cascade type process, in which partial products of the graphemeto-phoneme translation activate phonologic unites in the lexicon, and an interactive model in which the activated lexical units feed-back shaping the pre-lexical phonological computation process."

Yet studies examining the process of gang desistance in general and that of core gang members in particular, are quite rare. The current study aims to identify factors associated with desistance of core gang members as well as describe the nature of the process that these ""formers"" have undergone. Thirty-nine core ex-gang members (80% males and 20% females) from the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles, with an average length of 11.6-years gang membership, were interviewed regarding their involvement in the gang and the desistance process. A systematic qualitative analysis based on grounded theory methodology was mainly utilized. We found that the decision to leave the gang is a result of a combination of push (e.g., personal and vicarious victimization, burnout of gang lifestyle, disillusionment by the gang) and pull (e.g., parenthood, family responsibilities, religious and cultural awakening) factors that evolved over time. Push factors were more dominant in this domain. We also found that while male core ex-gang members tended to leave the gang more frequently because of push factors, female ex-gang members were more inclined to desist due to pull factors. Our analysis also showed that core gang members shared a general pattern of the desistance process comprising of the following 5 stages: triggering, contemplation, exploration, exiting and maintenance. Based on these results, we outlined stage-specific recommendations for agents of societal change to help in facilitating the desistance of core gang members.

These models adapt network weights when the network output does not match the target outputs computed by some agent. The authors present a model of motor learning in which the child uses exploration to discover appropriate ways of responding. The model is consistent with what is known about how neural systems evaluate behavior. The authors model the development of reaching and investigate N. Bernstein’s (1967) hypotheses about early motor learning. Simulations show the course of learning as well as model the kinematics of reaching by a dynamical arm. Almost all developmental theories assume that a child’s interaction with the environment plays an important role in development. Often this interaction leads to long-term changes in behavior that can best be described as learning. Modern theories of learning characterize the process as exploratory, as involving the variation and selection of behavior or strategies, or as the discovery of affordances (Berthier, 1996; Freedland & Bertenthal, 1994; Gibson, 1988; Siegler, 2000; Sporns & Edelman, 1993; Thelen et al., 1993). In summarizing recent research, Siegler (2000) suggested that learning in children has four central characteristics. First and in contrast to Piagetian theory, Siegler suggested that learning is gradual, with children often using older, less advanced cognitive strategies at the same time they use newer, more powerful ways of thinking. Second, he suggested that children learn from both their successes as well as their failures. Third, he argued that an important mechanism for the development of new ways of solving problems is strategic but that behavioral variability also leads to the discovery and selection of new cognitive strategies. Finally, Siegler concluded that behavioral variability is not simply random exploration but is constrained by the child’s conceptual understanding. The most popular quantitative models of development are connectionist networks using the backpropagation learning algorithm (e.g., Munakata & McClelland, 2003; although see Munakata &"

A central claim by D. C. Plaut and J. R. Booth (2000, 2006) is that their parallel distributed processing model simulates additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in the context of lexical decision. If correct, this success would have important implications for computational accounts of reading processes. However, the results of further simulations with this model undermine this claim given that the joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency yield a nonmonotonic function (underadditivity, additivity, and overadditivity) depending on the size of the stimulus quality effect, whereas skilled readers yield additivity more broadly. The implications of these results both locally and more globally are discussed, and a number of other issues are noted.

What is learned is less clear, even though this has important theoretical and practical implications. A recent analysis indicates that stimuli can become associated with a stop signal or with a stop goal. Furthermore, expectancy may play an important role. Previous studies that have used stop or no-go signals to manipulate stimulus-stop learning cannot distinguish between stimulus-signal and stimulus-goal associations, and expectancy has not been measured properly. In the present study, participants performed a task that combined features of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task in which the stop-signal rule changed at the beginning of each block. The go and stop signals were superimposed over 40 task-irrelevant images. Our results show that participants can learn direct associations between images and the stop goal without mediation via the stop signal. Exposure to the image-stop associations influenced task performance during training, and expectancies measured following task completion or measured within the task. But, despite this, we found an effect of stimulus-stop learning on test performance only when the task increased the task-relevance of the images. This could indicate that the influence of stimulus-stop learning on go performance is strongly influenced by attention to both task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus features.

Children struggled to acquire meanings of adjectives without semantic or physical scaffolding (Experiment 1), but they were successful in acquiring extensive lexical knowledge when offered semantic scaffolding (Experiment 2).

We hypothesized that people use more negations in descriptions of stereotype-inconsistent behavior than in descriptions of stereotype-consistent behavior. In 3 studies, participants either judged the applicability of experimentally controlled person descriptions or spontaneously produced person descriptions themselves. Results provided support for this hypothesis. Moreover, a 4th study demonstrated that negations have communicative consequences. When a target person’s behavior was described with negations, message recipients inferred that this behavior was an exception to the rule and that it was more likely caused by situational circumstances than by dispositional factors.

At the same time, profit-driven enterprise has contributed immensely to human prosperity. Though scholars agree that profit can incentivize societally beneficial behaviors, people may neglect this possibility. In 7 studies, we show that people see business profit as necessarily in conflict with social good, a view we call anti-profit beliefs. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that U.S. participants hold anti-profit views of real U.S. firms and industries. Study 3 shows that hypothetical organizations are seen as doing more harm when they are labeled “for-profit” rather than “non-profit,” while Study 4 shows that increasing harm to society is viewed as a strategy for increasing a hypothetical firm’s long-run profitability. Studies 5–7 demonstrate that carefully prompting subjects to consider the long run incentives of profit can attenuate anti-profit beliefs, while prompting short run thinking does nothing relative to a control. Together, these results suggest that the default view of profits is zero-sum. While people readily grasp how profit can incentivize firms to engage in practices that harm others, they neglect how it can incentivize firms to engage in practices that benefit others. Accordingly, people’s stereotypes of profit-seeking firms are excessively negative. Even in one of the most market-oriented societies in history, people doubt the contributions of profit-seeking industry to societal progress.

We propose that moral judgments are based, in part, on the degree of effort exerted in performing the immoral or moral act. Because effort can serve as an index of goal importance, greater effort in performing immoral acts would lead to more negative judgments, whereas greater effort in performing moral acts would lead to more positive judgments. In support of these ideas, we found that perceived effort intensified judgments of both immoral (Studies 1-2) and moral (Studies 2-7) agents. The effect of effort on judgment was independent of the outcome (Study 3) and of perceptions of the outcome extremity (Study 6). Furthermore, the effect of effort on judgment was mediated by perceived goal importance (Studies 4-6), even when controlling for perceived intentions (Studies 5-6). Finally, we demonstrate that perceived effort can influence actual behavior, such as the assignment of monetary rewards (Study 7). We discuss the possible implications of effort as a causal motivational factor in moral judgment and social retribution. (PsycINFO Database Record(c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved). Language: en"
START,START,2080845194,building fluent performance measuring response rate and multiplying response opportunities,2010,carl binder,the behavior analyst today,1,3,21,"Other articles in this special issue describe state-of-the-art measurement and instructional methodologies that use the tools of precision teaching and specific strategies that have evolved in its application with particular learner populations. The present author has participated in this work from the early 1970's and can cite examples of successful instruction using these methods with learners that span the range from students suffering from severe developmental disabilities in now-defunct institutions to 21st century corporate training with senior sales executives and customer service personnel. Rather than focusing on one or more populations, or on the specific instructional strategies associated with them, the purpose of this article is two-fold: 1) to describe a framework originally articulated in the 1970's for the evolution of precision teaching and ""fluency-based instruction"" (Binder, 1978, 1993) that provides a larger context for understanding other contributions in this field, and 2) to illustrate the elements of that framework with examples of measurement and instructional strategies from a range of different populations. Particularly at this time, when many of our colleagues in behavior analysis have not made contact with the work that led to precision teaching, or with early publications that emerged from that work, it seems worthwhile to establish a broader understanding of what precision teaching and its derivatives have brought to our field, and why. A Framework for Evolving Instructional Technology In the late 1960's and early 1970's, precision teaching involved a small and vibrant community of dedicated Skinnerian behavior analysts, led by Ogden Lindsley, Eric Haughton, and a handful of their colleagues and students. Lindsley (1964,1972) was committed to bringing the power of Skinner's ""method of free operant conditioning"" into the field of education, and this commitment drove the research and development of the time. It was the most pristine translation among behavioral educators and applied behavior analysts of Skinner's methodology and discoveries into education because it preserved without compromise Skinner's sensitive measure of behavior (""response strength""), rate of response or behavior frequency As the impact of measuring response rates in instructional procedures with freely emitted behavior became clear (Lindsley, 1992), precision | teachers saw that discrete trial procedures coupled with percentage correct evaluation had the effect of leaving behind what Skinner (Evans, 1968) and others considered to be his most important contribution. With under the influence of Eric Haughton, who referred to ""performance blocks"" of various kinds that prevent acceleration of learned behavior, Binder (1978) framed the evolution of instructional methods in precision teaching as a process of removing ""ceilings"" that obstruct the acceleration of behavior toward useful levels of performance supported by natural contingencies. Four Kinds of Ceilings that Prevent Growth of Skill The four ceilings originally named during the 1970's offer a framework for understanding how using response rate measures in instructional settings led to development of a new technology of teaching. The ceilings are: 1. Measurement-defined ceilings 2. Procedure-imposed ceilings (also called Teacher-imposed ceilings) 3. Deficit-imposed ceilings 4. Handicap-defined ceilings As Binder and his colleagues working in B.H. Barrett's laboratory classroom (Barrett, 1977) removed each ceiling, the next ceiling appeared as a flat data line on standard celeration charts above which students' performance would not accelerate. As each ceiling appeared, the need for changes in materials, procedures and behavior pinpoints become clear. The remainder of this section describes each ceiling with examples from different populations to illustrate underlying principles that drove the evolution of more effective and efficient performance development strategies. …"

To empirically test this, 84 healthy older adults aged 64 to 75 years were randomly assigned to one of three single-domain training conditions (inhibition, visuomotor function, spatial navigation) or to the simultaneous training of all three cognitive functions (multi-domain training condition). All participants trained on an iPad at home for 50 training sessions. Before and after the training, and at a 6-month follow-up measurement, cognitive functioning and training transfer were assessed with a neuropsychological test battery including tests targeting the trained functions (near transfer) and transfer to executive functions (far transfer: attentional control, working memory, speed). Participants in all four training groups showed a linear increase in training performance over the 50 training sessions. Using a latent difference score model, the multi-domain training group, compared with the single-domain training groups, showed more improvement on the far transfer attentional control composite. Individuals with initially lower baseline performance showed higher training-related improvements, indicating that training compensated for lower initial cognitive performance. At the 6-month follow-up, performance on the cognitive test battery remained stable. This is one of the first studies to investigate systematically multi-domain training including comparable single-domain training conditions. Our findings suggest that multi-domain training enhances attentional control involved in handling several different tasks at the same time, an aspect in everyday life that is particularly challenging for older people.

The merging of these categories has been motivated by the reconceptualization of dyslexia as a language disorder in which phonological processing is deficient. The authors argue that this focus underestimates the independent influence of semantic and syntactic deficits, which are widespread in SLI and which affect reading comprehension and impair attainment of fluent reading in adolescence. The authors suggest that 2 dimensions of impairment are needed to conceptualize the relationship between these disorders and to capture phenotypic features that are important for identifying neurobiologically and etiologically coherent subgroups. Specific language impairment (SLI) and developmental dyslexia (also known as specific reading disability; SRD) are common developmental disorders that have a serious impact on a child’s educational and psychosocial outcome. SLI affects around 3%– 10% of children (Tomblin et al., 1997) and is diagnosed when oral language lags behind other areas of development for no apparent reason (L. B. Leonard, 1998). Similar prevalence levels are reported for developmental dyslexia, which is identified if a child has poor literacy skills despite adequate intelligence and opportunity to learn (Snowling, 2000). In both SLI and dyslexia, the diagnostic criteria specify that the child has to have adequate hearing and no major handicapping condition that might interfere with learning. For many years, research on these two disorders followed separate paths, with the study of SLI being largely carried out by speech and language pathologists, whereas dyslexia was the focus of educators and psychologists. In the 1960s dyslexia was frequently conceptualized as a visual perceptual disorder. However, over the past 30 years, there has been a shift of emphasis, with growing recognition that most children with dyslexia have major difficulties in phonological processing, that is, categorizing speech sounds and relating these to orthography (Snowling, 1987; Vellutino, 1987)."

The successful use of humor can increase status in both new and existing relationships, but unsuccessful humor attempts (e.g., inappropriate jokes) can harm status. The relationship between the successful use of humor and status is mediated by perceptions of confidence and competence. The successful use of humor signals confidence and competence, which in turn increases the joke teller’s status. Interestingly, telling both appropriate and inappropriate jokes, regardless of the outcome, signals confidence. Although signaling confidence typically increases status, telling inappropriate jokes signals low competence and the combined effect of high confidence and low competence harms status. Rather than conceptualizing humor as a frivolous or ancillary behavior, we argue that humor plays a fundamental role in shaping interpersonal perceptions and hierarchies within groups."

Despite the proliferation of kindergarten prediction studies (Book, 1974; Eaves, Ken dall, and Crichton, 1974; Feshbach, Adelman, and Fuller, 1977; Glazzard, 1982; Jansky and deHirsch, 1972; Perry, Guidubaldi, and Kehle, 1979; Satz, Taylor, Friel, and Fletcher, 1978; Taylor and Ivimey, 1980; Telegdy, 1975), there is a continuing concern that our interest in early prediction exceeds our capacity to identify children at risk for future failure (Lindsay and Wedell, 1982; Rubin, Balow, Dorle, and Rosen, 1978). It is possible that in our investigation of children's performance, we are not asking the right questions. The present study was based on the premise that linguis tic factors shown to be critical in the reading process are generally overlooked in kindergarten and first-grade screening instruments. Until recently, the most popular explanation of reading problems focused on purported deficits in visual perception and perceptual-motor skills. Major screening batteries reflected this research emphasis by including a wide range of perceptual-motor tasks (e.g., blocks, puzzles, drawing, sorting). It was not surprising, therefore, to find that training programs based on these batteries emphasized perceptual-motor train ing, almost to the exclusion of other aspects of functioning. Most re searchers now question the visual-perceptual deficit explanation of read ing disability and provide data that directly contradict it (Benton, 1975; Vellutino, 1977, 1979). There is now extensive documentation in the literature of the impor tance of language-based skills in reading achievement (Gleitman and Rozin, 1977; Liberman, 1982; Liberman and Shankweiler, 1979; Liber man, Shankweiler, Liberman, Fowler, and Fischer, 1977; Perfetti and Lesgold, 1977, 1979; Vellutino, 1977, 1979).

J. Simpson murder trial. Older and younger adults repeatedly recalled the event in a single session. Interviews were coded for amount and type of accurate information and for errors. The age groups did not differ in ability to recall the gist of the event or in the number of errors made. Younger adults were better at remembering when the event had occurred. Both age groups showed hypermnesia. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of autobiographi cal memory across the life span and the phenomenon of hypermnesia in everyday memory. Since Ebbinghaus (1964/1885), most research on memory has made use of experimenter-provided materials and has focused on how memory for those materials decays over time. This focus on memory decay and memory decrements has been especially pronounced in the study of memory in older adults. In contrast, this investigation examines improvement over time in memory for an autobiographical event (i.e., hypermnesia). Hypermnesia occurs when individuals are able to recall more information over repeated sessions even after they have indicated that they can recall nothing further. This memory effect has been demonstrated in a variety of laboratory tasks but has not been examined for autobiographical events. Thus, the first aim of this investigation was to assess whether recall level increases over repeated sessions when individuals recall an autobiographical event. Although research on the effects of aging on memory has increased in the past 10 years, researchers still know little about life span changes in autobiographical memory (for a review, see Cohen, 1998). Thus, our second aim was to examine whether age differences exist in adults' autobiographical memories for an important real-life event and whether older and younger adults differ in the extent to which they display hypermnesia."

Happy, sad, and neutral moods influenced the degree to which readers engaged in particular types of coherence-building processes in the service of comprehension.

The fiterature search produced 133 studies drawn from 17 countries. An analysis of U.S. studies found that conformity has declined since the 1950s. Results from 3 surveys were used to assess a country's individualism-collectivism, and for each survey the measures were found to be significantly related to conformity. Collectivist countries tended to show higher levels of conformity than individualist countries. Conformity research must attend more to cultural variables and to their role in the processes involved in social influence. The view has long been held that conformity is to some extent a product of cultural conditions, and it is a stable feature of popular stereotypes that some national groups are conforming and submissive, whereas others are independent and self-assertive (e.g., Peabody, 1985 ). Likewise, the extent to which dissidence is tolerated in a society will vary at different points in its history, and several commentators have suggested that the relatively high levels of conformity found in experiments conducted in the early 1950s (notably Asch, 1952b, 1956) was in part a product of the McCarthy era (e.g., Larsen, 1974; Mann, 1980; Perrin & Spencer, 1981 ). Although Asch's ( 1952b, 1956) seminal research is often interpreted as demonstrating that conformity is fundamental to group processes (Friend, Rafferty, & Bramel, 1990), Asch was as much concerned with those factors that enabled individuals to resist group pressure, factors which he saw as rooted in a society's values and socialization practices. That we have found the tendency to conformity in our society so strong that reasonably intelligent and well-meaning young people are willing to call White Black is a matter of concern. It raises questions about our ways of education and about the values that guide our conduct. (Asch, 1955, p. 34)"

Principal-components analyses demonstrated a dissociation in the factor structure of the Stroop trials between NC participants and AD patients, suggesting that disruption of semantic knowledge and speeded verbal processing in AD may be a major contributor to impairment on the incongruent trial. Results of clinicopathologic correlations in an autopsy-confirmed AD subgroup further suggest the invocation of a broad network of integrated cortical regions and executive and language processes underlying successful SCWT performance."

We also tested the mediating role of domain-specific academic self-efficacy and achievement goals in the relationships between perfectionism and achievement-related outcomes across math and English. In the direct path model, self-oriented perfectionism related positively to academic achievement and negatively to acceptability of cheating and academic procrastination. Socially prescribed perfectionism, in contrast, related positively to test anxiety, acceptability of cheating, and academic procrastination. In the mediation models, self-oriented perfectionism related consistently and positively to academic self-efficacy, a mastery goal, and a performance-approach goal in the domain. Socially prescribed perfectionism related consistently and positively to a performance-approach and a performance-avoidance goal. Academic self-efficacy and a mastery goal mediated the paths from self-oriented perfectionism to acceptability of cheating, academic procrastination, and achievement, while a performance-avoidance goal in English mediated the path from socially prescribed perfectionism to test anxiety. Many of the paths from perfectionism to outcomes were thus mediated by domain-specific motivation. The direct paths from the 2 perfectionism dimensions to academic procrastination remained significant, however, even in the presence of the intervening motivation variables."

Word reading skills were assessed by 3 word and nonword naming tasks. Good readers exhibited more orthographic priming than poor readers at both durations and more pseudohomophone priming at the short duration only. This suggests that good readers activate letter and phonemic information more efficiently than poor readers. Good readers also exhibited an equal amount of priming at both durations, whereas poor readers showed greater priming at the longer duration. This suggests that activation was not under strategic control. Finally, priming was reliable for both high- and low-frequency targets. This suggests that readers activate consistent information regardless of target word characteristics. Thus, quick, automatic, and general activation of orthographic and phonological information in skilled readers results from the precision and redundancy of their lexical representations. The role of phonological activation during the early stages of visual word recognition is perhaps the most actively debated issue in current research in reading. Some researchers have argued that phonological activation is more accurately characterized as a quick, automatic, and general process (Lukatela & Turvey, 1994a, 1994b; Perfetti & Bell, 1991; Van Orden, 1987), whereas others have claimed that phonological activation can be late, strategic, and rule based (Coltheart, 1978; Paap & Noel, 1991). Despite the centrality of this debate in the adult literature, there has been little research examining whether phonological activation is quick, automatic, and general in children. The present study attempts to fill this gap by examining age and naming-ability differences in orthographic and phonological priming in children.

The results of the 2 experiments with native German speakers yielded no significant differences: The reaction times were statistically identical for items from gender typical, ambiguous, and gender atypical groups. The 2 experiments with English bilinguals who had learned German as a second language (L2), however, provided evidence that the L2 word's termination plays a role in L2 gender processing. Participants were fastest when producing gender-marked noun phrases containing a noun with a gender typical termination and slowest when the noun had a gender atypical termination. Analogous results were obtained in the grammaticality judgment experiment.

In the first experiment, undergraduate subjects were exposed to slides of abstract geometric figures at both subliminal (i.e., 4 ms) and supraliminal exposure durations. Subjects1 attitudes toward the subliminally presented stimuli became significantly more positive with repeated exposures, even when subjects were unaware that exposures had occurred. Experiment 2 demonstrated that similar attitude changes are produced by subliminal exposure to photographs of actual persons. The results of Experiment 3 indicate that attitudes toward persons encountered in the natural environment of the psychology experiment are also enhanced by subliminal exposure to a photograph of that person. These findings are discussed in the context of prevailing models of mere exposure effects as well as an alternative psychodynamic model. Implications for research on attitudes, social cognition, and interpersonal object choice are also discussed. The investigation of subliminal and marginal phenomena represents an interface among the fields of personality, social, and cognitive psychology.

Here, we focus on interference related to the problem state, a directly accessible intermediate representation of the current state of a task. On the basis of Salvucci and Taatgen's (2008) threaded cognition theory, we predict interference if 2 or more tasks require a problem state but not when only one task requires one. This prediction was tested in a series of 3 experiments. In Experiment 1, a subtraction task and a text entry task had to be carried out concurrently. Both tasks were presented in 2 versions: one that required maintaining a problem state and one that did not. A significant overadditive interaction effect was observed, showing that the interference between tasks was maximal when both tasks required a problem state. The other 2 experiments tested whether the interference was indeed due to a problem state bottleneck, instead of cognitive load (Experiment 2: an alternative subtraction and text entry experiment) or a phonological loop bottleneck (Experiment 3: a triple-task experiment that added phonological processing). Both experiments supported the problem state hypothesis. To account for the observed behavior, computational cognitive models were developed using threaded cognition within the context of the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson, 2007). The models confirm that a problem state bottleneck can explain the observed interference."

In Experiment 1, both groups showed a short-term effect. Shortly after training, all students who participated in the regularized-reading condition showed better spelling performance than students who took part in a standard-reading condition. One week after training, spelling knowledge of students without learning disabilities appeared to be more stable than that of students with learning disabilities.

Results of a study of 132 newcomers with data collected at 4 unique time periods show a complex curvilinear pattern of job satisfaction, such that satisfaction reached a peak following organizational entry and decreased thereafter.

Thus, efficient ways of identifying need and prioritizing intervention are required. Despite this, children’s natural change is rarely formally considered when intervention planning. The role of age, gender and non-verbal IQ in predicting change has also not always been considered. A longitudinal baseline period is important because it may guide teachers and language therapists towards different therapeutic aims/methods for different groups of children. This study reports on 22 children aged 4–7 identified by teachers as having language difficulties. All children took part in a classroom-based semantic language intervention in two phases, the first led by speech and language therapists (SLTs), followed by a phase led by trained learning support assistants (LSAs). Two Natural Change subgroups were compared: One group showed natural change in language over a six-week period before the intervention ran (n = 11; Baseline Improvers) whilst the other group did not show language change in this non-intervention period (n = 12; Baseline Non-Improvers). The groups were well matched on skills at study entry and differed only on score change without intervention. Language skills were assessed at three subsequent time points: pre-therapy, post-SLT-therapy and post-LSA-therapy. In the group as a whole, significant changes were seen across all language measures except expressive vocabulary. Non-verbal cognitive ability showed no change over time, and did not predict language change. There were important differences in the patterns shown by each subgroup depending on natural change without intervention. Notably, Baseline Non-Improvers changed during intervention more than Baseline Improvers.

Two additional criterion tasks (name-face associative learning and grocery-list learning) were never mentioned during training. Two other groups were included: A strategy training group (who received strategy training and transfer instructions but not strategy-adaptation training) and a waiting-list control group. Both training procedures enhanced older adults’ performance on the trained tasks and those tasks that were discussed during training, but transfer was greatest after strategy-adaptation training.

According to one view this competitive process is language-specific, while another holds that it is language-nonspecific (i.e., lexical competition is cross-linguistic). In recent years, research on bilingual language production has seen the rise of a third view that postulates that lexical selection is in fact dynamic and may function as language-specific or nonspecific depending on a number of factors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the lexical selection process among moderately proficient bilinguals whose two languages are typologically distant: Tunisian Arabic and French. The picture-word interference task was used in two experiments where moderately proficient Tunisian Arabic (L1)-French (L2) bilinguals were asked to name pictures in their L2 while ignoring auditory distractors (semantic, phono-translation, phonological, or unrelated) in their L2 (Experiment 1) or their L1 (Experiment 2). Thus, the language context was entirely monolingual in Experiment 1 and bilingual in Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, only a phonological facilitation effect was observed. In Experiment 2, interference was found in the phono-translation, semantic, and phonological conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-language competition occurs among moderately proficient Tunisian Arabic-French bilinguals only in a bilingual context (Experiment 2) as indexed by the phono-translation interference effect observed. Our findings are in line with the recent hypothesis that lexical selection is a dynamic process modulated by factors like language similarity, language proficiency, and the experimental language context."

Subjects were 8to 11-year-old children of at least average IQ who had been referred to a university clinic for assessment. All subjects were clinic referrals, but only half were severely reading-disabled. Both short-term memory and naming speed were effective predictors of performance on two reading subtests, even when nonverbal IQ was statistically controlled. Controlling for verbal intelligence, either by statistical means or by stringent selection criteria, reduced considerably the contribution of memory measures to reading. However, digit-naming speed remained a significant contributor to reading achievement. Thus, the authors found some evidence that dyslexics may have a specific deficit in naming automaticity."

We describe the interactive development of orthographic and phonological codes, and we discuss the methodological problems that may have led to underestimating the importance of individual differences in orthographic processing in our account of reading disabilities. Symbol naming speed is typically subsumed under phonological processing, yet it contributes variance to reading, especially to reading fluency, independently of phonological awareness. We speculate that naming speed may reflect precise timing mechanisms necessary to the development of orthographic codes and to their integration with phonological codes. We argue that an understanding of this precise timing dimension is necessary to incorporate in our models of phonological, orthographic, and semantic processes in reading acquisition and reading failure."

Whether such skill plays as crucial a role in gaining orthographic knowledge, as it does in learning to decode words based on symbol-sound correspondences, is a matter of debate. Some theorists contend that poor development of letter-sound knowledge (Ehri, 1992) and insufficient reading experience or exposure to print (Stanovich, 1992) play the major roles in the orthographic skill deficits of reading disabled (RD) children. We wish to supplement this view by proposing that a largely independent individual difference factor, indexed by speed of naming simple visual symbols such as single digits or letters, has a significant effect upon learning and retrieving orthographic patterns. The reading disabled child typically has difficulties in both phonemic sensitivity and in orthographic processing. We argue that the reading disabled child’s failure to abstract orthographic regularity after repeated print exposure and consequent difficulty acquiring automatic word recognition (Venezky & Massaro, 1979) may be due to slow access to letter codes as well as to the spiralling effects of initially poor decoding and restricted reading experience."

In Experiments 1 and 2, predictions from GPC and orthographic rime unit accounts converged, but in Experiments 3 and 4 they diverged. Experiment 1 showed that when nonword orthographic rimes were used to prime consistent regular words (e.g., mist) and atypically irregular words (e.g., pint), reliable priming was observed for regular words, but priming of atypically irregular words occurred only in the 2nd block of trials, after the orthographic rime prime itself had been primed by the Block 1 presentation of the target word. In subsequent experiments, only the 1st block of trials was examined. Experiment 2 replicated the selective priming of consistent regular words observed in Block 1 of Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, nonword orthographic rimes were as effective at priming typically irregular target words (e.g., grind) as they were in priming inconsistent but typically regular target words (e.g., flint). Parallel results were observed in Experiment 4, in which nonword orthographic rimes were as effective at priming target words with typically irregular orthographic rimes as they were in priming consistent regular target words.

Children were given multiple measures of key constructs, i.e. word-level reading, serial naming of both alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric items, phonological processing ability, articulation rate and global processing speed. The robust association between alphanumeric naming speed and reading within fourth-grade children was largely mediated by phonological processing ability. Markedly different patterns of results were observed for naming speed for letters and digits and naming speed for colours and pictures in children of this age. Relative to the latter, alphanumeric naming speed better assesses an underlying phonological processing ability that is common to word-reading ability. We argue that item identification processes contribute little to individual differences in alphanumeric naming speed within relatively proficient readers and that the extent to which alphanumeric naming speed primarily reflects phonological processing is likely to vary with the level of overlearning of letters and numbers and their names."

Children silently read a series of short stories, each containing six repetitions of a different target non-word. They subsequently read target non-words faster than homophones and preferred target non-words to homophones in an orthographic choice task, indicating that they had formed functional orthographic representations of the target non-words through phonologically recoding them during silent story reading. Target non-word orthographic choice was correlated with all measures bar non-symbol naming speed. The association between phonological recoding efficiency and orthographic learning lends support to the hypothesis that self-teaching occurs through phonological recoding even in silent reading.

This illustrates the need for better understanding of the relapse process to thereby improve cessation treatments. While the impact of stress sensitivity on relapse is clear, little research has precisely examined stress reactivity in addicted individuals. Further, most research on relapse focuses on affect surrounding self-administration, and doesn't address potentially important pre-consumption processes such as anticipation of use. We examined the effects of anticipation and actual smoking on stress reactivity in 34 deprived smokers withdrawn for 24 hours and 37 non-deprived smokers, with 37 non-smoker controls. Using a cued shock stressor task, we measured stress reactivity via startle potentiation and self-reported anxiety. After completing the task once, smokers anticipated smoking a cigarette resting in front of them while they completed the task a second time. Smokers then smoked before completing the task a third and final time. Non-smokers anticipated and drank water as a control. Anticipation of smoking significantly attenuated both startle potentiation and self-reported anxiety to shock cues for deprived smokers relative to non-deprived smokers. Smokers' stress reactivity was not reduced by smoking beyond the prior effect of anticipation. These results suggest that anticipation, rather than actual drug consumption, may drive the primary reinforcing effect of reduced stress reactivity in smoking. Future research is needed to understand this effect of anticipation on drug use and determine whether anticipation would make an effective intervention target for addiction and other psychopathology which exhibits increased stress sensitivity."

Implementation of evidence-based, universal preventive interventions that simultaneously teach prosocial behavior and academic skills can assist schools in promoting healthy academic and social development among all students (Greenberg et al., 2003; Gresham, 2004; Walker, Ramsay, & Gresham, 2004). Yet there are relatively few educational and social–emotional preventive interventions that have been shown through rigorously designed randomized controlled trials to produce long-term educational outcomes (Catalano, Berglund, Ryan, Lonczak, & Hawkins, 2002; Durlak & Wells, 1997).

The need for efficacious programs is particularly great in urban communities, where the risk for school failure and early school leaving is considerably increased (Institute of Education Sciences, 2007; Perie, Grigg, & Donahue, 2005). The current study examined the longitudinal impacts of two first-grade universal preventive interventions targeting the early antecedent risk behaviors of poor academic achievement and aggressive/disruptive behavior and their distal correlates in a sample of urban, primarily African American children. Although both prevention programs were aimed to promote a range of outcomes related to classroom learning, one program focused on the proximal influence of the classroom environment, whereas the other program focused on the Family–School partnership. By increasing understanding of the academic outcomes associated these types of universal preventive interventions, the current study could inform both policy and practice related to the future use of family- versus classroom-focused universal prevention programs in early elementary school."

Some influential “slot” models of working memory capacity suggest that people always represent 3–4 objects and that only the fidelity with which these objects are represented is affected by object complexity. The primary evidence supporting this claim is the finding that people can detect large changes to complex objects (consistent with remembering at least 4 individual objects), but that small changes cannot be detected (consistent with low-resolution representations). Here we show that change detection with large changes greatly overestimates individual item capacity when people can use global representations of the display to detect such changes. When the ability to use such global ensemble or texture representations is reduced, people remember individual information about only 1–2 complex objects. This finding challenges models that propose people always remember a fixed number of objects, regardless of complexity, and supports a more flexible model with an important role for spatial ensemble representations."

The theory is then embedded in a hidden Markov model that measures all 3 processes with low-burden tasks that are appropriate for even young children. These techniques are applied to a large corpus of developmental studies of recall, yielding stable findings about the emergence of dual memory processes between childhood and young adulthood and generating tests of many theoretical predictions. The techniques are extended to the study of healthy aging and to the memory sequelae of common forms of neurocognitive impairment, resulting in a theoretical framework that is unified over 4 major domains of memory research: early development, mainstream adult research, aging, and neurocognitive impairment. The techniques are also extended to recognition, creating a unified dual process framework for recall and recognition."

According to Wagner and Torgesen (1987), phonological processing consists of 3 distinct constructs: phonological awareness (PA), rapid automatized naming (RAN), and the phonological loop (PL) of working memory. The present study examined whether this phonological processing model which was originally developed for English orthography is also applicable to a more transparent language such as German. Furthermore, we tested whether the structure of phonological processing is invariant across typically achieving children and children with RD. Therefore, 209 German-speaking 3rd graders (100 typical learners and 109 children with RD) completed a comprehensive test battery assessing PA, RAN, and PL. Using confirmatory factor analyses, we compared the latent structure of these phonological processing skills across both groups. The study yielded 3 important findings: First, Wagner and Torgesen’s (1987) model transfers to the German language and its orthography with transparent grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences. Second, the tripartite structure of phonological processing was evident across both groups (factorial invariance). Third, group invariance was also found for the measurement and structural components of the model (measurement invariance). These findings suggest that the nature of phonological processing is invariant across typically achieving children and children with RD acquiring the transparent orthography of German.

Four studies, using both conventional and unconventional target groups, find support for an integrative perspective. People high in openness do appear more tolerant of diverse worldviews compared with people low in openness; however, at the same time, people both high and low in openness are more intolerant of groups whose worldviews conflict with their own.

We tested our approach in three experiments. In Experiment 1, we found list length effects for homogeneous photographs of flowers and landscapes. In Experiment 2 and 3, we presented heterogeneous photographs of scenes (Experiment 2) and faces (Experiment 3). List length effects were only found if these photographs were homogenized by the use of image-processing filters.

Participants imagined either gains or nonlosses (i.e., net gains) or losses or nongains (i.e., net losses). Participants discriminated more when the identical event was framed as the presence (gains and losses) versus the absence (nonlosses and nongains) of an outcome, presumably because the latter is harder to represent. Discrimination was enhanced when the motivational features of the imagined event were either both the same as or both different from a person's selfdiscrepancy. Discrimination was reduced when only one of the motivational features was different. A model of excitations, inhibitions, and disinhibitions between mental representation is suggested to account for these findings. When people perceive an increase in the loudness of a tone as a result of an increase in its sound pressure, their sensory apparatus discriminates between these two physical sound pressures. They experience this increase in stimulus intensity as an increase in loudness. A highly discriminating sensory system tracks the slightest variation of stimulus intensity. It is sensitive to differences in stimulus intensity, such as sound pressure differences. In contrast, a nondiscriminat ing system does not detect variations in stimulus intensity, even when they are fairly large. Such a system is insensitive to differences in stimulus intensity. Different sensory systems can have different discriminations or one system can have different discriminations as a function of specific variables. Positive and negative events can also have different stimulus intensities.

These were supported in 3 experiments comparing clearly positive or negative categories to nonwords. They also provided evidence that participants shift their response criterion when doing the IAT. Because of these criterion shifts, a response pattern in the IAT can have multiple causes. Thus, it is not possible to infer a single cause (such as prejudice) from IAT results. A surprising additional result was that nonwords were treated as though they were evaluated more negatively than obviously negative items like insects, suggesting that low familiarity items may generate the pattern of data previously interpreted as evidence for implicit prejudice."

Based on previous research, we predicted divergent results based on a two-factor model of psychopathy (interpersonal-affective traits and impulsive-antisocial traits). Specifically, we predicted that the unique variance of interpersonal-affective traits would be related to increased monitoring (i.e., error-related negativity) and adjusting to errors (i.e., post-error slowing), whereas impulsive-antisocial traits would be related to reductions in these processes. Three studies using a diverse selection of assessment tools, samples, and methods are presented to identify response monitoring correlates of the two main factors of psychopathy. In Studies 1 (undergraduates), 2 (adolescents), and 3 (offenders), interpersonal-affective traits were related to increased adjustment following errors and, in Study 3, to enhanced monitoring of errors. Impulsive-antisocial traits were not consistently related to error adjustment across the studies, although these traits were related to a deficient monitoring of errors in Study 3. The results may help explain previous mixed findings and advance implications for etiological models of psychopathy."
START,START,1993250134,understanding behavior of organizations to improve behavior in organizations,2004,dale m brethower,the behavior analyst today,1,3,3,"Human behavior occurs in an environment. The environment is usually a family, social group, work group, school, or workplace. Each of these environments is a system, with systemic properties and dynamics that influence how that system interacts with a person's behavior. Behavioral systems analysis combines principles of behavior analysis and system analysis to understand how to improve behavior of persons and of organizations. Behavior analysis is powerful but has specific limitations. Behavioral systems analysis was invented to deal with the limitations and build on the poser of behavior analysis. Six foundational notions that guide behavioral systems analysis are presented. The six notions can be found in or abstracted from the management literature and the general systems literature, but applying the foundational notions requires careful integration of systems principles and behavioral principles. Ongoing work by Rummler and others is testing and validating specific techniques for use of behavioral and systems principles within the context of living organizations. Keywords: Behavioral systems analysis; systems principles; organizational behavior. Introduction--six questions Please allow me to set the stage for a discussion of behavior of and in organizations by giving brief answers to 6 questions: 1. Where does behavior occur? In an environment. The environment for much interesting behavior of individuals is the family or an organization such as a school or workplace; the environment for an organization is the marketplace or service area. 2. What controls/influences/guides behavior? Environmental variables. Specific environmental variables interacting with behavior that is conditioned by the individual's genetic and learning history and by the organization's relationships with customers or clients and suppliers. 3. Why is it important to know what controls/influences/guides behavior? If I know, I can be more effective more often as a parent or teacher or child care worker or supervisor or manager or leader or member of a family, social group, or work group. 4. Why is behavior analysis important? It is a way of understanding the interactions between a specific behavior and the environment. It is a way of understanding why individuals behave as they do, not in an abstract sense but in terms of very specific behaviors and very specific and measurable variables. It is a way of understanding what one must do to be more effective as a self-manager, friend, family member, manager, leader etc. 5. What do we know about families, social groups, and work groups as well as schools, workplaces, and other organizations? We know that they are systems. 6. What is a system? A set of interconnected variables--and the physical material and energy that enables the variables to function. We have always known that behavior occurs in an environment but understanding that the environment is a system is not well known. Or at least, the implications of ""environment as system"" are not well known. The purpose of this paper is to help clarify some of the implications of understanding ""environment as system."" I will do so by explaining why a few well-known behaviorists had to invent the field of behavioral systems analysis, a field that attempts to show what controls the environmental variables that, in turn, impact behavior. (The short version is that we had to do it if we were to develop schools and workplaces that support functional human behavior.) Behavior Analysis, by itself, is powerful Behavioral analysis is extremely powerful. The power is demonstrated in: * dozens of research papers published each year * dozens of books published in the past decade, and * Hundreds of sessions presented at the International Association for Behavior Analysis, the American Association for Behavior Therapy, and other professional associations each year. …"

NA Three experiments (overall N = 219) also (a) provided comparative data for participants who were interviewed using the open-ended Self-Administered Interview (Gabbert, Hope, & Fisher, 2009) or one of two “report everything” open-ended procedures, (b) tested the efficacy of the procedure using both written and verbal interviews, and (c) examined the generality of the findings across different encoding stimuli which required variations in the types of cued recall questions asked. NA Coarse-grain reporting seldom occurred under the free recall interview conditions. NA Witnesses provided abundant coarse-grain details when required to respond to probes about specific details (i.e., cued recall forced report conditions) – without obvious cost to overall accuracy relative to accuracy of similar detail reported under free recall conditions – regardless of whether they responded on a written questionnaire or in a face-to-face individual interview. NA These experiments suggest that a procedure that requires cued recall forced reporting of coarse-grain detail may offer potential in certain investigative situations as an adjunct to the widely recommended open-ended forensic interviewing techniques.
Public Significance Statement. NA Witnesses to crimes sometimes volunteer inaccurate fine-grain detail (e.g., purple getaway car) rather than accurate coarse-grain or broad detail (e.g., dark-colored getaway car) despite the latter being potentially valuable in some investigative contexts (e.g., review of CCTV footage). NA Requiring witnesses to give coarse-grain or general answers to interviewers’ questions produced a substantial amount of accurate information that was not volunteered in open-ended interviews, suggesting a possible way of supplementing currently recommended open-interviewing techniques."

These claims include the existence of a long-term perceptual memory system supporting conscious experience separate to episodic memory; greater involvement of perceptual memory in the response to emotion-laden and personally meaningful events; increased perceptual memory intrusions accompanied by impaired episodic memory for the traumatic event among PTSD patients; and a lack of association, or inverse association, between indices of voluntary recall and involuntary images relating to the same traumatic materials. In this article I review current research on perceptual memory, which supports the presence of long-term representations that are selective or incomplete reflections of sensory input. The functional independence of perceptual and episodic memory is illustrated by research on verbal overshadowing but is most clearly exemplified by the strong evidence in favor of enhanced perceptual memory and impaired episodic memory in PTSD. Theoretical predictions concerning the relation between perceptual priming and the development of intrusive images, the effect of verbal versus visuospatial secondary tasks on intrusive trauma images, and the independence of voluntary and involuntary memory for the same materials have garnered widespread support. Reasons for the continuing controversy over traumatic memory are discussed, and some implications of the review for general theories of recall and recognition, clinical theories of PTSD, and �special mechanism� views of memory are set out.

Results indicated that whereas acceleration improved reading performance in both groups, auditory masking was beneficial to dyslexic children only. Furthermore, a combined condition of both acceleration and masking was the most effective in enhancing dyslexic children's comprehension. It is argued that because normal readers use the phonological route quite effectively, its masking is detrimental to performance. On the other hand, auditory masking reduces the impact of the presumed phonological impairment of dyslexic children. Analysis of decoding mistakes suggested that both manipulations might have resulted in a more effective utilization of orthographic information and enhanced top-down context effects for dyslexic and novice readers."

Some scholars and practitioners, focused on promoting ""school readiness,"" frame the problem as weak parenting, signaled by insufficient rich language or academic skills. Other theorists, rooted in ecocultural theory, argue that early socialization and cognitive engagement are culturally situated within routine home activities. These activity structures vary and change over time as families acculturate, adapting to local social ecologies. Little is known empirically about the activity structures within Latino homes, including how young children participate. We detail the social architecture and cognitive engagement pertaining to 6 prevalent home activities in which 24 Mexican American 4-year-olds were engaged over 14 months. We then report how children participate in these 6 activities, and their potential relevance to the cognitive skills gap seen at school entry. We found that children's activities reproduced heritage language, symbols, and knowledge less often than suggested in prior literature; children's typical level of cognitive engagement varied greatly among tasks; and the distribution of time spent in activities is associated with the mother's school attainment and home language."

Both anger and disgust are associated with feeling unpleasant as well as experiencing a sense of confidence, whereas surprise and awe tend to be more pleasant emotions that are associated with doubt. Most prior work has examined how appraisals (confidence, pleasantness) lead people to experience different emotions or to experience different levels of intensity within the same emotion. Instead, the current research focused on the consequences (rather the antecedents) of appraisals of emotion, and it focuses specifically on the consequences for thought usage rather than the consequences for generating many or few thoughts. We show that when these four emotions are induced following thought generation, thoughts can be used either more or less with each emotion depending on whether the pleasantness/unpleasantness or confidence/doubt appraisal is made salient. In five experiments, it was predicted and found that anger and disgust following thought generation led to more thought use than surprise and awe when a confidence appraisal for the emotion was encouraged, but led to less thought use than surprise and awe when a pleasantness appraisal was made salient.

The primary goal of the present study was to determine the predictive utility of partner-ratings of personality above and beyond self-ratings for explaining dyadic adjustment in a community sample of committed heterosexual couples (N = 87). This research was embedded within a Big Three model of personality, using both self- and other-rating measures that tap the core of these broad dimensions of personality and other specific trait facets across the normal-abnormal spectrum. An actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) was used, which estimates both actor (self) and partner effects, and models interdependence that is inherent in dyadic data. Both men and women reported greater relationship discord to the extent that they rated their partners as high in negative temperament and disinhibition, and low in positive temperament, controlling for self-ratings of personality. Further, partner-ratings of numerous other specific trait scales were uniquely associated with dyadic adjustment, providing considerable detailed information about personality-adjustment relations beyond the core of the 3 broad trait dimensions. Results of the present study highlight the importance of routinely assessing both self- and partner-ratings of personality, from both partners of a dyad, to explain intimate-relationship quality more fully and accurately.

The so-called privileged Jews include prisoners in the Nazi-operated camps and ghettos who held positions that gave them access to material and other benefits, while compelling them to act in ways that have been judged detrimental to fellow inmates. Although the issue of ""privileged"" Jews has been largely neglected, it relates to a crucial facet of the Holocaust and has vast implications for its aftermath. The ethical dilemmas facing these victims may be closely linked to what Lawrence Langer has termed choiceless choices, which challenge conventional notions of ""judgment"" and ""responsibility."" This problem is also the primary subject of Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi’s essay titled ""The Grey Zone,"" which is arguably the most influential essay ever written on the Holocaust. Levi argues that one should abstain from judging individuals who confronted such extreme circumstances, positioning prisoners with ""privileged"" positions at the threshold of representation and understanding. However, moral evaluations of ""privileged"" Jews have a strong impact on Holocaust testimonies, whether these were constructed during the war or recorded long after the survivors’ experiences. The examples of video testimonies explored in this article reveal that this is particularly the case when interviewees are former ""privileged"" Jews and interviewers are themselves Holocaust survivors.

Following J. Baron and C. Strawson (1976), naming performance was measured as a function of skill with each route, using sets of stimuli varying in reliance on either route. ""Phoenicians"" were defined to be better with rules than with look-up; ""Chinese"" were better at look-up than with rules. As predicted by J. Baron and C. Strawson, Phoenicians named low-frequency regular words and nonwords faster than Chinese. Contrary to predictions, Phoenicians were also faster at naming irregular words of various frequencies. Implications of these results for various dual-route models versus single-route models are discussed. The dual-route model of word naming (Coltheart, 1978) is still accepted in some form by most theorists, although there have been challenges (Glushko, 1979; Humphreys & Evett, 1985; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989; Van Orden, Pennington, & Stone, 1990). According to the standard version of the model, words can be named in either of two ways. One, referred to as the assembly route, is based on the idea that readers use knowledge of common spelling-tosound relationships to derive a likely set of sounds that are then assembled into a complete phonological code. The second, referred to as the lexical route, is based on use of word-specific association mechanisms. Readers identify the word as a pattern that allows them to access the appropriate location in lexical memory and then retrieve the corresponding phonological code. There has been considerable debate about the nature of the assembly route (Brown & Besner, 1987; Carr & Pollatsek, 1985; Paap & Noel, 1991; Patterson & Coltheart, 1987; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989; Van Orden, Johnston, & Hale, 1988).

There is evidence of this: we speak iambics in conversation with each other very often. . . .""Aristotle in PoeticsMuch work on speech rhythm has been driven far more by a desire to classify languages into categories than by the need to elucidate the actual rhythms of spoken utterances. Common approaches to speech rhythm focus, for example, on the variability of syllabic durations within utterances (Grabe & Low, 2002) or the proportion of an utterance's duration that is occupied by vowels (Ramus, Nespor, & Mehler, 1999). But these features do not specify actual rhythms-that is, the temporal patterns of syllable onsets within an utterance-and instead reduce whole languages to descriptive statistics. Knowing that English is 40% vocalic (Ramus et al., 1999) indicates little about the timing of syllable onsets within any given English utterance, even though this information may be useful in differentiating English taxonomically from languages having different types of syllable structure.Outside of linguistics, though, representations of sentence rhythms are commonplace, and it is unclear why such representations have not had a larger impact on linguistic theories. Poetic verse, song, Shakespearean dialogue, and rap are all based on musical notions of the periodicity of syllable onsets. Consider the rhythmic transcription of the text of the children's song Twinkle Twinkle shown in Figure 1a. The rhythm is organized as a two-beat cycle alternating between strong and weak beats. The relative onset-time and relative duration of every syllable in the sentence is specified, hence making this a true representation of a rhythm. Next, the stressed syllables of the disyllabic words fall on the strong beats of the two-beat cycle (i.e., the downbeats), whereas the unstressed syllables fall on the weak beats. Finally, we see that even silence is specified in this transcription in the form of the rest that sits in between ""star"" and ""How,"" in this case indicating a sentence break.Regardless of the fact that Twinkle Twinkle is a poetic form of speech, its transcription effectively captures the basic elements of what a model of speech rhythm should describe: (a) it specifies a unit of rhythm, in this case the two-beat metrical units that make up each measure of the transcription; (b) it specifies the relative onset-time and relative duration of every syllable in the sentence; and (c) it represents not only the duration but the weight (i.e., stress) of each syllable in the sentence, such that prominent syllables fall on strong beats. Each of these three elements has been analyzed in isolation in various models of speech rhythm, but they have rarely been synthesized into a unified model. These three elements have been analyzed, respectively, in isochrony models, rhythm metrics, and metrical phonology. We briefly review these three traditions in phonology before mentioning the only integrated account that we know of, namely Joshua Steele's 1775, treatise An Essay Toward Establishing the Melody and Measure of Speech to be Expressed and Perpetuated by Peculiar Symbols. In our study, we report a test of a critical prediction of a musical model of speech, namely, that the production of time intervals between stressed syllables (here called ""prominence groups"") is based on a music-like representation of metrical structure. In particular, the ""meter"" of speech can serve to stabilize the timing of prominence groups when the timing of individual syllables varies. At the same time, speech (like music) can feature changes in meter that lead to commensurate changes in the timing of prominence groups.Isochrony ModelsThe first issue for speech rhythm relates to specifying a unit of rhythm. Lloyd James (1940, quoted in Pike, 1945) contrasted languages having a rhythm similar to a machine gun with those having a rhythm similar to Morse code. Pike (1945) classified such languages as syllable-timed and stress-timed, respectively, a categorization that is often referred to as the ""rhythm class hypothesis"" (Abercrombie, 1967; Grabe & Low, 2002). …"

Study 2 establishes a nomological network around this construct, examining the relationship of temporal distancing to other theoretically related constructs. Study 3 tests whether people high in temporal distancing (i.e., “high temporal distancers”) experience greater concurrent well-being, including greater positive affect and life satisfaction and lesser negative affect, worry, and depressive symptoms.

Finally, Studies 5a–5c explore a key way in which temporal distancing may support psychological well-being—by facilitating more adaptive responses to negative experiences. Our results demonstrate that the tendency to temporally distance from negative experiences predicts a more positive profile of affective experiences and stress-reactivity that may support immediate and longer-term well-being. Moreover, many of these findings remained significant when controlling for general reappraisal tendencies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

Structural equation modeling identified a significant Age x Depression interaction in relation to visual search for measures of WP variability but not for mean reaction time. Older more depressed adults exhibited greater variability. WP variability in executive function and other cognitive constructs covaried, and the significant Age x Depression interaction with visual search was accounted for by WP variability in executive control.

I believe this view to be mistaken. It rests on overinterpreting experiments. It also often rests on assuming that one must choose between taking these individuals to be mentalists and taking them to be behaviorists. This assumption underestimates a powerful nonmentalistic, nonbehavioristic explanatory scheme that centers on attributing action with targets and on causation of action by interlocking, internal conative, and sensory states. Neither action with targets, nor conative states, nor sensing entails mentality. The scheme can attribute conative states and relations (to targets), efficiency, sensory states and relations (to sensed entities), sensory retention, sensory anticipation, affect, and appreciation of individual differences. The scheme can ground explanations of false belief tests that do not require infants or nonhuman animals to use language. After the scheme is explained and applied, it is contrasted with other, superficially similar schemes proposed in the literature-for example, those of Gergely and Csibra, Wellman and Gopnik, Perner and Roessler, Flavell, and Apperly and Butterfill.

Recent developmental research suggests that children by the age of 6 begin to value ideas over labor. Yet, much less is known about whether adults similarly attribute a higher value to ideas and idea givers than to labor and idea executors. In seven studies (N = 1,463), we explored the relative valuation of ideas versus labor in adults, its mechanisms and boundary conditions. Participants learned about an idea giver and a laborer who collaborated to create a product and indicated who deserves ownership and monetary compensation for the product. Contrary to what has been reported for children, Studies 1a–1c found that participants valued the contribution of the laborer more than the contribution of the idea giver. This labor-valuation effect emerged even when participants themselves were idea givers (Study 1b), and it was replicated across different populations (including legal professionals, Study 1c) and contexts (e.g., art works and businesses, Study 2). Studies 3a and 3b established perceived effort as a central psychological process behind the labor-valuation effect. Finally, Study 4 extended the effect to the realm of praise and blame judgments, showing that laborers receive more praise for positive outcomes, but less blame for negative outcomes, relative to idea givers. The current findings may provide a useful framework for understanding the role of effort in lay people’s valuation of ideas and labor, thereby bridging research on creativity, effort, and valuation judgments."

In addition, this new version of the task allows the assessment of the accuracy of gaze following. Marmosets precisely extrapolate gaze direction, past distracting objects and from considerable distances, thereby meeting the criteria of so-called geometrical gaze following.

One explanation for the co-occurrence of proactive prosociality in these species is that it is linked to shared infant care (cooperative breeding); alternatively, it might merely reflect unusually high social tolerance or be mediated by advanced cognitive abilities. To date, distinguishing between these alternative explanations is difficult, partly because available evidence is restricted to only a handful of species and partly because methodological differences thwart comparisons across studies. Here, we present an experimental paradigm called group service, which allows estimation of both social tolerance and proactive prosociality in group settings. Its simplicity makes it intuitively plausible to subjects and allows testing a broad variety of species, including in zoos. We applied the test to independently breeding Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), cooperatively breeding common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), and capuchin monkeys with an intermediate breeding system. Social tolerance was slightly higher in marmosets than capuchins and much higher in both compared to macaques, but only marmosets provided a service to other group members. Furthermore, we validated the group service paradigm in the common marmosets by comparing their performance to earlier data. Although our results are consistent with the cooperative breeding hypothesis, a comprehensive evaluation requires adding data from additional groups and species, which should be facilitated by the group service approach."

This study evaluates the psychometric properties of the Antisocial Beliefs and Attitudes Scale (ABAS), a developmentally sensitive measure of young people's beliefs and attitudes toward social standards of acceptable behavior at home and at school. The reliability and validity of the ABAS was assessed in a sample of British school children (N = 486) aged 9-16 years (M = 12.79, SD = 1.90) and male young offenders (N = 84) aged 13-17 years (M = 15.15, SD = 0.27). Participants completed the ABAS, together with a self-report measure of antisocial behavior; maternal reports of antisocial activity were also collected in the offending sample. Confirmatory factor analysis replicated the 2-factor structure of Rule Noncompliance and Peer Conflict previously derived from a sample of Canadian school children, and these factors showed good test-retest reliability. Rule Noncompliance predicted self-reported antisocial behavior for ages 11-16 years, while Peer Conflict predicted antisocial behavior for ages 9-16 years. Comparisons between young offenders and an age-matched subsample of males from the school group showed significant differences. In young offenders, Rule Noncompliance and Peer Conflict were significantly predictive of self-reported antisocial behavior, while Rule Noncompliance independently predicted mothers' ratings of their sons' antisocial behavior.

Survivor testimonies and confessions of former informants are analyzed as instances of public remembering which straddle historical and psychological enquiries: they are, at the same time, stories of individual fates, replete with references to psychological states, motives and cognitions, and discourses of history, NA part of a socially and institutionally mediated collective struggle with a painful, unsettling, or traumatic past. Also, the examples point to two different ways in which archives are relevant to the study of human experience. In the case of Holocaust survivor testimony, personal recollections are usually documented in order to be systematically archived and made part of the official record of the past, while in the case of collaboration with the security services, it is the opening of the ‘official’ archives, and the fallout from this development, that made the confessions and public apologies necessary. The article argues that discursive psychology’s emphasis on remembering as a dynamic, performative and rhetorical practice, situated in a specific social and historical context offers a particularly productive way of exploring the interplay between personal experience and the institutional production of historical knowledge, one that helps to address some of the challenges encountered by psychologists and historians interested in researching accounts of troubled past."

The toy has two basic modes: 1) open discovery, in which children use a pen-like device to touch the interface and receive auditory feedback (usually cute sound effects or songs) and 2) structured games, which ask children to do specific tasks like, ""With your pen, touch the scarecrow with three red triangles."" Each successfully accomplished task is followed by raucous celebration on the part of the toy, usually in the form of a cartoon character saying something like, ""Good job!"" or ""Way to go!"" As we played, I began to notice that my daughter was showing less and less interest in the structured games. Despite the toy's hyperbolic celebrations of her mastery, she quickly grew bored. I encouraged her to keep playing, but she looked at me and asked, ""Do you want to hold the pen, Daddy?"" So I kept playing. But the more I played, the more I realized that the toy was celebrating the accomplishment of extremely easy, mindless tasks that all had exactly one correct way of being done. Ironically, this ""toy"" was utterly joyless. Yet it is marketed as an ""interactive"" toy that teaches ""pre-reading, pre-writing and other preschool skills to prepare children for the first day of school."" But I shouldn't have been so surprised. I knew better. I had seen the same joyless approach back in October 2005 when I toured Confluence Academy, an Edison-run school located in one of the most economically disadvantaged areas in the heart of inner-city St. Louis. I saw the same boredom in the faces of the students then that I saw in my daughter's when she was playing with the LeapFrog toy. I saw the teachers celebrate a similar mindless mastery of task-specific skills. I saw the same approach to preparing children for what lies ahead of them. Of course, the difference between my daughter and the children at Confluence Academy was that my daughter had the freedom to get up and do something else. But at Confluence, the children--heavily disciplined and shamed into passive subjugation--sat in silence and did as they were told. It's not that I object to Edison or to Confluence Academy per se. I understand that they are logical expressions of our contemporary system of education, especially the way that we educate poor minority children. Edison is profiting--literally and metaphorically--from the Bush Administration's No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act. And Confluence is simply following federal and corporate marching orders. But Confluence and Edison are symptoms of a much larger social disease, a disease that creates the conditions for these companies to exist and thrive and for these schools to be regarded as models for our future. Educational management organizations (EMOs) such as Edison are a growth industry. The 2004 report ""Profiles of For-Profit Education Management Companies"" from Arizona State University showed that 59 EMOs were managing 535 schools and enrolling approximately 239,766 students in 24 states and D.C., an increase of eight firms and 39,363 students over the previous 12 months. In 2004 Edison--the largest EMO--ran 109 public schools serving over 70,000 students in 20 states and D.C., including two in St. Louis and two in Kansas City.

For example, when trying to gauge how much someone else enjoys a television show, people might think ""How much do I enjoy it?"" and use this answer as basis for estimating others' reactions. Although personal experience (such as actually watching the show oneself) often improves empathic accuracy, we found that gaining too much experience can impair it. Five experiments highlight a desensitization bias in emotional perspective taking, with consequences for social prediction, social judgment, and social behavior. Participants who viewed thrilling or shocking images many times predicted first-time viewers would react less intensely (Experiments 1 and 2); participants who heard the same funny joke or annoying noise many times estimated less intense reactions of first-time listeners (Experiments 3 and 4); and further, participants were less likely to actually share good jokes and felt less bad about blasting others with annoying noise after they themselves became desensitized to those events (Experiments 3-5). These effects were mediated by participants' own attenuated reactions. Moreover, observers failed to anticipate this bias, believing that overexposed participants (i.e., repeatedly exposed participants who became desensitized) would make better decisions on their behalf (Experiment 5). Taken together, these findings reveal a novel paradox in emotional perspective taking: If people experience an evocative event many times, they may not become wiser companions but worse, unable to disentangle self-change from other-oriented thinking. Just as lacking exposure to others' experiences can create gaps in empathy and understanding, so may gaining too much. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)"

According to the data, readers represented modus ponens deductions as certain, except when it was only a weakly necessary cause of a given effect. They represented any logically invalid inferences resulting from affirming the conditional consequent as hypothetical, except when it was the effect of strongly sufficient cause. Accordingly, readers must be processing conditional syntax as an asymmetric constraint. However, the underlying causal knowledge can be sufficient either to discredit or warrant the inferences. Thus according to the theory of natural logic, readers can draw formal deductions and be convinced of their necessity. This provides further evidence that readers can represent their inferences as hypothetical (N. Campion, 2004)."

Short German sentences consisting of a pronoun and a verb, either correct or containing a morphosyntactic violation, were auditorily presented to 17 German-speaking adults with dyslexia, and 17 matched control participants, while an EEG was recorded. In order to investigate the interaction between low-level phonological processing and morphosyntactic processing, the verbal inflections were manipulated to consist of different levels of acoustic salience. The event-related potential (ERP) results confirm altered morphosyntactic processing in participants with dyslexia, especially when morphosyntactic violations are expressed by both lexical and inflectional changes. Moreover, ERP data on phoneme discrimination and behavioural data on phonemic awareness and verbal short-term memory reveal phonological deficits in dyslexic participants. However, a causal relationship between phonological and morphosyntactic processing was not conclusive, because anomalous morphosyntactic processing in dyslexia is not directly mediated by acoustic salience, rather it correlates with high-level phonological skills and is mediated by lexical cues."

Study 2 involved 2 ASD preschool hyperlexic boys, and a group of 21 typical children of similar word reading ability. In both studies, participants were administered several reading measures as well as measures of cognitive and linguistic abilities that have been associated with variations in typical and dyslexic reading, namely, vocabulary, phonological processes, and rapid naming. Results suggest that ASD hyperlexic reading differs from both typical and ASD non-hyperlexic reading. In particular, they suggest that hyperlexics learn to compute letter-sound relations implicitly, on the basis of statistical learning. Although the hyperlexic children could read nonwords as well as the typical and the ASD non-hyperlexic children, they performed significantly worse than these groups of children on a letter-sound knowledge task. They also performed relatively poorly on a phonological awareness task. It is suggested that hyperlexics’ indifference to language as a meaningful, communicative device may be the key to their exceptionally good and precocious development of word reading ability."

Shortly following the target verb onset, listeners looked at the recipient more (relative to the theme) following DO than PO primes, indicating that the structure of the prime affected listeners' eye gazes on the target scene. Crucially, this priming effect was the same irrespective of whether the postverbal nouns in the prime sentences did (""The monarch will send the painting to the president"") or did not (""The monarch will send the envoy to the president"") differ in animacy, suggesting that PO/DO priming in comprehension occurs because structural properties, rather than animacy features, are being primed when people process the ditransitive target verb."

Using a measurement burst design, the one-week sampling procedure was repeated five and then ten years later. Cross-sectional and growth curve analyses indicate that aging is associated with more positive overall emotional well-being, with greater emotional stability and with more complexity (as evidenced by greater co-occurrence of positive and negative emotions). These findings remained robust after accounting for other variables that may be related to emotional experience (personality, verbal fluency, physical health, and demographic variables). Finally, emotional experience predicted mortality; controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity, individuals who experienced relatively more positive than negative emotions in everyday life were more likely to have survived over a 13 year period. Findings are discussed in the theoretical context of socioemotional selectivity theory."

However, the present studies suggest that the timing of a transgression has a systematic effect on people’s beliefs about its moral acceptability. Because people’s emotional reactions tend to be more extreme for future events than for past events, and because such emotional reactions often guide moral intuitions, judgments of moral behavior may be more extreme in prospect than in retrospect. In 7 studies, participants judged future bad deeds more negatively, and future good deeds more positively, than equivalent behavior in the equidistant past. In addition, participants thought that future unfair actions deserved more punishment than past unfair actions, and were more willing to sacrifice their own financial gain to be treated fairly in the future compared with in the past. These patterns were explained in part by the stronger emotions that were evoked by thoughts of future events than by thoughts of past events. Taken together, the results suggest that permission for actions with ethical connotations may be harder to get than forgiveness for those same actions, and demonstrate a systematic way in which moral judgments of the same action are inconsistent across time."

In addition, this rhythmic prime either matched or mismatched the meter (i.e., stress contrasts) of the sentence. Results: Matching conditions resulted in a greater phonological accuracy of spoken sentences compared to baseline and mismatching conditions. Cochlear implant users were also more sensitive to rhythmic priming than hearing aid users.

Children with a deficit in phonological awareness in kindergarten were found to be five times more likely to have dyslexia in second grade than children without such a deficit. This risk ratio substantially increased with the addition of deficits in both oral language and rapid naming. Whereas children with one or more kindergarten deficits were at heighten risk for dyslexia, some of these children were found to be adequate or better readers. These results are discussed within a multifactorial model of dyslexia that includes both risk and protective factors."

In five studies, using both general population samples online and student samples, we show that speciesism is a measurable, stable construct with high interpersonal differences, that goes along with a cluster of other forms of prejudice, and is able to predict real-world decision-making and behavior. In Study 1 we present the development and empirical validation of a theoretically driven Speciesism Scale, which captures individual differences in speciesist attitudes. In Study 2, we show high test-retest reliability of the scale over a period of four weeks, suggesting that speciesism is stable over time. In Study 3, we present positive correlations between speciesism and prejudicial attitudes such as racism, sexism, homophobia, along with ideological constructs associated with prejudice such as social dominance orientation, system justification, and right-wing authoritarianism. These results suggest that similar mechanisms might underlie both speciesism and other well-researched forms of prejudice. Finally, in Studies 4 and 5, we demonstrate that speciesism is able to predict prosociality towards animals (both in the context of charitable donations and time investment) and behavioral food choices above and beyond existing related constructs. Importantly, our studies show that people morally value individuals of certain species less than others even when beliefs about intelligence and sentience are accounted for. We conclude by discussing the implications of a psychological study of speciesism for the psychology of human-animal relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"

This study relied on qualitative interviews with 49 low-income Latina mothers to examine how parenting practices are used when facing neighborhood poverty and the threat of community violence. Several themes emerged in the interviews regarding mothers' approaches to parenting. First, Latina mothers in our sample relied on three strategies previously identified in the literature: (a) strict monitoring, (b) physical and/or social withdrawal from the neighborhood, and (c) engagement in positive, enriching activities for children. In concert with these strategies, these mothers also emphasized the importance of (d) establishing strong parent-child communication as essential to effective parenting in challenging environments. Furthermore, two overarching, culturally salient parental goals were identified: (a) fostering principles of educacion in their children and (b) maintaining astute parental awareness (estar pendiente) of children's physical as well as emotional states. Our findings illuminated culturally specific meanings that accompany parenting practices for low-income Latina mothers and underscored the importance of adapting culturally sensitive interventions for parents.

In accord with the hypothesis that thought-induced attitude polarization requires the presence of a well-developed knowledge structure, high-consistency subjects evidenced greater polarization than low-consistency subjects only on the relevant topic after writing the relevant essay. Content analyses of subjects' relevant essays yielded additional data confirming Tesser's ideas regarding mediation: High (vs. low) consistency subjects expressed a greater proportion of cognitions that were evaluatively consistent with their prior affect toward the attitude object and a smaller proportion of evaluatively inconsistent and neutral cognitions. Moreover, although high-and low-consistency subjects did not differ in the amount of attitudinally relevant information they possessed or their awareness of inconsistent cognitions, their method of dealing with discrepant information diverged: High-consistency subjects evidenced a greater tendency to assimilate discrepant information by generating refutational thoughts that discredited or minimized the importance of inconsistent information."

The article discusses the impacts of sharing personal narratives on the victims and others in society, the connections between personal and master narratives, and ways in which dialogue that incorporates personal narratives can encourage peace. A theoretical categorization of 4 types of personal narratives of massive social trauma is proposed: narratives of vengeance, victimhood, confusion, and embracing the other. Examples from Israelis and Palestinians that reflect this conceptualization are discussed.

START,START,2116487373,selective attention improves under stress implications for theories of social cognition,2003,"eran chajut, daniel algom",journal of personality and social psychology,1,222,105,"Three influential perspectives of social cognition entail conflicting predictions regarding the selectivity of performance under stress. According to the attention view, selectivity to the task-relevant attribute improves under stress because of reduced utilization of task-irrelevant attributes. According to the capacity–resource approach, stress depletes attentional resources wherefore selectivity fails for all but chronically accessible information. A third perspective, ironic process theory, similarly holds that selective attention fails under stress but adds that task-irrelevant information is rendered hyperaccessible. The theoretical derivations were tested in a series of experiments using 2 classes of selectivity measures, with special care taken to control for hitherto neglected factors of context. The results showed that the selectivity of attention improved under stress, consistent with the prediction of the attention view. Following instructions, a flight controller monitors solely the altitude of an approaching airplane, ignoring other data such as its speed, direction, or position with respect to other planes. The controller performs the job with his superintendent watching in close proximity. Does he respond to the changes in altitude faster and in a more accurate fashion than he would without the stressful presence of the superintendent? Do changes in the task-irrelevant dimensions of speed and azimuth intrude on his performance with the target dimension of altitude? Are such intrusions more numerous under high stress than under low stress? Daily life is replete with situations where people must respond to selected attributes of stimuli. All too often, performing the tasks is fraught with stress. The question posed in this study therefore concerns the effect of stress on selective attention. Does stress lead to a narrowing of attention to the task-relevant attribute, hence improving selectivity? Alternatively, does stress precipitate the broadening of attention, rendering the person vulnerable to intrusions from irrelevant attributes? Both possibilities have been argued in the literature. In an attempt to resolve this question, we borrowed state-of-the-art tools of gauging selectivity from the cognitive laboratory (MacLeod, 1991; Melara & Algom, 2003). We measured selectivity under conditions of high and low stress for a range of stimulus attributes, eschewing various biases identified in recent cognitive research. To foreshadow the results, we found interference from irrelevant variation to be smaller under high stress than under low stress. Performance under high stress was almost free of intrusions from task-irrelevant dimensions. We concluded that selective attention improves under high stress. Our results carry theoretical as well as practical ramifications. It is difficult to overstate the practical significance of resolving the question of performance under stress. It may signal the difference between erratic and skillful performance, between losing and keeping one’s job, between depression and normal functioning, or, indeed, between demise and survival. Attention under stress has also accrued vivid theoretical interest because three influential theories of social cognition entail conflicting outcomes. In what follows, we review the various perspectives and derive the pertinent hypotheses regarding selectivity under stress. We then perform a triple dissociation of the conflicting hypotheses by means of a diagnostic design. Two classes of rigorous measures serve to assess selectivity. We report three experiments that demonstrate that selective attention shows marked improvement under stress. Our findings have implications for general models of social cognition."

Art students outperformed nonart students on drawing measures and some (but not all) visual-spatial tasks.

These findings are based primarily on age differences in memories and behavioral preferences in response to interpersonal conflicts (e.g., Blanchard-Fields, 1999). Few studies have examined age differences in reported emotions and cognitions as the events unfold, yet there is growing reason to expect that age differences emerge early in the regulatory process. In laboratory experiments, older adults direct their attention away from negative stimuli (Mather & Carstensen, 2003) and recall fewer negative stimuli relative to younger adults (Charles, Mather & Carstensen, 2003), a phenomenon referred to as the “positivity effect” (Carstensen & Mikels, 2005).

Two bilingual psychologists interviewed each participant once in a semi-structured interview, including 6 questions on mental illness disclosure. Conventional content analysis was applied to conceptualize the phenomenon. Results showed that participants voluntarily disclosed to a circle of people composed primarily of family and relatives. The decisions and strategies to disclose depended on participants’ consideration of three critical elements of social relationships. Ganqing, affection associated with relationship-building, ultimately determined who had the privilege to know. Renqing, the moral code of reciprocal kindness, further influenced disclosure decisions and what participants anticipated as responses to disclosure. Lastly, concerns over preserving face (lian), a construct representing personal and familial dignity, oftentimes prohibited disclosure. Additionally, in this tight-knit network involuntary disclosure could happen without participants’ permission or knowledge. Participants commonly suffered from stigma after disclosure.

In 2 studies, we investigated the impact of 2 fundamental strategies--Dominance (the use of force and intimidation to induce fear) and Prestige (the sharing of expertise or know-how to gain respect)--on the attainment of social rank, which we conceptualized as the acquisition of (a) perceived influence over others (Study 1), (b) actual influence over others' behaviors (Study 1), and (c) others' visual attention (Study 2). Study 1 examined the process of hierarchy formation among a group of previously unacquainted individuals, who provided round-robin judgments of each other after completing a group task. Results indicated that the adoption of either a Dominance or Prestige strategy promoted perceptions of greater influence, by both group members and outside observers, and higher levels of actual influence, based on a behavioral measure. These effects were not driven by popularity; in fact, those who adopted a Prestige strategy were viewed as likable, whereas those who adopted a Dominance strategy were not well liked.

Dominant and Prestigious targets each received greater visual attention than targets low on either dimension.

Favored by natural selection, these signals communicate the displayer's capacity and willingness to inflict harm, and increase responders' likelihood of detecting and establishing a rank asymmetry, and thus avoiding costly physical conflicts. Included among this suite of adaptations are vocal changes, which occur in a wide range of nonhuman animals (e.g., chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys) prior to aggression, but have not been systematically examined in humans. The present research tests whether and how humans use vocal pitch modulations to communicate information about their intention to dominate or submit. RESULTS from Study 1 demonstrate that in the context of face-to-face group interactions, individuals spontaneously alter their vocal pitch in a manner consistent with rank signaling. Raising one's pitch early in the course of an interaction predicted lower emergent rank, whereas deepening one's pitch predicted higher emergent rank. RESULTS from Study 2 provide causal evidence that these vocal shifts influence perceptions of rank and formidability.

To investigate its effect on cortical reading networks in children, we performed functional imaging on 34 simultaneous Hindi–English biliterate children as they read word and nonword stimuli. In contrast to Hindi which is consistent and relies on phonological assembly for both stimuli, English is inconsistent which necessitates lexical retrieval for words, but phonological assembly for nonwords. While children recruited a shared reading network for both languages, factorial analysis revealed stimulus effects (word/nonword) in bilateral frontal, parietal and left angular regions.

We obtained structural imaging data from 30 Hindi–English children aged between 8 and 10 years and used voxel based morphometry to explore neuroanatomical correlates of behavioural measures of phonological awareness. Our results showed that phonological skills in English are predicted by grey matter volume of bilateral putamen, but solely by right putamen in Hindi. Post-hoc analysis revealed that English nonword reading correlates with grey matter volume in bilateral putamen while in Hindi nonword reading it correlates only with right putamen. These differences in putamen-based mechanisms indicate that syllable level awareness sufficiently supports early literacy in the transparent, alphasyllabic Hindi orthography whereas that in English requires both phonemic and syllabic level awareness. Our findings point towards a key role for putamen in mediating phonological and reading skills in children."

However, people tend to vary in their level of emotional expression. This meta-analysis investigated the relationships between levels of emotion expression and suppression, and social and interpersonal outcomes. PsycINFO databases, as well as reference lists were searched. Forty-three papers from a total of 3,200 papers met inclusion criteria, allowing for 105 effect sizes to be calculated. Meta-analyses revealed that greater suppression of emotion was significantly associated with poorer social wellbeing, including more negative first impressions, lower social support, lower social satisfaction and quality, and poorer romantic relationship quality. Furthermore, the expression of positive and general/nonspecific emotion was related to better social outcomes, while the expression of anger was associated with poorer social wellbeing. Expression of negative emotion generally was also associated with poorer social outcomes, although this effect size was very small and consisted of mixed results. These findings highlight the importance of considering the role that regulation of emotional expression can play in the development of social dysfunction and interpersonal problems.

Gender differences in interest in computer science, engineering, and physics appear even before college. Why are women represented in some science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields more than others? We conduct a critical review of the most commonly cited factors explaining gender disparities in STEM participation and investigate whether these factors explain differential gender participation across STEM fields. Math performance and discrimination influence who enters STEM, but there is little evidence to date that these factors explain why women's underrepresentation is relatively worse in some STEM fields. We introduce a model with three overarching factors to explain the larger gender gaps in participation in computer science, engineering, and physics than in biology, chemistry, and mathematics: (a) masculine cultures that signal a lower sense of belonging to women than men, (b) a lack of sufficient early experience with computer science, engineering, and physics, and (c) gender gaps in self-efficacy. Efforts to increase women's participation in computer science, engineering, and physics may benefit from changing masculine cultures and providing students with early experiences that signal equally to both girls and boys that they belong and can succeed in these fields.

Hence, the influence of NFC should be shaped by chronically accessible knowledge structures in a culture, and, likewise, the influence of culture should be moderated by epistemic motives such as NFC. The specific hypotheses drew on past findings that North American and Chinese attributors possess differing implicit social theories, North Americans conceiving of individuals as autonomous agents and Chinese conceiving of groups as autonomous. The present studies found the predicted pattern that among North American participants, NFC increased attributions to personal but not group dispositions. Among Chinese participants, NFC increased attributions to group but not personal dispositions. The findings are discussed in light of an emerging dynamic account of culture and cognition. Cross-cultural research on dispositionist social thinking has found that the bias toward personal dispositions long observed by researchers working in Western individualistic cultures is less prevalent among participants in East Asian cultures (Morris & Peng, 1994). In East Asian cultures influenced by Confucianism, participants show a different bias, one toward unwarranted inferences about group dispositions rather than individual dispositions (Menon, Morris, Chiu, & Hong, 1999). These findings, along with other evidence, suggest that American and Chinese cultures impart differing implicit social theories, the American theory emphasizing individual autonomy and the Chinese theory emphasizing the autonomy of social collectives (Hong, Morris, Chiu, & BenetMartinez, in press; Suet al., 1999)."

START,START,1992172722,coordination of word recognition and oculomotor control during reading the role of implicit lexical decisions,2013,"wonil choi, peter c gordon",journal of experimental psychology human perception and performance,1,15,72,"Recognizing words so that their meanings can be retrieved is critical to successful reading comprehension. These lexical processes must be coordinated with other perceptual, motor, and attentive processes in order for eye movements during reading to be controlled efficiently. During reading the eyes alternate between fixations (periods when the eyes are nearly stationary) and saccades (rapid ballistic movements); for skilled readers saccades typically occur four to five times per second with most words receiving only a single first-pass fixation (Rayner, 1998). Oculomotor processes, which are constrained by differential acuity across the retina and by the nature of ocular motor control, are major determinants of eye movements during reading. The contribution of these processes can be seen in how physical characteristics of text, such as the length of words, influence the pattern of fixations and saccades. Language-based processes that relate to comprehension of the text also exert a strong influence on when – and occasionally where – the eyes move during reading. The contribution of these processes can be seen in how eye movements are influenced by non-physical aspects of the text such as word frequency or the predictability of a word in context. Very different explanations have been advanced for how oculomotor and language-based processes are coordinated. At one extreme it is argued that language-based effects on eye-movements lead to only slight modulation of a more basic oculomotor process that generates forward saccades of a standard length at a regular rhythm (McConkie, Kerr, Reddix, & Zola, 1988; O’Regan, 1990; Yang & McConkie, 2001). At the other extreme it is argued that, while oculomotor processes determine most characteristics of the targeting of forward saccades, word recognition determines when saccades are initiated and in some instances their targeting (Morrison, 1984; Pollatsek, Reichle & Rayner, 2006; Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998). Other models take more intermediate positions (Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, & Kliegl, 2005; Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003).

The phenomenon of skipping, where a word is not directly fixated during the first pass of the eyes over the text, has been central to the evaluation of these alternative models. Word length has a very strong effect on skipping, with short words skipped more frequently than long words (Kerr, 1992; Vitu, O’Regan, Inhoff, & Topolski, 1995; for a review see Brysbaert, Drieghe, & Vitu, 2005). This effect can be readily understood as resulting from visual and motor processes. A short word to the right of the fixated word is seen more clearly than a long word because it is more likely to fit within the fovea. Further, having the eyes land on short words tends to require shorter saccades than having them land on long words, which increases the likelihood that short words will be skipped because motor error in saccade targeting takes the form of overshoot for short saccades and undershoot for long saccades (McConkie, Kerr, & Dyre, 1994; McConkie et al., 1988). Language-based factors also affect skipping, such that frequent and predictable words are more likely to be skipped than infrequent or unpredictable words (Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Rayner & Fisher, 1996; Rayner & Raney, 1996; Rayner & Well, 1996; Schilling, Rayner, & Chumbley, 1998; White, 2008). Skipping effects are interesting in part because they are the only case where language factors related to word recognition affect the targeting of forward saccades rather than just their timing (Drieghe, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2005). As such, skipping has been an important arena for addressing the manner in which lexical processing is coordinated with processes of attention, vision and motor control during reading.

Models of eye movement control that attribute only a small role to language-based processing relative to oculomotor processing account for language effects on skipping in a number of ways. For example, according to the Extended Optimal Viewing Position (EOVP) model, language-based skips are in essence an educated guess based on factors such as word length and very partial word identification (Brysbaert & Vitu, 1998). The main determinants of the decision to skip a word are the length of the word in the parafovea and the experience the system has built up with how often a word of a certain length at a certain distance can be skipped without hindering overall text comprehension. Consequently that decision is made with very limited information about the identity of the skipped word. Models of eye-movement control that attribute a more substantial role to language-based (or cognitive) factors have gone through a number of iterations and refinements, but have retained a core set of mechanisms to account for language-based skipping as described by the EZ Reader model (Morrison, 1984; Pollatsek et al., 2006; Reichle et al., 1998). These models posit a serial-attention-shifting mechanism where words in the text are processed one at a time (though recognition of a word is achieved by matching the stimulus to multiple lexical and sublexical representations in parallel). Once the fixated word is recognized, attention shifts to processing parafoveal information about the next word. Attention shifts prior to movement of the eyes because of limits on the rate at which saccades can be generated. In the majority of cases the oculomotor system then executes a planned saccade which has been targeted to the next word on the basis of a parallel process of visual analysis that locates word boundaries. The processing that occurs prior to fixation on that word provides a parafoveal-preview benefit that facilitates recognition, a spillover effect that can be observed in first-pass reading times (Henderson & Ferreira, 1990; Kennison & Clifton, 1995; White, Rayner, & Liversedge, 2005). In a minority of cases, recognition of the word in the parafovea occurs quickly enough that the planned saccade to that word can be cancelled and a new saccade can be programmed to a more distant word resulting in a skip of the word in the parafovea. Thus, according to the EZ Reader model the ease of recognizing the current word affects both the amount of parafoveal-preview benefit on the next word and, together with the ease of recognizing the next word, determines whether that next word is skipped. A strong association between ease of word recognition, parafoveal preview benefit and skipping has been found for word frequency and predictability (e.g., Drieghe et al. 2005; Rayner & Fisher, 1996) though manipulations of the visual characteristics of text (Drieghe, 2008) and the phonological length of words (Fitzsimmons & Drieghe, 2011) have shown dissociations between these factors.

An essential feature of the serial-attention-shifting models is that the same mechanisms are used for recognizing words in the fovea and parafovea. In both cases the initiation of saccadic processes is linked to processing words to a level where the words are highly likely to be fully recognized soon (Pollatsek et al., 2006). Gordon, Plummer and Choi (in press) tested this model by using repetition to manipulate the ease of recognizing a target word while using the boundary technique (Rayner, 1975) to manipulate the information about that word available during parafoveal preview. The boundary technique is a gaze-contingent method where the stimulus word changes when the eyes cross an invisible boundary on the screen, thereby allowing manipulation of the relationship between parafoveal and foveal information about a word. In Gordon et al. the string in the parafovea could either be the target word itself (e.g., the name Herman) or a nonword created by transposing two internal letters of the target word (e.g., Hreman). When used as primes in masked-priming studies or as preview strings in eye-movement studies, such transposed letter (TL) nonwords produce substantial facilitation in the subsequent processing of the target word as compared to substituted letter (SL) nonwords that have the same number of letter-in-position differences with the target word (Johnson, Perea, & Rayner, 2007; Perea & Lupker, 2003a, 2003b;). However, when TL nonwords are directly fixated they disrupt reading (causing longer first-pass reading times and greater likelihood of refixation) because they are not words (Rayner, White, Johnson, & Liversedge, 2006; White, Johnson, Liversedge, & Rayner, 2008). Gordon et al. found that facilitating lexical access through repetition increased skipping when the parafoveal preview string was the target word itself, but that repetition had no effect on skipping when the parafoveal preview string was a highly-similar TL nonword. This pattern supports serial-attention-shifting models, such as EZ Reader, by showing that the letter string in the parafovea must be recognized as a word in order for lexical priming to increase skipping above the baseline rate that occurs due to oculomotor processes. Thus, it is not the case that contextual facilitation due to repetition priming constitutes a bias that combines with partial visual information from the periphery to increase skipping (see Engbert et al., 2005; Rayner, Slattery, Drieghe & Liversedge, 2011 for advocacy of such a mechanism in the case of word predictability). The Gordon et al. findings are consistent with models of eye-movement control during reading where the key link between language-based and oculomotor processes is an implicit lexical decision about whether the letter string in the parafovea will be successfully recognized as a word."

When these two principles conflict with one another, people will often waste resources to avoid inequity. We suggest that people wish to avoid inequity not because they find it inherently unfair, but because they want to avoid the appearance of partiality associated with it. We explore one way to reduce waste by reducing the perceived partiality of inequitable allocations. Specifically, we hypothesize that people will be more likely to favor an efficient (albeit inequitable) allocation if it puts them in a disadvantaged position than if it puts others in a disadvantaged position. To test this hypothesis, we asked participants to choose between giving some extra resource to one person (thereby creating inequity between this person and equally deserving others) and not giving the resource to anyone (thereby wasting the resource). Six studies, using realistic scenarios and behavioral paradigms, provide robust evidence for a self-disadvantaging effect: Allocators were consistently more likely to create inequity to avoid wasting resources when the resulting inequity would put them at a relative disadvantage than when it would put others at a relative disadvantage. We further find that this self-disadvantaging effect is a direct result of people's concern about appearing partial. Our findings suggest the importance of impartiality even in distributive justice, thereby bridging a gap between the distributive and procedural justice literatures.

Across eight studies, we found that (a) the features that participants attributed to the true self resembled the features typically attributed to essences (e.g., immutability, informativeness, inherence; Studies 1–4); (b) endorsement of belief in true selves correlated with endorsement of other essentialist beliefs (Study 5); and (c) experimental manipulations of essentialist beliefs in domains other than the self spilled over and affected participants’ endorsement of belief in true selves (Studies 6–8). These findings advance theory on the origins and functions of beliefs about the true self, suggesting that these beliefs are, in part, a specific downstream consequence of the broader tendency to explain phenomena in the world in terms of underlying essences.

START,START,1806210563,the meaning of social support for persons with serious mental illness,2015,"julie chronister, chihchin chou, kwong liem karl kwan, melissa lawton, kurt silver",rehabilitation psychology,1,11,11,"“Serious mental illness” (SMI) is defined by federal regulations as any diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder experienced by persons age 18 and older that is characterized by episodic, recurrent or persistent features and substantially interferes with or limits the ability to participate in one or more major life activities (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1992). Five percent of the U.S. population experiences SMI and it is a leading cause of disability (National Institute of Mental Health, 2014). The SMI population experiences significant stressors such as illness management, isolation, homelessness and stigma – long understood to be barriers to functioning and societal participation – which elevate the risk of morbidity and mortality (Madianos, 2010; Narrow, Regier, Norquist et al., 2000). In fact, the life expectancy of persons with SMI is an alarmingly 25-30 years less than that of the general population (Colton & Manderscheid, 2006). Studies showing that these stressors cannot be alleviated solely through psychopharmacological and/or behavioral interventions have led to recommendations that psychosocial approaches such as social support interventions be added to the SMI treatment toolkit (Corrigan & Phelan, 2004; Madianos, 2010; Narrow et al., 2000; Whitley, Harris, Fallot, & Berley, 2008).

Social support has been demonstrated to buffer the negative impact of stress among the general population (Cohen, 2001; Cohen, Doyle, Turner, Alper & Skoner, 2003; Feldman, Cohen, Hamrick & Lepore, 2004) and has achieved national attention as a key component of the mental health recovery paradigm for persons with SMI defined as “a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential” (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011). Specifically, Community, or the relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope is identified as a major dimension of the recovery model, and three out of the ten major principles guiding the recovery model address social support in some way. For example, recovery is described to include support from peers and allies, through relationships and social networks, and involving individuals, family, community strengths and weaknesses (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2014). In addition, clinical practice guidelines for healthcare settings now include social support assessment as an essential part of psychiatric evaluation (Lehman & Steinwachs, 2010).

To date, little is known about how social support buffers the negative impact of stress among those with SMI. The limited body of research that exists suggests that social support is positively linked to quality of life (Bengtsson-Tops & Hansson, 2001; Sharir, Tanasescu, Turbow & Mamam, 2007), yet, the findings in aggregate reveal small to moderate effect sizes, and some studies show no effect (Anonymous & Anonymous, 2012). We believe these mixed findings are due, in part, to the use of non-population specific measures that do not capture the unique types of support relevant for persons with SMI. These studies are based on measures of social support designed for the general population who experience “typical” life stressors (e.g., divorce, death, loss of job), whereas the SMI population experiences an additional distinctive set of chronic and often debilitating stressors related to stigma, isolation, homelessness and illness management (Madianos, 2010; Narrow et al., 2000). Moreover, researchers who investigate social support with distinct clinical populations point out that general population measures are not sufficient in and of themselves (Broadhead & Kaplan, 1991; Wortman, 1984) and that population-specific support measures are necessary in order to help interpret the existing “morass of positive and negative studies [which are] of little value in the aggregate” (Broadhead & Kaplan, p.67).

Recently-developed measures of social support for individuals with diabetes, cancer, and other specific health conditions have made important contributions in this area (e.g., McCormack, Williams-Piehota, Bann, Burton, Kamerow et al., 2008; Taskila, Lindbohm, Martikainen, Lehto, Hakanen et al., 2006; Yanover & Sacco, 2008). For example, the diabetes-specific support scale Resources and Support for Self-Management (McCormack et al., 2008) measures five domains of functional support unique to persons with diabetes and has been found to be both psychometrically sound and clinically useful. A limited number of studies have explored SMI-specific types of social support. Breier and Strauss (1984) conducted a qualitative study that identified SMI types of supports such as symptom monitoring, role modeling and reality testing. In addition, Walsh and Connelly (1996) observed that emotional support was more common than material and instrumental support among this population. To date, research paralleling the scientific advancement made with other clinical populations has not occurred with the SMI population; indeed, the types of social support relevant to persons with SMI differ from those of the general population and requires systematic investigation. Therefore, this study sought to better understand the population-specific types of social support relevant to adults living with SMI.

Our study was exploratory and used a qualitative approach that centered on uncovering the types of social support meaningful and relevant to persons with SMI. Despite the phenomenological nature of our inquiry, the premise of our study was based on a broad conceptualization of social support defined as the emotional and tangible provisions by others that are perceived to be helpful by the receiver (Cohen & Syme, 1985). Our investigation was also guided by two overarching typologies of social support that have been consistently identified as the most salient and encompassing types of support: emotional support and instrumental support (Declercq, Vanheule, Markey & Willemsen, 2007; Shakespeare-Finch & Obst, 2011). Emotional support involves the provision of caring, empathy, love and trust (House, 1981; Krause, 1986), an affective transaction which imparts liking, admiration, respect and love (Kahn & Antonucci, 1980), or support that leads to the information that one is cared for and loved, is esteemed and valued, and belongs to a network of mutual obligation (Cobb, 1976). Instrumental support is the provision of tangible goods, aid, services, or concrete assistance that is intended to solve a problem or accomplish a task (Barrera, 1986; Cohen & McKay, 1984; Cutrona & Russell, 1990; Krause, 1986; Langford, Bowsher, Maloney, & Lillis, 1997)."

We examined these relations in a group of 152 children attending grade 1 in a French immersion program. Measures of English and French lexical orthographic processing (e.g., dream-dreem; jaune-jeaune) as well as English and French spelling were administered. Control measures included nonverbal ability, English phonological awareness, as well as rapid automatised naming, vocabulary, and word reading in English and French. We found a within-language relation between orthographic processing and spelling in each of English and French. Cross-language transfer from French orthographic processing to English spelling was also observed; there were no relations in the other direction. Our results suggest that orthographic processing is important for spelling development among bilingual children learning English and French.


What is already known about this topic:

Orthographic processing plays an important role in monolingual children's word reading and spelling
Orthographic processing in one language is significantly related to word reading in the other language in bilingual children who are acquiring languages that share the same script
The extent to which orthographic processing is related to spelling is not clear in bilingual children


What this paper adds:

Orthographic processing contributes to spelling within English and French in a novel group of bilingual children in French immersion
Orthographic processing in French transfers to spelling in English
The direction of cross-language transfer of orthographic processing to spelling occurs from the more consistent orthography to the less consistent one


Implications for theory, policy, or practice:

Cross-language transfer of orthographic processing may be due to shared orthographic structures and common underlying processes involved in extracting orthographic information in English and French
The educational context in which second language is acquired may play an important role in spelling development in both English and French
French immersion educators should highlight similarities in orthographic conventions in English and French during literacy instruction to facilitate spelling development"

In this study, a sample of 11 veterans and family members were assessed for PTSD and other conditions. Evaluations were made using the SA-45 (Symptom Assessment 45) and the PCL-M (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist—Military) using a time-series, within-subjects, repeated measures design. A baseline measurement was obtained 30 days prior to treatment and immediately before treatment. Participants were then treated with a brief and novel exposure therapy, EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques), for 5 days. Statistically significant improvements in the SA-45 and PCL-M scores were found at posttest. These gains were maintained at both the 30- and 90-day follow-ups on the general symptom index, positive symptom total, and the anxiety, somatization, phobic anxiety, and interpersonal sensitivity subscales of the SA-45, and on PTSD. The remaining SA-45 scales improved posttest but were not consistently maintained at the 30-and 90-day follow-ups. One-year follow-up data were obtained for 7 of the participants and the same improvements were observed. In summary, after EFT treatment, the group no longer scored positive for PTSD, the severity and breadth of their psychological distress decreased significantly, and most of their gains held over time. This suggests that EFT can be an effective postdeployment intervention."

Although there are well-validated phenomenological interviews for assessing ASEs, there are no self-report measures. The current research describes 4 studies designed to develop and validate a new scale to assess ASEs: the Inventory of Psychotic-Like Anomalous Self-Experiences (IPASE). In Study 1, an overinclusive item pool was generated based on phenomenological descriptions of ASEs, and items were kept or discarded based on factor loadings in an exploratory factor analysis. Five factors were extracted including disturbances in Cognition, Consciousness, Self-Awareness and Presence, Somatization, and Transitivism/Demarcation. The 5-factor structure was confirmed in Study 2, and the scale showed measurement invariance between sexes. IPASE scores were correlated with self-report and task measures of self-processing including self-concept clarity, self-consciousness, and self-esteem as well as measures of psychotic-like experiences.

However, the literature on social norms and health in LMIC is still scarce. A well-known application of social norm theory in LMIC involves abandonment of female genital cutting (FGC) in West Africa. We argue that FGC is a special case because of its unique relationship between the norm and the practice; health promotion interventions would benefit from a wider understanding of how social norms can influence different types of health-related behaviors. We hypothesize that four factors shape the strength of a norm over a practice: (1) whether the practice is dependent or interdependent; (2) whether it is more or less detectable; (3) whether it is under the influence of distal or proximal norms; and (4) whether noncompliance is likely to result in sanctions. We look at each of these four factors in detail, and suggest that different relations between norms and a practice might require different programmatic solutions. Future findings that will confirm or contradict our hypothesis will be critical for effective health promotion interventions that aim to change harmful social norms in LMIC.

Across 5 studies using experimental, survey, and archival data and multiple measures of free will belief, we tested the hypothesis that a key factor promoting belief in free will is a fundamental desire to hold others morally responsible for their wrongful behaviors. In Study 1, participants reported greater belief in free will after considering an immoral action than a morally neutral one. Study 2 provided evidence that this effect was due to heightened punitive motivations. In a field experiment (Study 3), an ostensibly real classroom cheating incident led to increased free will beliefs, again due to heightened punitive motivations. In Study 4, reading about others’ immoral behaviors reduced the perceived merit of anti-free-will research, thus demonstrating the effect with an indirect measure of free will belief. Finally, Study 5 examined this relationship outside the laboratory and found that the real-world prevalence of immoral behavior (as measured by crime and homicide rates) predicted free will belief on a country level. Taken together, these results provide a potential explanation for the strength and prevalence of belief in free will: It is functional for holding others morally responsible and facilitates justifiably punishing harmful members of society."

Response timing analysis of different components of RAN digits and letters revealed that neither average item duration nor average pause duration were unique predictors of reading skill. However, the number of pauses on digit naming predicted unique variance in exception word reading. Moreover, better readers paused more strategically than poorer readers (e.g. more often at the ends of lines).

One implication of this is that exclusion may foster judgments of others that are reliant on a careful consideration of their idiosyncratic behaviors rather than on more superficial features. We predicted, therefore, that excluded individuals should individuate more and stereotype less than non-excluded individuals and that such effects should be in service of identifying appropriate re-affiliation candidates. In 3 replications of Experiment 1, excluded (compared to non-excluded) individuals rendered less stereotypic judgments of occupational and racial group members described with mildly or ambiguously counter-stereotypic information. Confirming such processes aid with re-affiliation, Experiments 2 and 3 showed that these effects occurred for social targets that represented reasonable sources of re-affiliation, but not for offensive social targets (i.e., Skinheads) or non-social agents. Experiment 4 underscored that excluded participants process presented social information more carefully (individuate), showing greater differentiation in judgments of highly stereotype-consistent and stereotype-inconsistent targets.

Electrophysiological measures were composed of the amplitude of the N400 component of the event-related potential waveform elicited by real words, pseudowords, nonpronounceable letter strings, and strings of letter-like symbols (false fonts). The only significant brain-behavior correlations were between standard scores on the vocabulary test and N400 mean amplitude to real words (r = −.272) and pseudowords (r = −.235). We conclude that, while these specific sets of standardized behavioral and electrophysiological measures both provide an index of reading, for the most part, they are independent and draw upon different underlying processing resources.

Reading is a complex task that involves numerous kinds of skills and knowledge, as well as numerous neural networks (e.g., Adams, 1990; Dehaene, 2009). There is relatively strong behavioral evidence indicating that knowledge about print and orthographic awareness (e.g., Perfetti & Bolger, 2004; Treiman, 2000), knowledge of phonemes and phonological awareness (e.g., Bryant, MacLean, & Bradley, 1990; Shaywitz, 1996), knowledge concerning word meanings and vocabulary (e.g., Carlisle, 2000; Nagy & Townsend, 2012), and comprehension skills (e.g., Hulme & Snowling, 2011; Willingham, 2006–2007), amongst others, are integral to reading development and achievement. However, there is less evidence concerning how behavioral measures of these elements of reading may be correlated with electrophysiological measures of reading. From the perspective of Mind, Brain, and Education, with its emphasis on multiple levels of analysis (e.g., Ansari & Coch, 2006), exploring such brain-behavior relationships will be key in unraveling the story of reading development. In this study, we investigated whether and how standardized measures of orthographic and phonological knowledge, vocabulary, and comprehension were related to the amplitude of the N400 component of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform in a group of typically developing, late elementary school children.

ERPs are a derivative of the electroencephalogram, and are time-locked to presentations of stimuli. The ERP waveform represents the averaged response to multiple presentations of a specific stimulus type and is characterized by a series of positive and negative deflections. These peaks and valleys in the waveform are typically labeled with a P (positive-going deflection) or an N (negative-going deflection) and a number indicating the time in milliseconds that the peak or valley maximally occurs after presentation of the stimulus. Each of the deflections in the ERP waveform is associated with different kinds of processing (e.g., Luck, 2005). The N400 component, a negative deflection in the waveform peaking at about 400 ms after stimulus presentation, was originally identified in sentence processing studies in conditions of semantic ambiguity or novelty. For example, the anomalous terminal word socks in the sentence He spread the warm bread with socks elicited a marked N400 in comparison to the canonical terminal word butter (Kutas & Hillyard, 1980). Since then, the N400 has consistently been associated with lexical and semantic processing in studies with adults (for reviews, see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Lau, Phillips, & Poeppel, 2008).

Comparatively few studies of reading with children have used the N400 to investigate the typical course of lexicosemantic development (e.g., Benau, Morris, & Couperus, 2011; Coch, Maron, Wolf, & Holcomb, 2002; Eddy, Grainger, Holcomb, Mitra, & Gabrieli, 2014; Holcomb, Coffey, & Neville, 1992). Those that have done so have suggested developmental changes in the component. For example, Holcomb and colleagues (1992) presented visual sentences with canonical or anomalous terminal words to 7- to 26-year-olds and found that anomalous words elicited larger N400s than canonical terminal words in all the age groups. However, canonical terminal words also elicited substantial N400s, only in the youngest children (age groups 7–8 and 9–10). Similarly, in a study with 10- and 11-year-olds presenting single stimuli in list form, Coch et al. (2002) found that real words, pseudowords, nonpronounceable letter strings, and strings of letter-like symbols (false fonts) all elicited marked N400s. This contrasts with data from adults in which the N400 is much larger to potentially meaningful strings, such as words and pseudowords, than to meaningless strings, such as random sequences of letters (e.g., Bentin, Mouchetant-Rostaing, Giard, Echallier, & Pernier, 1999; Nobre & McCarthy, 1994).

A number of studies have used the N400 to investigate lexicosemantic development, in combination with behavioral measures, but without using an ERP reading paradigm. For example, there have been interesting investigations of N400 effects in infants for spoken words paired with pictures (e.g., Friedrich & Friederici, 2005); changes in phonological representations (N400 measured to spoken words) over the course of early reading acquisition (e.g., Bonte & Blomert, 2004); relationships between the N400 elicited by picture and spoken word pairs and vocabulary knowledge in both typically developing and special populations (e.g., Byrne et al., 1999; Byrne, Dywan, & Connolly, 1995a; Byrne, Dywan, & Connolly, 1995b; McCleery et al., 2010; Molfese & Morris, 1990); and relationships between the size of the N400 elicited by pairs of pictures and spoken words and scores on tests of listening comprehension, nonword decoding, and word reading in 8- to 10-year-olds (children with better reading and decoding skills showed smaller amplitude N400s, Henderson, Baseler, Clarke, Watson, & Snowling, 2011). However, these studies are limited in that they did not record ERPs to actual written word stimuli.

ERP studies using both standardized measures of reading and some sort of reading paradigm to elicit the N400 with typically developing children are scarce. In one, using a variant of the Reicher-Wheeler paradigm (e.g., Reicher, 1969; Wheeler, 1970) with 24 7- and 24 11-year-olds, the authors reported a moderate correlation (r = −.418) between the average peak amplitude of the N400 and standard scores on the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests - Revised Word Identification subtest (Coch, Mitra, & George, 2012). In another, a composite score based on Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests - Revised Letter Identification, Word Identification, and Word Attack subtest scores was strongly correlated (r = −.65) with N400 amplitude averaged across known words, unknown words, and difficult words in a group of 14 first-grade girls, suggesting a “relatively robust relation between N400 amplitude and reading ability” in beginning readers (Coch & Holcomb, 2003, p. 160). However, these studies were small and spanned across early and late elementary school.

Studies of struggling readers that have included typically developing control groups, standardized behavioral measures, and an ERP reading task may also speak to the potential relationship between electrophysiological and standardized behavioral measures of reading. For example, Hasko, Groth, Bruder, Bartling, and Schulte-Korne (2013) recently reported a study in which 8-year-old children (29 controls and 52 with developmental dyslexia) were asked to judge whether singly presented written words, pseudohomophones, pseudowords, and false fonts sounded like a real German word or not. The mean peak amplitude of the N400, calculated across the three letter string conditions (i.e., excluding false fonts), was correlated with spelling scores (r = −.25), such that better spelling was related to larger N400 amplitude, regardless of diagnosis. Thus, there is some suggestion in the literature, across both typically and atypically developing populations, that N400 ERP amplitude to written strings and various standardized behavioral measures of reading and spelling are correlated.

Here, we built on these scattered reports and directly analyzed brain-behavior relationships in a group of 72 typically developing late elementary school students. We used the N400 elicited by single real words, pseudowords, nonpronounceable letter strings, and strings of false font characters as our electrophysiological measures (Coch, 2015) and scores on standardized tests of spelling, phonological processing, vocabulary, comprehension, naming speed, and memory as our behavioral measures. Based on the scant developmental literature, we hypothesized that the amplitude of the N400 to real words would be associated with behavioral semantic measures, such as measures of vocabulary and, perhaps, comprehension (e.g., Holcomb et al., 1992), and our measure of spelling (e.g., Hasko et al., 2013). Others have noted a “general need in this field to combine behavioural and neurological techniques to enable a better understanding of whether we are measuring the same underlying processes with each methodology” (Henderson et al., 2011, p. 90). This is the overarching question addressed in the current study."

In 2 experiments, no overall memory benefit was observed for license plates with symbols compared to standard designs. Although symbols conveyed no memory advantage, we show that, under certain conditions, including symbols can reduce the number of matching plates when a plate is partially remembered, enhancing the ability of investigators to identify the specific vehicle involved in a crime. We also assessed recall performance for license plates viewed under a range of conditions. Exposure time and the time delay to report have both real-world relevance and clearly predicted effects grounded in the basic memory literature. Memory increased with exposure time, but there was no effect of study-test delay. We also manipulated viewing orientation to allow comparison of memory given a standard view with the mirror-reversed view that a witness might experience while driving. Memory was significantly worse for mirror-reversed plates."

Those developmental changes in the relationship between RAN and reading have so far been explained in term of participants’ age. However, it should be noted that in the previous experiments age always co-vary with participants reading level. It is thus not clear whether RAN-reading relationship is developmental in nature or related to the reading system itself. This study investigates whether the behavioral changes in the relationship between RAN and reading and their electrophysiological correlates are related to the chronological age or to the reading level of the participants. 32 French-speaking children aged 7 to 10 years took part to the experiment: they were divided into groups contrasted on age but with similar reading levels and the other way round. Participants performed two reading tasks and four RAN tasks. EEG/ERP was recorded during discrete letter and picture RAN. Behavioral results revealed that alphanumeric RAN is more sensitive to age variations than reading level differences. The inverse profile was revealed for picture RAN, which discriminate poor and good readers among typically developed children within the same age-group. ERPs of both letter and picture RAN differed across age groups whereas only for the picture RAN ERPs differed across reading levels. Taken together, these results suggest that picture RAN is a particularly good indicator of reading level variance independently of age."

Fall reading, vocabulary, and writing data were collected from 391 students, and classroom writing instruction and student writing practice were observed in 50 classrooms. The effects of writing instruction on spring reading achievement were evaluated using a 2-level, fixed effects structural equation model. In a multiple mediator model, the total indirect effect of composing writing instruction through student writing practice on spring reading achievement was positive and statistically significant (β = .17, p = .029), with a modest effect of composing writing instruction mediated by generative writing practice (β = .15, p = .024). The final model explained 86% and 59% of the variability in spring reading achievement at the student and classroom levels, respectively. These results suggest that generative writing practice mediates the relationship between composing instruction and spring reading achievement.

We propose activities that are engaging, arousing, and associated with the mental state of flow can be particularly helpful and inspire what we call rejuvenation. Rejuvenation, as we conceive it, is a state of feeling restored, renewed, and ready to start anew, which continues beyond immediate participation in a mood-repair activity. To explore this model, we examined rejuvenation in a sample of 435 women, all experienced in some form of textile handcrafts. Consistent with our model, we found that textile-handcraft activities rated as rejuvenating (i.e., mixed media, surface design, quilting, weaving, spinning, and dyeing) were also rated as arousing and engaging. In fact, higher levels of arousal and higher levels of engagement were associated with higher levels of rejuvenation (hereafter termedtextile rejuvenation). Adapting Waterman et al.’s (2003) Personally Expressive Activities Questionnaire (PEAQ), we asked each participant to specify the 1 activity she considered to be most important to her self-definition. Based on the nature of their most self-defining or PEAQ activity, we then categorized participants as anart makeror anonart maker. Compared to nonart makers, women categorized as art makers (69%) reported greater rejuvenation (hereafter termedPEAQ rejuvenation), flow, personal expressiveness, self-realization of values, and skill and challenge during art-making. For the art-maker group, mood repair during an activity, flow, and self-realization of values predicted PEAQ rejuvenation. These outcomes could not be explained by indicators of well being, age, income, or education. A state of rejuvenation, it seems, may linger after participation in (a) textilehandcraft activities that are arousing and engaging, and (b) PEAQ activities that are high in mood repair, flow, and self-realization of values."

Understanding how they interact requires studying how cognitive control facilitates learning, but also how learning provides the (potentially hidden) structure, such as abstract rules or task-sets, needed for cognitive control. We investigate this question from three complementary angles. First, we develop a new computational “C-TS” (context-task-set) model inspired by non-parametric Bayesian methods, specifying how the learner might infer hidden structure and decide whether to re-use that structure in new situations, or to create new structure. Second, we develop a neurobiologically explicit model to assess potential mechanisms of such interactive structured learning in multiple circuits linking frontal cortex and basal ganglia. We systematically explore the link betweens these levels of modeling across multiple task demands. We find that the network provides an approximate implementation of high level C-TS computations, where manipulations of specific neural mechanisms are well captured by variations in distinct C-TS parameters. Third, this synergism across models yields strong predictions about the nature of human optimal and suboptimal choices and response times during learning. In particular, the models suggest that participants spontaneously build task-set structure into a learning problem when not cued to do so, which predicts positive and negative transfer in subsequent generalization tests. We provide evidence for these predictions in two experiments and show that the C-TS model provides a good quantitative fit to human sequences of choices in this task. These findings implicate a strong tendency to interactively engage cognitive control and learning, resulting in structured abstract representations that afford generalization opportunities, and thus potentially long-term rather than short-term optimality."

Whilst a number of studies support the relationship between the development of reading fluency and subsequent improvements in reading comprehension, many studies have shown faster and more accurate decoding does not automatically lead to better comprehension. Often overlooked is the role of the text representation that is encoded in memory during reading and its influence on skilled reading comprehension. In this article, the authors review literature that explores the relationship between text representation and fluent reading. Based upon the results of this review, the authors suggest that the type of representation formed during reading is closely related to the development of both skilled reading comprehension and fluent reading. Keywords: fluency, text representation, repetition fact, reading comprehension The development of a skilled reader is a remarkable process. Over a relatively short period of time, a reader progresses from labourious word-by-word decoding to quickly and accurately understanding and constructing meaning contained in sentences, paragraphs, and entire passages. There has been considerable research on a number of predictors related to the development of reading comprehension, including phonological awareness, naming speed, and orthographic knowledge. However, the role of the text representation that is encoded in memory during reading and its influence on skilled reading comprehension is often overlooked. In this paper, we make the suggestion that the type of representation formed during reading seems to be closely related to the development of not only skilled reading comprehension, but also the development of reading fluency. To illustrate the relationship between text representation, comprehension and fluency, we start by reviewing literature concerning the kind of text representation laid down in memory. Following this, we explore the relationship between text representation and fluent text processing by outlining a recent model of text representation that can explain seemingly contradictory results. Finally, we review several studies that illustrate that the type of text representation influences both reading fluency and skilled reading comprehension. To understand ideas regarding the nature of text representation, one must first understand the text repetition task, which is the procedure used to investigate the nature of text representation. Individuals read a passage and then read a version of that passage again. The measure of interest is known as the repetition effect/ benefit or transfer and is the difference in reading time between the first and second reading. Researchers have consistently found that readers of all ability levels display a repetition effect when reading the same text a second time (see Levy, 1993, 2001; Raney, 2003; Rashotte & Torgesen, 1985, for reviews). Upon rereading, the text is read more fluently (faster and more accurately) with no loss in comprehension. It is well accepted that this effect is attributable to a memory representation of the text formed during the first reading, which is recruited to facilitate processing during subsequent readings. Using this methodology, researchers can systematically manipulate perceptual, lexical, syntactic, and conceptual features between readings to investigate how texts are represented in memory. The size of the repetition effect is used as an index of how much the first reading facilitates processing during the second encounter. In conjunction with the experimental manipulations, a repetition effect serves as an implicit measure of the kind of text representation formed during the first reading (Levy, 1993). Though a number of studies have investigated the nature of text representation, there is little consensus as to how text memory facilitates reading. At the heart of the debate is the question of whether the repetition effect is mediated by abstract word representations or by specific episodic text representations. …"

Accounts of visual word recognition allow semantic information to facilitate performance but have neglected the role of modalityspecific perceptual attention in activating meaning. We predicted that modality-specific semantic information would differentially facilitate lexical decision and reading aloud, depending on how perceptual attention is implicitly directed by each task. Large-scale regression analyses showed the perceptual modalities involved in representing a word’s referent concept influence how easily that word is recognized. Both lexical decision and reading-aloud tasks direct attention toward vision, and are faster and more accurate for strongly visual words. Reading aloud additionally directs attention toward audition and is faster and more accurate for strongly auditory words. Furthermore, the overall semantic effects are as large for reading aloud as lexical decision and are separable from age-of-acquisition effects. These findings suggest that implicitly directing perceptual attention toward a particular modality facilitates representing modality-specific perceptual information in the meaning of a word, which in turn contributes to the lexical decision or reading-aloud response."

START,START,2321225084,reading in subjects with an oral cleft speech hearing and neuropsychological skills,2014,"amy l conrad, thomasin e mccoy, ian devolder, lynn c richman, peg nopoulos",neuropsychology (journal),1,20,0,"Research extending back 50 years has documented a strong occurrence of language disorders (LD) among children with non-syndromic cleft of the lip and/or palate (NSCL/P; Conrad, Richman, Nopoulos, & Dailey, 2009; Goldstein et al., 2007; Hentges et al., 2011; Lamb, Wilson, & Leeper, 1972; Nopoulos, Berg, VanDemark, et al., 2002; Roberts, Mathias, & Wheaton, 2012). This is most often reflected in a high occurrence of Dyslexia in children with NSCL/P (Broder, Richman, & Matheson, 1998; Chapman, 2011; Collett, Stott-Miller, Kapp-Simon, Cunningham, & Speltz, 2010; Richman, Eliason, & Lindgren, 1988; Richman & Ryan, 2003; Richman, Wilgenbusch, & Hall, 2005). For some subgroups this appears to be a developmental lag where reading skills improve in adolescence, though others continue to demonstrate a deficit into adulthood (Richman, et al., 1988).

Early on, it was hypothesized that the high rates of Dyslexia and LD were due either to poor articulation resulting from the abnormal oral cavity or hearing loss secondary to frequent episodes of Otitis Media (Amaral, Martins, & Santos, 2010; Chapman, 2011; Collett, Stott-Miller, et al., 2010). These disruptions to sensory input at critical developmental times were hypothesized to impair phonological awareness, a key skill required for reading (Ramus, 2003). Research supporting this theory has found correlations between early speech issues (Chapman, 2011), poor hearing (Boscariol, Andre, & Feniman, 2009; Collett, Stott-Miller, et al., 2010) and reading outcomes.

However, there have been some criticisms of this theory. Research within the general population has shown normal phonological development in persons with severe speech disabilities (Ramus, Pidgeon, & Frith, 2003), which suggests that phonological representations are not solely a product of speech articulation (Ramus et al., 2003). Second, there are studies among people with NSCL/P that demonstrate no relationship between articulation, hearing, and reading or language outcome (Ceponiene, Haapanen, Ranta, Naatanen, & Hukki, 2002; Hentges, et al., 2011; Lamb, et al., 1972; Shriver, Canady, Richman, Andreasen, & Nopoulos, 2006). These findings suggest that there may be something more than disrupted speech or hearing influencing language and reading skills among people with NSCL/P.

In order to better understand the neurological underpinnings of these outcomes, some research has evaluated neuropsychological skills associated with reading (i.e., phonological awareness, rapid labeling, and auditory/visual memory). Studies have shown related deficiencies in rapid labeling and auditory/visual memory compared to controls (Brennan & Cullinan, 1974; Ceponiene, et al., 2002; Ceponiene et al., 1999; Nopoulos, Berg, VanDemark, et al., 2002; Richman & Ryan, 2003; Richman, et al., 2005; Smith & McWilliams, 1968). Although, there has been some research that has found no differences in reading or these related skills (Chapman, 2011; Collett, Leroux, & Speltz, 2010; Smith & McWilliams, 1968).

In support of a theory of neuropsychological deficits, our laboratory has documented abnormal brain structure in both children (Nopoulos, Langbehn, Canady, Magnotta, & Richman, 2007) and adults with NSCL/P (Nopoulos, Berg, Canady, et al., 2002; Nopoulos et al., 2005). These changes in brain structure are hypothesized to be due to abnormal brain development that occurs in parallel with the abnormality in facial development. Establishing a relationship between reading performance and specific language-based neuropsychological skills would support the notion that the reading disabilities may be rooted in abnormal brain structure and function, rather than a secondary effect from deprivation of sensory input.

One weakness in this body of literature is that the majority of recent research evaluating language and reading skills are focused on younger subjects (maximum age around 8 years old), in whom reading skills are just starting to develop. A close evaluation of articulation, hearing, neuropsychological skill, and reading among an older sample, where reading skill is stronger or more established, is lacking.

The purpose of this study was to obtain measures of word reading, neuropsychological skill, speech production, and history of hearing in children, adolescents, and young adults with NSCL/P. Key questions for evaluation included: 1) What is the effect of sex, age and group membership on reading outcome for subjects with and without cleft? 2) What is the relationship of reading skill to measures of neuropsychological skill, speech, and hearing? It was hypothesized that reading skill would increase with age for all subjects; however, there may be a group-by-age interaction where reading for subjects with NSCL/P is discrepant at younger ages and “catches-up” in young adulthood. It was also expected that neuropsychological skill would be associated to reading outcome, but results for speech and hearing were not predicted."

Bowers (2001) proposed that processes underlying performance on the RAN task and orthographic knowledge make independent and additive contributions to reading performance. We examined the benefits of training orthographic pattern recognition and speeded letter recognition for children in Grades 1 and 2 with slow naming speed. Children first received training in either orthographic pattern recognition or speeded letter recognition, and then switched to the other type of training. Results indicated that speeded letter recognition can improve through training, but only when preceded by training in orthographic pattern recognition. Orthographic pattern recognition training improved the accuracy and speed of reading training words, whether training occurred alone or following letter training. Letter training prior to the orthographic training provided no additional benefit. Together, these results argue for the importance of orthographic training for children with slow naming speed."

That is, would the same behavior, such as persisting through a tedious and attentionally demanding task, show different associations with trait self-control when it is framed as benefitting the self versus someone else? In Studies 1�3, we directly compared the personal and social dos and found that trait self-control predicted self-reported and behavioral personal dos but not social dos, even when the behaviors were identical and when the incentives were matched. Instead, trait agreeableness�a trait linked to successful self-regulation within the social domain�predicted the social dos.

This view has had a major impact in economics, law, medicine, and other fields; indeed, the idea that people cannot reason with probabilities has become a truism. We present a simple alternative to this view, where people reason about probability according to probability theory but are subject to random variation or noise in the reasoning process. In this account the effect of noise is canceled for some probabilistic expressions. Analyzing data from 2 experiments, we find that, for these expressions, people’s probability judgments are strikingly close to those required by probability theory. For other expressions, this account produces systematic deviations in probability estimates. These deviations explain 4 reliable biases in human probabilistic reasoning (conservatism, subadditivity, conjunction, and disjunction fallacies). These results suggest that people’s probability judgments embody the rules of probability theory and that biases in those judgments are due to the effects of random noise."

To explore this possibility, we placed humans and monkeys in successive uncertainty-monitoring tasks that were qualitatively different, eliminating many associative cues that might support transfer across tasks. In addition, task transfer occurred under conditions of deferred and rearranged feedback—both species completed blocks of trials followed by summary feedback. This ensured that animals received no trial-by-trial reinforcement. Despite distancing performance from associative cues, humans and monkeys still made adaptive uncertainty responses by declining the most difficult trials. These findings suggest that monkeys’ uncertainty responses could represent a higher-level, decisional process of cognitive monitoring, though that process need not involve full self-awareness or consciousness.

Both the intrinsic importance of skill in simple calculation for math and the influence of conceptual knowledge and cognitive factors (working memory, processing speed, oral language) on simple calculation and math are plausible. The authors investigated the development of basic calculation fluency and its relations to math achievement and other factors by tracking a group of 259 United Kingdom English children from second to third grade. In both grades the group did not retrieve the solutions to most problems, but their math achievement was typical. Improvement in basic calculation proficiency was partially predicted by conceptual knowledge and cognitive factors. These factors only partially mediated the relation between basic calculation and math achievement. The relation between reading and math was wholly mediated by number measures and cognitive factors."

This study of 3rd graders (N = 258) finds both domain-general and numerical factors contribute independently to explaining variation in 3 significant arithmetic skills: basic calculation fluency, written multidigit computation, and arithmetic word problems. Estimation accuracy and number system knowledge show the strongest associations with every skill, and their contributions are independent of both each other and other factors. Different domain-general factors independently account for variation in each skill. Numeral comparison, a single digit processing skill, uniquely accounts for variation in basic calculation. Subsamples of children with MLD (at or below 10th percentile, n = 29) are compared with low achievement (LA, 11th to 25th percentiles, n = 42) and typical achievement (above 25th percentile, n = 187). Examination of these and subsets with persistent difficulties supports a multiple deficits view of number difficulties: Most children with number difficulties exhibit deficits in both domain-general and numerical factors. The only factor deficit common to all persistent MLD children is in multidigit skills. These findings indicate that many factors matter but multidigit skills matter most in 3rd grade mathematical achievement."

Results indicated considerable variability in their definitions, with perceptions of hate crimes differing with regard to demographic characteristics of both victims and perceivers. Victims may experience hate crimes differently because of who they are, why they are victimized, and with whom they share their experiences. In a separate study, males and females each evaluated a scenario of a hate crime perpetrated upon a male or female victim. Whether the crime was described as motivated by racial or religious bigotry, heterosexism, or was ambiguous was systematically varied. The demographic status of the participant appeared to determine how disruptive they regarded the crime scenario, and the likelihood that they would report personal knowledge of a victim of a similar type of assault. None of the participants was likely to report knowledge of a victim of a heterosexist assault. Policy implications of results from both studies are discussed."

A comparison group watched a different preschool program one time. Viewer behavior was videotaped, and comprehension and learning of Blue's Clues content was tested. With repetition, looking at the television screen remained at a high level. Only 5-year-old boys' looking decreased. Verbal and nonverbal interactions with the program (such as answering questions and pointing at the screen) increased, especially during educational content. Comprehension improved with repetition. Episode repetition is an effective strategy for enhancing learning and program involvement for a preschool audience. Preschool children often ask for repetition of storybooks and videos. Mares (1998) surveyed parents of children aged 2 to 17 years about frequency of repeated videotape viewing. Sixty-nine percent of parents of children aged 2 to 4 reported that their children ""almost always"" watched videos repeatedly. The parents of less than 10% of the children in this age group reported that their children ""very rarely"" or ""never"" watched videos repeatedly. The percentage of children who ""almost always"" watched repeatedly substantially decreased with age beyond the preschool years. Almost any theory of comprehension would predict that children's comprehension of a television program improves with repetition. In the small amount of research concerning television that has examined this issue, the prediction has been supported. Peracchio (1992) studied the effects of repetition on the acquisition of the event knowledge of a product-exchange story presented aurally or audiovisually .

Participants learned artificial lexicons (48 words) containing phonologically similar items and were tested on their knowledge in a 4-alternative forced-choice (4AFC) referent-selection task. Lexical stress differences did not reduce confusions between cohort items: KAdazu and kaDAzeI were confused with one another in a 4AFC task and in gaze fixations as often as BOsapeI and BOsapaI. However, lexical stress did affect the relative likelihood of stress-initial confusions when words were embedded in running nonsense speech. Words with medial stress, regardless of initial vowel quality, were more prone to confusions than words with initial stress.

African American (n = 235), Latin American (n = 56), and European American (n = 136) children completed measures of their anxiety, cognitive schemas reflecting impaired autonomy/performance and disconnection/rejection domains, and maternal control. Results indicated that a disconnection/rejection negative cognitive style mediated the effect of perceived maternal control on childhood anxiety only for the European American group. Maternal control was associated with the impaired autonomy/performance cognitive style for each of the three ethnic groups and with a disconnection/rejection cognitive style only for the European American and Latin American groups. Maternal control had an indirect effect on anxiety through the disconnection/rejection cognitive style for the Latin American group.

These causal theories help resolve the puzzle of egocentric pattern projection�the tendency for people to assume that traits correlate in the population in the same way they align in the self. Causal trait theories�created to explain trait co-occurrence in a single person�are exported to guide one�s implicit personality theories about people in general (Study 2). Pattern projection was found to be largely egocentric (i.e., more strong guided by self- than by social perceptions) for 2 reasons. First, causal trait theories are more numerous for the self. When participants were prompted to generate causal trait theories about someone else, they pattern projected more from that person (Study 3). Second, causal trait theories about the self are more likely to draw on behavioral information from multiple contexts instead of merely seeking to explain why 2 traits co-occur in a single context. Causal trait theories based on trait-relevant behaviors from different contexts, instead of trait co-occurrence within a single context, produce more pattern projection (Study 4).

It also examined pathways that connect social integration to better lung health. Methods: High functioning men (n 518) and women (n 629) ages 70–79 were recruited as part of the MacArthur Study of Successful Aging, and data were collected on social roles as well as pulmonary function as assessed by peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Multiple regressions predicting PEFR from the number of social roles controlled for age, sex, race, education, weight, and height. Physiological, behavioral, social, and psychological factors were tested as mediators of the association between the number of social roles and PEFR. Results: More social roles were associated with better PEFR. Analysis of specific roles indicated that marriage was the strongest positive correlate of PEFR. However, greater numbers of roles were also associated with better PEFR independent of marriage. Being a relative or friend were each also individually associated with better PEFR. Even so, greater numbers of social roles were associated with better PEFR independent of relative and friend. The data were consistent with greater happiness, not smoking, and more physical activity acting as pathways linking the number of roles to PEFR. Conclusions: Number of social roles is an important correlate of healthy lung function in the elderly. This association may be driven by healthier behaviors and greater feelings of well-being."

The model hypothesizes relationships among background knowledge, inferences, reading comprehension strategies, vocabulary, and word reading and addresses the direct and mediated effects of these 5 predictors on comprehension. The authors tested the fit of the model and 3 variations of the model to data from 175 students in 9th grade. The DIME model explained 66% of the variance in comprehension. Vocabulary and background knowledge made the largest contributions to comprehension, followed by inference, word reading, and strategies. Analyses of participants scoring below the 30th percentile on comprehension showed these students to have low scores on all of the measures. The authors suggest that vocabulary and background knowledge interventions might be the best way to begin improving the academic reading comprehension of students like those in the sample."

As predicted, positive-induction participants judged their health more favorably than negative-induction participants. Experiment 2 examined the mediating role of illness-relevant thinking in this mood effect. After seeing one of the two mood-induction tapes, some participants were asked to imagine either an illness-related or illness-unrelated scenario. A third group was given no instructions concerning imagination. As predicted, the relative effect of negative mood on health appraisal was attenuated only among those who imagined a scenario unrelated to health. Furthermore, the pattern of symptom recall data mirrored the self-appraisal findings.

Recent auditory studies have shown impaired sensitivity to amplitude rise time (ART) in children with SLIs, along with non-speech rhythmic timing difficulties. Linguistically, these perceptual impairments should affect sensitivity to speech prosody and syllable stress. Here we used two tasks requiring sensitivity to prosodic structure, the DeeDee task and a stress misperception task, to investigate this hypothesis. We also measured auditory processing of ART, rising pitch and sound duration, in both speech (“ba”) and non-speech (tone) stimuli. Participants were 45 children with SLI aged on average 9 years and 50 age-matched controls. We report data for all the SLI children (N = 45, IQ varying), as well as for two independent SLI subgroupings with intact IQ. One subgroup, “Pure SLI”, had intact phonology and reading (N=16), the other, ""SLI PPR"" (N=15), had impaired phonology and reading. Problems with syllable stress and prosodic structure were found for all the group comparisons. Both sub-groups with intact IQ showed reduced sensitivity to ART in speech stimuli, but the PPR subgroup also showed reduced sensitivity to sound duration in speech stimuli. Individual differences in processing syllable stress were associated with auditory processing. These data support a new hypothesis, the ‘prosodic phrasing’ hypothesis, which proposes that grammatical difficulties in SLI may reflect perceptual difficulties with global prosodic structure related to auditory impairments in processing amplitude rise time and duration."

In the present study, we experimentally tested the idea that experiencing a negative emotion triggers a ruminative process that drains working memory (WM) resources normally devoted to other tasks. Undergraduate participants of high versus low WM capacity were administered the operation-word memory span test (OSPAN) as a measure of availability of WM resources preceding and following the presentation of negative emotional versus neutral material. Rumination was assessed immediately after the second OSPAN session and at a 24-hr delay. Results showed that both the individual'sWMcapacity and the emotional valence of the material influencedWM performance and the persistence of ruminative thoughts. Following the experimental induction, rumination mediated the relationship between the negative emotional state and the concomitant WM performance. Based on these results, we argue that ruminative processes deplete WM resources, making them less available for concurrent tasks; in addition, rumination tends to persist over time.

Concurrently, hierarchical regressions revealed that a greater proportion of total variance in inference making was explained by vocabulary and verbal working memory for younger than older children. Vocabulary breadth was a stronger predictor of inference than verbal working memory but the opposite pattern was found for vocabulary depth and verbal working memory. The longitudinal relations between inference making, vocabulary and verbal working memory were investigated in two separate cross-lagged models: one with vocabulary breadth and a second with vocabulary depth. Both vocabulary breadth and depth explained subsequent inference making and verbal working memory throughout the early grades. Inference making also predicted subsequent vocabulary depth.

Results indicated that no variable in the model could fully `explain' RSN; processing speed, but not articulation, contributed to RSN performance. RSN and orthographic knowledge were significantly related, but this relationship was due to the effects of processing speed. In terms of their unique contributions to the variance in word reading, RSN, phonological awareness, and orthographic knowledge were independent of each other.

Subjects controlled viewing duration by a button press that led to the onset of the next stimulus. They also responded to targets by pressing a foot pedal. The amount of time spent looking at different kinds of stimuli served as a measure of visual attention and exploratory activity.

In Experiment 3, priming effects were found even when different photos of the same people were presented at study and at test. These results suggest that the processing of age is mediated by memory representations of facial identity."

However, most tests of SCCT to date have focused exclusively on person-level, perceptual barriers rather than objective, macroeconomic barriers that may influence large groups of people. In this study, we examine how the effects of personal experiences with financial strain among a sample of adults who are unemployed are qualified by regional unemployment rates. Results indicated that financial strain has a direct, negative relation with job search self-efficacy, and indirect, negative relations with job search outcome expectations and search goals. These direct and indirect relations are moderated by unemployment rates and are only significant for participants residing in U.S. counties with high unemployment. These findings highlight the importance of taking into account broader contextual influences when studying vocational outcomes and demonstrate the applicability of incorporating macroeconomic barriers and supports into SCCT in future research."

purpose of this study was to examine the development of morphological and phonological
awareness and their impact on later reading skills. Two training programs
(morphological and phonological awareness) were conducted in kindergarten and
were compared to no-intervention control group. Phonological and morphological
tests and other general abilities were measured for 90 children at kindergarten
as pre and post intervention tests. Tests in reading and spelling were carried
out at the middle of grade 1. Results showed that the morphological and the
phonological intervention programs enhanced both phonological and morphological
awareness, in comparison to the control group, with a small advantage for the morphological
group. In grade 1, no significant differences were found between the
intervention groups and the control group in reading and spelling measures.
Altogether the results of the current study suggest that the intervention
programs were less effective than expected in the first graders compared to
results of Carlisle
(1995) and Lyster
(2002),
but support former findings found by Ibrahim et al. (2007). This result may relate in part to the additional visual complexity of
Arabic orthography. The psycholinguistic implications of these findings

Data from individually administered measures of phonological processing and reading, as well as teacher ratings of children's behavior, were collected from a cohort of 132 children at 12-month intervals, from kindergarten to 2nd grade. Results from multiple linear regression analyses employing latent constructs of phonological abilities and inattentive behavior provided support for the hypothesized model, with kindergarten measures of inattentiveness and phonological abilities predicting subsequent reading performance. An analysis of reciprocal relationships among these constructs revealed evidence that inattentiveness also interfered with the acquisition of phonological analysis skills.

We aimed to identify whether the frequently observed association between absolute levels of monetary resources and health may occur because money acts an indirect proxy for a person’s social rank. Method: To address this question we examined over 230,000 observations on 40,400 adults drawn from two representative national panel studies; the British Household Panel Survey and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. We identified each person’s absolute income/wealth and their objective ranked position of income/wealth within a social reference-group. Absolute and rank income/wealth variables were then used to predict a series of self-reported and objectively recorded health outcomes in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Results: As anticipated, those with higher levels of absolute income/wealth were found to have better health than others, after adjustment for age, gender, education, marital status, and labor force status. When evaluated simultaneously the ranked position of income/ wealth but not absolute income/wealth predicted all health outcomes examined including: objective measures of allostatic load and obesity, the presence of long-standing illness, and ratings of health, physical functioning, role limitations, and pain. The health benefits of high rank were consistent in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses and did not depend on the reference-group used to rank participants. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate that social position rather than material conditions may explain the impact of money on human health."
START,START,2115404241,articulatory duration in single word speech production,2003,markus f damian,journal of experimental psychology learning memory and cognition,1,61,47,"Three different speech production paradigms assessed C. T. Kello, D. C. Plaut, and B. MacWhinney’s (2000) claim that the characteristics of speech production flexibly vary between staged and cascaded modes depending on task demand. All experiments measured response latencies and durations of single words without and with a response deadline. Experiment 1 used a pictureword interference task; Experiment 2 blocked pictures either by semantic category or by word-initial overlap; and Experiment 3 used a Stroop paradigm. In all cases, systematic effects of semantic and form relatedness were obtained on latencies but not on response durations. These results support the assumption that articulation, as assessed by response duration, is never influenced by central cognitive processes once a response has been initiated. The representational stages involved in lexical retrieval for the production of simple utterances have recently generated a large amount of interest. Despite an elaborate controversy with regard to the exact characteristics of these representations, there is general agreement from a broader perspective that lexical access in speaking can be subdivided into a phase that is concerned with the retrieval of semantic characteristics and a phase that involves access to the phonological properties of the intended words (e.g., Garrett, 1975; Schriefers, Meyer, & Levelt, 1990; van Tourennout, Hagoort, & Brown, 1997; see Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999, for an overview). One of the issues surrounding lexical retrieval in speech production is the question of how these two stages relate to each other. Discrete two-step models (e.g., Levelt et al., 1999, 1991) assume that speaking proceeds in a serial manner from semantic to phonological retrieval, and that the two stages are largely encapsulated from each other. In contrast, cascaded (e.g., Humphreys, Riddoch, & Quinlan, 1988) or interactive (e.g., Dell, 1986; Dell & O’Seaghdha, 1991; Harley, 1993) speech production models dispute the modularity assumption and propose that processing proceeds from one to the other level in a gradual fashion such that semantic retrieval does not have to be entirely concluded before phonological access begins. 1"

However, whether word-length effects in single word production exist is at present controversial. A series of experiments did not find evidence for such an effect. First, an experimental manipulation of word length in picture naming showed no latency differences. Second, Dutch and English speakers named 2 sets of either objects or words (monosyllabic names in Dutch and disyllabic names in English or vice versa). A length effect, which should manifest itself as an interaction between object set and response language, emerged in word naming but not in picture naming. Third, distractors consisting of the final syllable of disyllabic object names speeded up responses, but at the same time, no word-length effect was found. These results suggest that before the response is initiated, an entire word has been phonologically encoded, but only its initial syllable is placed in an articulatory buffer."

To address these questions, we used a large U.S. sample (N = 1,795) that assessed people’s personality traits in adolescence and 50 years later. We also used 2 independent samples, 1 cross-sectional and 1 short-term longitudinal (N = 3,934 and N = 38, respectively), to validate the personality scales and estimate measurement error. This was the first study to test personality stability/change over a 50-year time span in which the same data source was tapped (i.e., self-report). This allowed us to use 4 different methods (rank-order stability, mean-level change, individual-level change, and profile stability) answering different developmental questions. We also systematically tested gender differences. We found that the average rank-order stability was .31 (corrected for measurement error) and .23 (uncorrected). The average mean-level change was half of a standard deviation across personality traits, and the pattern of change showed maturation. Individual-level change also supported maturation, with 20% to 60% of the people showing reliable change within each trait. We tested 3 aspects of personality profile stability, and found that overall personality profile stability was .37, distinctive profile stability was .17, and profile normativeness was .51 at baseline and .62 at the follow-up. Gender played little role in personality development across the life span. Our findings suggest that personality has a stable component across the life span, both at the trait level and at the profile level, and that personality is also malleable and people mature as they age.

If they do not have a distinct cognitive style or strategy, but are merely poor in using sequential (Successive) strategies, then, would the same processes that influence reading performance in the general population determine their performance as well? A sample of 84 Canadian First Nations (FN) children were assessed in word and pseudoword reading, rapid naming speed, and ability to process information using the Planning, Attention, Successive, and Simultaneous (PASS) theory of intelligence. Results confirmed that this sample of children did not exhibit a specific cognitive style. Rather, there was evidence of a weakness in Successive processing only in the subgroup of poor readers.

Current models of this lexical matching process posit context-specific letter codes in which letter representations are tied to either specific serial positions or specific local contexts (e.g., letter clusters). The spatial coding model described here adopts a different approach to letter position coding and lexical matching based on context-independent letter representations. In this model, letter position is coded dynamically, with a scheme called spatial coding. Lexical matching is achieved via a method called superposition matching, in which input codes and learned codes are matched on the basis of the relative positions of their common letters. Simulations of the model illustrate its ability to explain a broad range of results from the masked form priming literature, as well as to capture benchmark findings from the unprimed lexical decision task."

The current study used a dyadic approach to examine the impact of individual differences in core aspects of EF on indices of well-being in 91 married or cohabiting couples aged 55 years and older. Participants in each dyad completed EF tasks of inhibition, working memory, and task switching, control tasks of language and short-term memory (STM) in which EF demands were comparatively minimal, and self-report measures of depression and quality of life. Dyadic analyses showed that individuals with lower levels of EF self-reported more depressive symptoms, though there was no significant association between an individual's EF and their partner's self-reported mood. Conversely, individuals with lower levels of EF had partners who endorsed a lower quality of life, though there was no significant association between an individual's EF and their own quality of life ratings. Control tasks did not predict either aspect of well-being in either member of the dyad.

Experiment 2 corroborated these results: Accountable negotiators revised their FPPs even when information exchange was experimentally held constant.

As attention and reading deficits often co-occur in children, some tests associated with reading ability were added so that a distinction could be made between factors that are indicative for either deficit. A second aim of the study was to investigate the stability of the structure of the set of tests across subpopulations of boys and girls, and across subpopulations that differed according to the order of administration of the tests. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the structure of the tests could be adequately described by four correlated factors. In addition, the structure appeared to be highly stable across the subpopulations. The attention tests had their major loadings on three factors, namely Naming Speed, Visual Search and Memory Span. The reading tests generally loaded on Naming Speed and Verbal Learning. As Naming Speed and Visual Search were highly correlated, the major conclusion of the study is that the general capabilities measured by common attention tests are either speed or memory span."

In both conditions, half the students dictated and half the students wrote their plans and essays. The combination of dictation and instruction in advanced planning resulted in more complete and qualitatively better essays in contrast to those written by students in the comparison condition on both a posttest and 2-week maintenance probe.

However, its effectiveness to elicit generalized cognitive benefits is still under debate. Previous research yielded inconsistent findings and focused only little on the mechanisms underlying transfer effects. To disentangle training effects on WM capacity and efficiency, we evaluated near transfer to untrained, structurally different WM tasks and far transfer to closely related abilities (i.e., reasoning, processing speed, task switching, and inhibitory control) in addition to process-specific effects on three WM mechanisms (i.e., focus switching, removal of WM contents, and interference resolution). We randomly assigned 197 young adults to one of two experimental groups (updating or item-to-context binding) or to an active control group practicing visual search tasks. Before and after five weeks of adaptive training, performance was assessed measuring each of the cognitive processes and abilities of interest with four tasks covering verbal-numerical and visual-spatial materials. Despite the relatively large sample size, large practice effects in the trained tasks, and at least moderate correlations between WM training tasks and transfer measures, we found consistent evidence for the absence of any training-induced improvements across all ranges of transfer and mechanisms. Instead, additional analyses of error patterns and self-reported strategy use indicated that WM training encouraged the development of stimulus-specific expertise and use of paradigm-specific strategies. Thus, the results suggest that the WM training interventions examined here enhanced neither WM capacity nor the WM mechanisms assumed to underlie transfer."

It has recently been suggested that hypersensitivity to interference could prevent a person from storing arithmetic facts. The similarity between arithmetic facts would provoke interference, and learners who are hypersensitive to interference would therefore encounter difficulties in storing arithmetic facts in long-term memory. In this study, we created a measure of the interference weight for each multiplication by measuring the overlap of digits between multiplications. First, we tested whether the interference parameter could predict performance across multiplications by analyzing the data from undergraduates published by Campbell (1997). The interference parameter substantially predicted performance across multiplications. Similarly, the performance across multiplications was substantially determined by the interference parameter in 3rd-grade children, 5th-grade children, and undergraduates we tested. Second, we tested whether people with poor arithmetic facts abilities were particularly sensitive to the interference parameter. We tested this hypothesis in typical development by analyzing the data from the 3rd-grade children, 5th-grade children, and undergraduates. We analyzed data with regard to atypical development from a published case study of dyscalculia as well as from 4th-grade children, with either poor or good multiplication skills, tested twice 1 year apart. Results showed that the individual sensitivity to the interference parameter determined part of the individual differences in multiplication performance in all data sets. These findings show that the learning of multiplications is particularly interference prone because of feature overlap and that people who are sensitive to this parameter therefore encounter difficulties in memorizing arithmetic facts."

Participants were 100 Grade 2 children who were tested again in Grade 3. We evaluated the children’s morphological awareness and reading accuracy, each with 2 measures, in both Grades 2 and 3. We evaluated the outcomes in a robust measurement model including controls for phonological awareness, vocabulary, and nonverbal ability. These analyses included autoregressor controls designed to provide insight into the temporal relationship between these 2 skills. We found that children’s early morphological awareness was associated with their growth in reading accuracy to the same extent that their early reading accuracy was associated with their growth in morphological awareness. Our results suggest a bidirectional relationship between children’s morphological awareness and their reading accuracy, a finding that informs current models of reading development."

The researchers tracked the relationships between performance on past tense analogy tasks (the measure of morphological awareness) and reading of English and French in a group of 58 French immersion children across Grades 1–3. Early measures of English morphological awareness were significantly related to both English and French reading, after controlling for several variables. In contrast, early measures of French morphological awareness were significantly related to French reading only. Later measures of morphological awareness in French were significantly related to English and French reading. These relationships persisted even after controlling for several variables. Results of this study suggest that morphological awareness can be applied to reading across orthographies and that this relationship changes as children build their language and literacy skills. These findings are discussed in light of current theories of second-language reading acquisition."

However, a greater ability to control attention sometimes leads individuals with higher WMC to persist in using complex, attention-demanding approaches that are suboptimal for a given task. We examined whether higher WMC would hinder insight problem solving, which is thought to rely on associative processes that operate largely outside of close attentional control. In addition, we examined whether characteristics of the insight problems influence whether this negative relationship will be revealed. In Experiment 1, participants completed matchstick arithmetic problems, which require a similar initial problem representation for all problems. Higher WMC was associated with less accurate insight problem solving. In Experiment 2, participants completed insight word problems, which require substantially different representations for each problem. Higher WMC was again negatively associated with insight, but only after statistically controlling for shared variance between insight and incremental problem-solving accuracy. These findings suggest that WMC may benefit performance on fundamental processes common to both incremental and insight problem solving (e.g., initial problem representation), but hinder performance on the processes that are unique to insight (e.g., solution and restructuring). By considering the WMC of the individual, and the nature of the insight task, we may better understand the process of insight and how to best support it."

Cognitive correlates of RAN were investigated for 1307 children across a range of developmental ages (5–12 years). Cognitive predictors of RAN differed by developmental age, which may partially explain inconsistencies in previous research studies. Despite developmental variation, lexical access tasks were related to RAN performance across all developmental ages. Results from this study suggest RAN performance likely consists of multiple cognitive processes, both those associated with lexical access and others that depend on developmental age."

Finally, Study 3 revealed that while all kindergarteners started off at a similar level of essentialism towards ethnicity, exposure affected Arab, but especially Jewish, children’s essentialist beliefs. Moreover, there were negative correlations between the salience of and essentialism towards ethnicity.

The element of speed (of responding verbally to a visual stimulus) was derived from a test of color naming developed over 50 years ago as a bedside measure of recovery from brain injuries. Merging the “visual-verbal” connection essential to reading (specific) with the response time element (general), RAN turned out to be a useful correlate and predictor of reading competence, accounting even for variance beyond that accounted for by timed tests of discrete naming. As one of the two deficits highlighted in the Double Deficit hypothesis with phonological awareness, RAN has emerged as something more than a particularly difficult challenge to a unitary phonological retrieval deficit, and has itself been subjected to further dissection. Coming full circle to its origins, recent research suggests that RAN taps both visual-verbal (language domain) and processing speed (executive domain) contributions to reading."

START,START,2330501769,can executive functions help to understand children with mathematical learning disorders and to improve instruction,2013,"annemie desoete, frauke de weerdt",learning disabilities a contemporary journal,1,5,44,"Working memory, inhibition and naming speed was assessed on 22 children with a mathematical learning disorder, (MD) 28 children with a combined mathematical and reading disorder (MD+RD), 17 children with a reading learning disorder (RD) and 45 children without learning problems between 8 and 12 years old. All children with learning disorders performed poorly on working memory tasks, providing evidence that they have a deficiency related to simultaneously storage and processing of verbal and/or visuospatial information. In addition, children with MD+RD suffered from problems with quantity naming speed compared to children without MD. Our data revealed the importance to manage working memory loads and give more time to complete homework, exercises, and examinations. Introduction Specific Learning disorders (LD) are common in childhood (Beghi, Cornaggia, Frigeni, & Beghi, 2006; Dirks, Spyer, van Lieshout, & de Sonneville, 2008). The DSM 5 differentiates LD with impairment in reading, written expression and mathematics. Mathematical Disorders (MD) are defined as specific disorders with impairments in math abilities, at a level that is significantly below expected given the age and effective teaching. Moreover, the mathematical impairments in MD are not explained by extraneous factors, such as sensory deficits (Landerl et al., 2004; Passolunghi, Vercelloni, & Schadee, 2007) and have to be persistent (Fletcher et al., 2005). In order to be sure of the persistence of MD, it is important to consider consistency in performance over time (Fletcher et al., 2005; Mazzocco & Myers, 2003). Most researchers currently report a prevalence of MD between 3-14% of children (Barbaresi, Katusic, Colligan, Weaver, & Jacobsen, 2005; Rubinsten & Henik, 2009; Shalev, Manor, & Gross-Tsur, 2005). Recently, Geary (2011) estimated a prevalence of approximately 7% of children. Several hypotheses have often been studied to identify the origins of mathematical disorders (MD) in children (e.g., Butterworth, 1999; Wolf & Bowers, 1999). A deficit in working memory, inhibition or naming speed has been proposed to explain the problems in the underlying cognitive system that prevent children from developing age-adequate skills in MD (Bull & Scerif, 2001; Geary, Hoard, Byrd-Craven, Nugent, & Numtee, 2007; Passolunghi & Siegel, 2004) and combined reading disorders (RD) and MD (RD+MD; Pauly et al., 2011; van der Sluis, de Jong, & van der Leij, 2004; Willburger, Fussenegger, Moll, Wood, & Landerl, 2008). However, there are studies not supporting the hypothesis of such deficits (e.g., Censabella & Noel, 2005; Kibby, Marks, Morgan, & Long, 2004; Landerl, Bevan, & Butterworth, 2004). Thus, the empirical pattern is far from straightforward. Reading disorders (RD) are defined as impairments in reading and/or written expression (spelling abilities). These impairments are at a level that is significantly below expected given the age and effective teaching (Ziegler et al., 2008). The prevalence of RD is approximately between 5 to 12% of children (Schumacher, Hoffmann, Schmal, Schulte-Korne, & Nothen, 2007). However, since language and orthography play an important role in reading, prevalence of RD may differ across countries (Callens, Tops, & Brysbaert, 2012). Clear differences are marked between regular and more irregular orthographies and it assumed that different problems are manifested in RD in languages that embed regular grapheme-phoneme correspondence than in languages with a less transparent orthography and grapheme-phoneme mapping (Bergmann & Wimmer, 2008; Callens, Tops & Brysbaert, 2011). There are several hypotheses concerning the causes of RD. Deficits in phonologically related processes are often considered one of the core problems of RD (e.g., Peterson & Pennington, 2012; Vellutino et al., 2004), but there is also the double-deficit hypothesis of Wolf and Bowers (1999). This theory focuses both on phonological processing and naming speed. In addition Stein and Walsh (1997) revealed a general magnocellular deficit in children with RD, meaning that children with RD were unable to correctly process fast incoming visual and auditory information (Stein & Walsh, 1997). Finally, research has found evidence that deficits in working memory (Savage et al., 2007) are associated with RD. In addition also the role of inhibition in the reading process has been stressed (Schmid, Labuhn, & Hasselhorn, 2011). Failures to inhibit improper (though more dominant) pronunciations might impair word recognition performance in a more profound manner (Chiappe, Hasher, & Siegel, 2000). Executive functioning can be described as the general purpose control mechanisms that coordinate, regulate and control cognitive processes during the operation of cognitive tasks (Miyake et al., 2000) and are localized in the central executive control system of working memory (Baddeley, 1986). According to Baddeley (1986), working memory has to be seen as an active system that regulates complex cognitive behavior. His multicomponent model consists of a central executive component, a phonological loop and a visuospatial sketchpad. In the model, the central executive is an attentional control system, which executes the processing aspects of a task. The central executive strongly interacts with one multidimensional and two domain-specific storage systems. The phonological loop is responsible for the storage and maintenance of verbal information; the visuospatial sketchpad has similar responsibilities for visual and spatial information (Baddeley, 1986). Since the multicomponent model of Baddeley (1986) is used by the main part of LD studies investigating working memory (e.g., Passolunghi & Siegel, 2004; van der Sluis, van der Leij, & de Jong, 2005) this model will be used in this study. Forward recall tasks can be considered as measures of the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad, while backward recall and dual span tasks are used as measures of the central executive. In his heuristic taxonomy, Nigg (2000) separates executive inhibition from motivational and automatic inhibition. The former might be considered part of executive functioning. Executive or effortful inhibition is categorized in interference control, behavioral, oculomotor and cognitive inhibition (Nigg, 2000). Interference control refers to the ability to maintain response performance and suppress competing, distracting, or interfering stimuli that evoke a competing motor response (Nigg, 2000). It is often measured by Stroop and Flanker tasks. In addition, behavioral inhibition is seen as the capacity to suppress a prepotent or dominant response and entails the deliberate control of a primary motor response in compliance with changing context cues (Nigg, 2000). The Go/no-go is a frequently conducted measure of behavioral inhibition (e.g., Friedman & Miyake, 2004; Purvis & Tannock, 2000) and hence will be used in this study. Naming speed can be defined as those processes that underlie the rapid recognition and retrieval of visually presented linguistic stimuli (Wolf and Bowers, 1999) or as the ability to quickly recognize and name a restricted set of serially presented high frequency symbols, objects or colors (Heikkila, Narhi, Aro, & Ahonen, 2009; McGrath et al., 2011); and is often measured by a task based on the Rapid Automatized Naming paradigm of Denckla and Rudel (1974). Savage et al. (2005) found that number naming speed discriminated children with RD from control children. Both groups were between 7 and 10 years old. In addition D'Amico and Passolunghi (2009) found slower naming speed on both numbers and letters in 9 year old children with MD in comparison with age-matched control children. Hence, it is also unclear if naming speed problems are related to a deficit in letter or numerosity processing or if the problems are more general. Although the comorbidity between MD and RD is higher than would be expected by chance, little is known about the question if children with MD, RD or RD+MD perform poorly on all working memory, inhibition, and naming speed tasks or if they have a domain-specific deficit related to tasks requiring simultaneous storage and processing of verbal or numerical information. The principal objective of this study was therefore to gain more insight into the (modality-specific or domain-general) cognitive processes underlying MD with and without RD and into the relationship between learning disorders themselves. Method Participants The participants were 112 children (45 control children, 22 MD children, 28 RD+MD children and 17 RD children) between 8 and 12 years old. The characteristics of the participants are described in Table 1. NA NA Control children came regular elementary schools and children diagnosed with MD, RD or RD+MD were referred by paraprofessionals with a clinical diagnosis of learning disorder. All children were tested on math-, reading and spelling measures to control if criteria were met. Control children had to achieve a score above the 25 percentile on all tests. In congruence with Geary (2011) referred children with MD had to score ≤ the 10 percentile on at least one of the frequently used standardized math tests, measuring mental arithmetic and number knowledge (procedural skills) and fact retrieval. Children with RD had to achieve a score ≤ the 10 percentile on a spelling test and/ reading tests, measuring word reading speed and pseudoword reading. Children with RD+MD had to score ≤ the 10 percentile on at least one math test and ≤ the 10 percentile on at least one spellingor reading test (Dirks, Spyer, van Lieshout, & de Sonneville, 2008; Murphy, Mazzocco, Hanich, & Early, 2007)."
START,START,1973652832,literacy development in canada,2008,"alain desrochers, sonya major",canadian psychology,1,1,20,"Literacy development has been found to have a considerable influence on individuals' lives, modern society, and its economy. As a consequence, a great deal of attention has been devoted to the facets of literacy, the conditions that facilitate its development, and its impact. This special issue of Canadian Psychology provides a sample of current research programmes carried out on literacy development by Canadian researchers in psychology and education. The topics addressed include emergent literacy, the longitudinal prediction of reading development, the development of oral reading and reading comprehension, literacy development amongst French immersion students, the importance of culturally and developmentally appropriate practices in literacy instruction, and the prevention of reading difficulties. The concluding article provides an overview of the current definitions of learning/reading disabilities in Canadian provinces and territories. Keywords: literacy development, emergent literacy, prediction and prevention of reading difficulties, development of oral reading and reading comprehension, reading instruction The Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted in 1948 set forth the principle of education for all and universal literacy. Still today, it is estimated that over 770 million adults around the world are illiterate, including 130 million young people (ages 15 to 24), and these estimates are expected to remain unchanged in 2015 (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2004, 2005). The factors responsible for illiteracy or insufficient literacy are numerous and complex. They include limited access to schooling (e.g., in developing countries) and inadequate preparation for reading instruction (e.g., in disadvantaged areas; Magnuson, Meyers, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2004). Recent literacy surveys rank Canada amongst the top five industrialized countries around the world for its high literacy rate. Yet the 2003 survey results indicate that the literacy skills of 40% of Canadian adults (ages 16 to 65) fall below the level that is considered necessary for an entry-level job in modern society and economy (Statistics Canada, 2004, 2005). The consequences of illiteracy or low literacy skills are broad ranging: They include lower school achievement (e.g., persistence, competence), poorer physical and mental health (e.g., life expectancy), and lower employability and work productivity. Several national and international organisations have urged decision makers to take action to foster literacy development for all. The Canadian Council on Learning (2007) emphasized that ""Canada cannot afford to be complacent about literacy"" (p. 121) as there are still significant challenges to be addressed. Because nearly all countries around the world face similar challenges, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (2002) has called the period of 2003 to 2012 the Literacy Decade. The practise of equating literacy with alphabetization is now viewed as inadequate to address illiteracy as a sociopolitical problem that affects lifelong learning, personal and cultural identity, citizenship, equality of opportunities, governance, and civil society. A broader perspective has led to increasingly encompassing definitions of the term literacy. For instance, UNESCO experts now define literacy as ""the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider society"" (UNESCO, 2004, p. 13). In an attempt to reconcile different perspectives, UNESCO experts broke down the concept of literacy into four facets. First, literacy can be viewed as the set of cognitive skills that are necessary to read and write. …"

One hundred fifty-nine English-speaking Canadian, 238 French-speaking Canadian, and 224 Greek children were assessed at the beginning of Grade 2 on measures of morphological awareness, phonological awareness, and RAN. At the end of Grade 2, they were assessed on reading accuracy, reading fluency, reading comprehension, and spelling to dictation. The results indicated that morphological awareness was a unique predictor of reading comprehension and spelling in all three languages, of reading fluency in English and French, and of reading accuracy in English only. Furthermore, the results of multigroup analyses revealed no significant differences in the contribution of morphological awareness to the literacy outcomes across languages. Theoretical and practical implications of these finding are discussed."

Targets were either syntactically congruent or syntactically incongruent with the structure of the sentence. Relative to a neutral condition, similar facilitation and inhibition was found for congruent and incongruent targets, respectively. When syntactic congruency was blocked, the inhibition was attenuated, whereas the facilitation remained the same. A 350-ms silent interstimulus interval between context and target increased inhibition without affecting facilitation. We suggest that both the facilitation and the inhibition effects of syntactic priming are based on a veiled controlled process of generating expectations. The inhibition results from a controlled process of reevaluation that requires additional attention resources."

Study 1 shows that the proliferation of fast-food restaurants over the past 3 decades in the developed world was associated with a historic shift in financial impatience, as manifested in precipitously declining household savings rates. Study 2 finds that households saved less when living in neighborhoods with a higher concentration of fast-food restaurants relative to full-service restaurants. With a direct measure of individuals’ delay discounting preferences, Study 3 confirms that a higher concentration of fast-food restaurants within one’s neighborhood is associated with greater financial impatience. In line with a causal relationship, Study 4 reveals that recalling a recent fast-food, as opposed to full-service, dining experience at restaurants within the same neighborhood induced greater delay discounting, which was mediated behaviorally by how quickly participants completed the recall task itself. Finally, Study 5 demonstrates that pedestrians walking down the same urban street exhibited greater delay discounting in their choice of financial reward if they were surveyed in front of a fast-food restaurant, compared to a full-service restaurant. Collectively, these data indicate a link between the prevalence of fast food and financial impatience across multiple levels of analysis, and suggest the plausibility of fast food having a reinforcing effect on financial impatience. The present investigation highlights how the pervasiveness of organizational cues in the everyday social ecology can have a far-ranging influence."

A series of experiments tested the hypothesis that social exclusion increases the inclination to perceive neutral information as hostile, which has implications for aggression. Compared to accepted and control participants, socially excluded participants were more likely to rate aggressive and ambiguous words as similar (Experiment 1a), to complete word fragments with aggressive words (Experiment 1b), and to rate the ambiguous actions of another person as hostile (Experiments 2-4). This hostile cognitive bias among excluded people was related to their aggressive treatment of others who were not involved in the exclusion experience (Experiments 2 and 3), and others with whom participants had no previous contact (Experiment 4). These findings provide a first step in resolving the mystery of why social exclusion produces aggression."

To test this hypothesis we used fMRI to scan a sample of 104 healthy adults, as they performed a difficult WM task. Intellect (and not Openness) was found to correlate with WM accuracy and with accuracy-related brain activity, in left lateral anterior prefrontal cortex and posterior medial frontal cortex. Neural activity in these regions mediated the association between Intellect and WM performance, implicating these regions in the neural substrate of Intellect. Intellect was also correlated significantly with scores on tests of intelligence and working memory capacity, but the association of Intellect with brain activity could not be entirely explained by cognitive ability."

The neuroimaging data did show remarkable differences between the ADHD and control adults: Adults with ADHD engaged more strongly the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, middle temporal gyrus, precuneus, lingual gyrus, precentral gyrus, and insula than did the healthy controls during task switching. Controls displayed more task-related activity in the putamen, posterior cingulate gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, and postcentral gyrus.

In particular, given this combination, the poorest fitting individuals exhibited lower attraction levels, whereas more moderately fitting individuals exhibited invariant attraction levels across combinations of aesthetics and customized information. The results suggest that, given good aesthetics, customized information exerts effects mostly by causing poorly fitting individuals to be less attracted, which further suggests a means of averting the ""dark side"" of Web recruitment that occurs when organizations receive too many applications from poorly fitting applicants."
START,START,2078651399,a longitudinal analysis of friendships and substance use bidirectional influence from adolescence to adulthood,2002,"thomas j dishion, lee d owen",developmental psychology,1,300,62,"abstract construct to real-time behavior (see Fiske, 1986). Indeed,direct observations of friendship have enriched understanding ofthe dark side of friendships (see Hartup, 1996), revealing a processof interchange that appears salient to the development of problembehavior.Consistent with the second hypothesis, these data suggest that animportant secondary function of substance use may be the powerof drugs to connect individuals within peer groups. Lifestyle, asreflected in drug attitudes and behaviors, may be the currency withwhich a person shops for relationships (Patterson et al., 1992).Unbeknownst to most people, those relationships then shape theirattitudes and behavior. Deviance, in particular, seems to be a rathersalient sorting feature in the friendship selection process. Theextent to which two adolescent males organize their friendships ondeviance, as seen here, seems to be relevant to a variety of problembehaviors and developmental outcomes. Selection and influence,therefore, go hand and fist. This finding is consistent with ecolog-ical perspectives on social development, which emphasize theprimary role of relationships (Bronfenbrenner, 1989; Dishion,French, & Patterson, 1995; Hinde, 1989; Patterson & Reid, 1984).This research captures a developmentally significant transition.Substance use by age 15 has been shown to be prognostic ofsubstance abuse by young adulthood when other factors such asproblem behavior are controlled (Robins & Przybeck, 1985). How-ever, it appears that not all substances are equal with respect torisk. The most unique finding is that alcohol use in adolescence isnot a good predictor of young adult alcohol use or abuse inadulthood. This finding is in agreement with those of other inves-tigators (e.g., Donovan, Jessor, & Costa, 1991). The general as-sumption is that alcohol use in adolescence is practically norma-tive (Hops, Davis, & Lewin, 1999), and certainly it is by youngadulthood (i.e., normally distributed). Perhaps because alcohol useis a normative behavior in this culture in late adolescence toadulthood, the dynamics associated with its emergence do notfit the developmental pattern characteristic of other problembehaviors.Heterogeneity in developmental trends also emerged in thelongitudinal analysis of young adult drug abuse, providing partialsupport for the third hypothesis of this study. In general, overalllevels of substance use predicted marijuana abuse, dangerous druguse, and drug injection. Deviant friendship process, however,accounted for only marijuana use and drug injection. It is alsoimportant to note that these models account for relatively lowlevels of variation in adult drug abuse (6% to 20%), suggesting thatthere is much to be learned about the ecology and dynamics ofyoung adult substance abuse.Unexpected findings were those showing an interaction betweendeviant friendships and substance use in the prediction of danger-ous drug use. Visual inspection of the data suggests a subgroup ofadolescents who used substances, and did not seem to have deviantfriends, but nonetheless escalated to high levels of dangerous druguse as young adults. These youth seem to be on a trajectory that isnot only unique but alarming, a path difficult to interpret from aproblem behavior perspective. Loeber (1988) identified a puresubstance use group (i.e., not accompanied by other problembehaviors) in his formulation of adolescent developmental trajec-tories; however, follow-up data were unavailable at that time todiscern the developmental pathway into adulthood. A larger sam-ple is needed for more careful analysis of adolescent subgroups inorder to understand diverse influences on their substance-usingpatterns. It is possible that sibling or parent drug use promotesearly onset in youth otherwise on a normative developmental path(Brook, Brook, & Whiteman, 1999).The implication of the present research for prevention is rela-tively straightforward: Prevention efforts must focus on both theindividual and the peer ecology. Research by Botvin (2000) sug-gests that promoting social influence skills in schools can preventearly-onset substance use. This research suggests that, in addition,emphasis on how peer environments are structured needs attentionwithin prevention programs. A current prevention trial focusesexclusively on parenting practices in the middle school years(Dishion & Kavanagh, 2000). Initial findings show that engagingparents in services that support parenting are producing reducedgrowth in deviant peer involvement and substance use (Dishion,Bullock, & Granic, in press; Dishion, Kavanagh, Nelson,Schneiger, & Kaufman, in press). In addition, randomly assigninghigh-risk youth to interventions that aggregate peers can actuallyincrease problem behavior and drug use (Dishion et al., 1999).Clearly, both studies suggest that adults can and do structureenvironments that are highly relevant to the formation of peerecologies, which are conducive to progressions in problembehavior.These findings also suggest that the task of treatment programsfor drug abuse is both complex and formidable. In young adoles-cence, use of substances may have two functions, the most obviousbeing the function of changing affective states and inducing eu-phoria. The second, perhaps as pernicious, is the function ofproviding a form of commerce with the social world for the druguser. Inasmuch as substance use plays a central role in a youngperson’s relationship organization, alternative interpersonal set-tings and strategies are critical to emphasize in the endeavor topromote abstinence and well-being in the young adult years. Theyoung adult years are a critical transition point for many individ-uals, when selection of partners, formation of families, and thefoundation for the next generation are established. Thus, preven-tion and treatment in adolescence and young adulthood are veryimportant for optimizing life-course development."

Both samples of children completed measures of pre-reading skills, namely phonological awareness, phonological memory, rapid naming, and letter name knowledge, as well as a measure of verbal ability. School entrants also completed measures of letter sound knowledge and beginning word identification skills. Teachers completed rating scales of inattention and hyperactivity. In the preschool sample, teacher-rated inattention and hyperactivity were not correlated with measures of children’s phonological processing but were correlated with letter name knowledge. In comparison, inattention, but not hyperactivity, was independently related to all measures of school entrants’ phonological processing and alphabet knowledge and their knowledge of high frequency words. Structural equation modelling on the school entrant sample revealed that the relationship between inattention and beginning word identification was mediated by pre-reading skills, suggesting that attention problems may compromise reading development during the earliest stages of learning to read through their impact on pre-reading skills. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the consideration of inattention in the design of effective and engaging early childhood learning environments."

Study 1 (n = 416) showed that both level and inconsistency distinguished between the age and 2 cognitive status (not impaired, mildly impaired) groups, with a modest tendency for inconsistency to predict group membership over and above mean level. Study 2 (n = 304) replicated these results but extended them because of the qualifying effects associated with the unique moderately impaired oldest group.

The current issue of growing up bilingually and the connection between reading and writing deficits are also discussed. In conclusion, this paper presents a critical survey of theoretical and practical implications for the diagnostics and treatment of developmental dysgraphia."

Respondents indicated whether they disclosed about each topic, their depth of disclosure, and their motivations for disclosure. Analyses indicate that individuals disclose about fewer topics and do so in less depth to siblings more than 5 years younger than themselves but that there are no differences in disclosure rates or depth to siblings of other ages. Neither participant nor sibling gender significantly affected disclosure rates. Younger siblings reported more disclosure in order to seek advice and emotional support than did older siblings; conversely, older siblings reported more disclosure aimed at teaching younger siblings. Venting was most commonly directed at siblings close in age to oneself. Sisters more often reported disclosing to siblings for the purpose of seeking emotional support than did brothers."

Instead, confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on separate sets of WJ-III correlation matrices, yielding a seven-factor model across all age ranges. To see whether the structure holds for the WJ-III Cognitive, currently recognized best practice exploratory factor analysis (EFA) procedures were applied to two school-aged correlation matrices (ages 9‐13; 14‐19) from the normative sample. Using EFA and higher order factor analysis, four factors emerged at age 9 to 13 and three factors emerged at age 14 to 19. The results of this analysis indicated a robust manifestation of general intelligence (g) that exceeded the variance attributed to the lower order factors. An additional analysis was conducted that disregarded factor extraction rules and forced the seven-factor fit. The resulting solution was only partially aligned (i.e., Gc, Ga, and Gsm) with the theoretical structure posited in the WJ-III Technical Manual. Surprisingly, this study represents the first time to my knowledge that the WJ-III Cognitive has been subjected to EFA analyses given the instrument’s significant use by practitioners and that it has served as the initial evidentiary base for Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory."

Analyses of variance between the groups showed that the RSD and comorbid (RSD + MD) groups were impaired on both alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric RAN, whereas the MD group was impaired only on non-alphanumeric RAN. Furthermore, non-alphanumeric RAN correlated with all measures except spelling, whereas alphanumeric RAN correlated with the reading and spelling measures only.

Experiment 2 demonstrated that anagram solving can increase the proportion of ""old"" judgments relative to words presented outright. Experiment 3 revealed that under certain conditions, solving anagrams influences the proportion of ""old"" judgments to unrelated items immediately following the solved item.

Little is known, however, about the exact form this influence takes, for instance about whether the influence is unsystematic or due to people’s following some rule. Three experiments investigate the descriptive adequacy of a precise proposal to be found in the philosophical literature, to wit, that we should infer to the best explanation, provided certain additional conditions are met. The NA first experiment studies the relation between the quality of an explanation and people’s willingness to infer that explanation when only one candidate explanation is given. The second experiment presents participants always with two explanations and investigates the effect of the presence of an alternative on the participants’ willingness to infer the target explanation. While Experiments 1 and 2 manipulate explanation quality and willingness to infer to the best explanation between participants, Experiment 3 manipulates those measures within participants, thereby allowing to study the influence of explanatory considerations on inference at the individual level. The third experiment also studies the connection between explanation quality, willingness to infer, and metacognitive confidence in the decision to infer. The main conclusions that can be drawn from these experiments are that (i) the quality of an explanation is a good predictor of people’s willingness to accept that explanation, and a better predictor than the prior probability of the explanation, and (ii) if more than one possible explanation is given, people are the less willing to infer the best explanation the better they deem the second-best explanation."

The verbal behaviors examined were speech initiations and total amount of speech; the nonverbal behaviors studied were visual behavior (while speaking and while listening), gesturing, chin thrusts, and smiling. As expected, systematic differences in the behaviors of men and women emerged on the gender-linked tasks. On the masculine task men displayed more verbal and nonverbal power-related behavior than did women. On the feminine task women exhibited more power than men on most of the verbal and nonverbal measures. Also as predicted, on the non-gender-linked task men displayed greater power both verbally and non verbally than did women. There were two exceptions to this overall pattern.

A successful DoG in children/adolescents is subject to the maturation of the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, which is more prone to normal age-related atrophy compared with other brain regions. Therefore, we investigated morphological brain correlates of DoG using structural MRI surface-based morphometry as well as determined whether dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) atrophy is related to DoG in the elderly. We used the behavioral Delay of Gratification Test for Adults to measure DoG in 40 healthy older adults aged between 63 and 93 years. When simultaneously controlling for age and intracranial volume, high DoG significantly positively correlated with cortical surface area of the left DLPFC. At a more liberal statistical threshold, we found positive correlations between DoG and cortical thickness of the left and right DLPFC, left and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and left midanterior cingulate cortex. Additionally, cortical surface area in the left DLPFC correlated positively with DoG as well as with the volume of the left caudate nucleus. The results suggest that the DLPFC, medial prefrontal cortex, and the caudate nucleus play a crucial role in DoG in the elderly supporting studies in related constructs such as delay discounting and impulsivity. Further, the study shows that age-related prefrontal atrophy is associated with DoG performance. The findings are in line with concepts of ""willpower"" that postulate a central role of frontostriatal connectivity in self-regulation and self-control.

Language profiles were also explored. Children with reading difficulties showed weaknesses in phonological awareness and literacy as well as nonphonological oral language skills and nonverbal reasoning. During the intervention, the intervention group made significantly greater progress than the control group in early word reading, phoneme awareness and phonetic spelling. Over a 6-month follow-up period, the intervention group maintained its gains but during this time made significantly less progress on single word reading, phoneme awareness and phonetic spelling than the control group. These findings provide evidence that reading interventions can be delivered effectively in standard educational settings. We argue that a better understanding of how to manage withdrawal of intervention and how to address poor readers’ additional oral language weaknesses is needed."

Young and old adults received extensive practice on a modified version of the Stroop task. Both groups showed reduced interference on the Stroop task with practice. Results suggest that young adults' reduction in Stroop interference was due to general task factors plus the development of a reading suppression response. The old adults' reduction in Stroop interference was attributed primarily to general task factors. Results indicate that old adults have greater difficulty than young adults in developing new automatic processes and modifying existing automatic processes. The implication of these findings for current models of Stroop interference is that, in addition to automatic processing, attentional mechanisms must be incorporated to account for the age-related differences."

This has led to the proposal of the so-called bilingual advantage in inhibitory skills. However, recent studies have cast some doubt on the locus and generality of the alleged bilingual advantage in inhibitory skills. In the current study we investigated inhibitory skills in a large sample of 252 monolingual and 252 bilingual children who were carefully matched on a large number of indices. We tested their performance in a verbal Stroop task and in a nonverbal version of the same task (the number size-congruency task). Results were unequivocal and showed that bilingual and monolingual participants performed equally in these two tasks across all the indices or markers of inhibitory skills explored. Furthermore, the lack of differences between monolingual and bilingual children extended to all the age ranges tested and was not modulated by any of the independent factors investigated. In light of these results, we conclude that bilingual children do not exhibit any specific advantage in simple inhibitory tasks as compared to monolinguals."

More recently, rap lyrics have been introduced by prosecutors to establish guilt in criminal trials. Some fear this form of artistic expression will be inappropriately interpreted as literal and threatening, perhaps because of stereotypes. Only a handful of studies have examined whether rap lyrics are evaluated using stereotypes, yet these studies were conducted in the 1990s — a period of heightened scrutiny for rap — and used nonoptimal methods. This study presents 3 experiments that examine the impact of genre-specific stereotypes on the evaluation of violent song lyrics by manipulating the musical genre (rap vs. country) while holding constant the actual lyrics. Study 1, a direct replication of previous research, found that participants deemed identical lyrics more literal, offensive, and in greater need of regulation when they were characterized as rap compared with country. Study 2 was a conceptual replication (i.e., same design but different stimuli), and again detected this effect. Study 3 used the same approach but experimentally manipulated the race of the author of the lyrics. A main effect was detected for the genre, with rap evaluated more negatively than country or a control condition with no label. However, no effects were found for the race of the lyrics’ author nor were interactions were detected. Collectively, these findings highlight the possibility that rap lyrics could inappropriately impact jurors when admitted as evidence to prove guilt."

Across all 6 studies, the strongest predictors of later achievement are school-entry math, reading, and attention skills. A meta-analysis of the results shows that early math skills have the greatest predictive power, followed by reading and then attention skills. By contrast, measures of socioemotional behaviors, including internalizing and externalizing problems and social skills, were generally insignificant predictors of later academic performance, even among children with relatively high levels of problem behavior.

Specifically, they found that emotions characterized by other-person control (anger and gratitude) and weak control appraisals (happiness) influence trust significantly more than emotions characterized by personal control (pride and guilt) or situational control (sadness). These findings suggest that emotions are more likely to be misattributed when the appraisals of the emotion are consistent with the judgment task than when the appraisals of the emotion are inconsistent with the judgment task.

Prior research suggests that older adults benefit from linguistic prosody when comprehending language but that they have difficulty understanding affective prosody. In a series of 3 experiments, young and older adults listened to sentences in which the emotional cues conveyed by semantic content and affective prosody were either congruent or incongruent and then indicated whether the talker sounded happy or sad. When judging the emotion of the talker, young adults were more attentive to the affective prosodic cues than to the semantic cues, whereas older adults performed less consistently when these cues conflicted. Participants' reading and repetition of the sentences were recorded so that age- and emotion-related changes in the production of emotional speech cues could be examined. Both young and older adults were able to produce affective prosody. The age-related difference in perceiving emotion was eliminated when listeners repeated the sentences before responding, consistent with previous findings regarding the beneficial role of repetition in conversation. The results of these experiments suggest that there are age-related differences in interpreting affective prosody but that repeating may be a compensatory strategy that could minimize the everyday consequences of these differences."

METHOD: Using a concurrent cohort, prospective design, 15 children with severe TBI, 39 with moderate TBI, and 70 with orthopedic injury (OI) who were injured when they were 3-7 years of age were compared on tests of academic achievement and parent and teacher ratings of school performance and behavior on average 6.83 years postinjury. Soon after injury and at the longer term follow-up, families completed measures of parental psychological distress, family functioning, and quality of the home environment. Hierarchical linear regression analyses examined group differences in academic outcomes and their associations with measures of the early and later family environment. RESULTS: The severe TBI group, but not the moderate TBI group, performed worse than did the OI group on all achievement tests, parent ratings of academic performance, and teacher ratings of internalizing problems. Higher quality early and late home environments predicted stronger academic skills and better classroom behavior for children with both TBI and OI. The early family environment more consistently predicted academic achievement, whereas the later family environment more consistently predicted classroom functioning. The quality of the home environment predicted academic outcomes more strongly than did parental psychological distress or family functioning. CONCLUSION: TBI in early childhood has long-term consequences for academic achievement and school performance and behavior. Higher quality early and later home environments predict better school outcomes for both children with TBI and children with OI. (PsycINFO Database Record(c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved).

Although PAD performance was poor in the deaf students compared with RA-matched hearing controls, it nevertheless correlated with their RA. Whether tested in sign or speech, RAN was much faster in the deaf group than in RA-matched hearing controls but showed no direct relationship with reading level or reading delay.

Using breakthroughs in positive psychology, this article proposes a new research agenda focused on the positive, internal states of those with mental retardation. It shows how major movements in the mental retardation field—quality of life, dual diagnosis, personality motivation, and families—have succeeded in some arenas but failed to address happiness and well-being. Examples of happiness—of positive emotions, flow, strengths, and virtues—are offered in people with genetic causes of mental retardation. Complexities related to etiology, measurement, flow, and a meaningful life are described, as is the vital role that mental retardation can play in the emerging science of positive psychology. Mental retardation is a diagnosis based on negatives—on what people do not have. Persons with mental retardation do not have enough IQ points on standardized testing (IQs of 70 or below), and compared with others, they do not have enough everyday adaptive skills. Deficits in IQ and adaptive behavior, along with an age of onset before 18 years, have long constituted the diagnosis of mental retardation (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), with about 2% of the population having mental retardation (see Hodapp & Dykens, 2003). Traditionally, workers in the mental retardation field have focused on the basic, external life conditions of this vulnerable population. Even in today’s age of more enlightened care, history reminds us to remain vigilant in continuing to advocate for programs and legislation that meet the basic human needs of persons with mental retardation. These include food and shelter, as well as access to quality medical care, education, jobs, and inclusive societal opportunities. However, the time is ripe for a shift in both of these emphases. While mental retardation is indeed defined by negatives, and the field caught up with the external, I propose a future research and practice agenda based on positive internal states, including happiness, contentment, hope, engagement, and strengths. In making these conceptual shifts, I turn to recent breakthroughs in mainstream psychology, and show how aspects of positive psychology apply to those with mental retardation. In doing so, I assume that ties between mental retardation and positive psychology are actually a two-way street. Positive psychology benefits those with mental retardation, and this population can uniquely inform positive psychology. Before describing this two-way street, I first need to lay the groundwork that justifies the need for a conceptual shift in the field. This article thus describes the historical and current focus on external conditions in the mental retardation field. I then describe how four major movements in mental retardation have excelled in some arenas but fallen short in addressing happiness and well-being. Finally, I offer several examples that demonstrate how persons with mental retardation embody aspects of positive psychology."

Experiments 2 and 3 addressed the possibility that incidental exposure to perceptually similar native language speech sounds during the day interfered with maintenance in the morning group.

Studies reporting no effect typically involved participants listening to audio recordings of hetero-hypnosis only. Meta- analysis revealed a medium-to-large effect size for self-hypnosis in clinical treatment."

Participants were 243 Mexican American youth (mean age: 13.7 years; 62% girls), or 121 youth who had a pregnant adolescent sister and 122 youth who had an adolescent sister who had never been pregnant. Youth and their mothers were studied at 4 time points across 15 months: The families of pregnant adolescents were studied when the adolescent sister was in her third trimester of pregnancy, and at 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months postpartum; the families of never-pregnant adolescents were studied at like intervals. Individual fixed-effects structural equation models were computed, which control for earlier measures of study constructs and thereby reduce omitted variable bias from preexisting family group differences. Results showed that an adolescent’s childbearing was related to increases in family stress, which were related to increases in mothers’ harsh parenting and mother–sibling conflict, which, in turn, were related to subsequent increases in siblings’ problem behavior. Multiple group analyses revealed that the pathways through which a teenager’s childbearing influences siblings operate similarly for girls and boys. Tests of an alternate ordering of model variables indicated a poor fit with the data. Findings provide evidence that the accumulation of stressful family changes following an adolescent’s childbearing can negatively impact siblings. Findings also elucidate how family-level stress and disruption experienced across a family transition trickle down to affect family relationships and, in turn, child family members."

Thirty children in the most mature RS quartile and 30 in the least mature quartile completed 3 reaction time tasks used by S. Hale (1990).

In English, the major agreement controller is the sentence subject, the major agreement targets are verbs and pronouns, and the major agreement category is number. The authors expand an account of number agreement whose tenets are that pronouns acquire number lexically, whereas verbs acquire it syntactically but with similar contributions from number meaning and from the number morphology of agreement controllers. These tenets were instantiated in a model using existing verb agreement data. The model was then fit to a new, more extensive set of verb data and tested with a parallel set of pronoun data. The theory was supported by the model's outcomes. The results have implications for the integration of words and structures, for the workings of agreement categories, and for the nature of the transition from thought to language."

While a small subset of BPS cases have been described as having relatively isolated language delays (Leventer et al., 2010), BPS is not expected in children with dyslexia. As part of a Medical University of South Carolina, IRB approved multi-site study involving retrospective and de-identified dyslexia data, we unexpectedly identified a 14.05 year old male with evidence of BPS whose father had been diagnosed with dyslexia and dysgraphia. This child had been recruited for a neuroimaging study on dyslexia from a school specializing in educating children with dyslexia. The T1-weighted MRI scan from this child demonstrated a highly unusual perisylvian sulcal/gyral patterning that is a defining feature of BPS (Fig. 1). BPS cases exhibit bilateral dysgenesis of the Sylvian fissure and surrounding gyri, which appears to occur because of a limited or absent arcuate fasciculus (Kilinc, Ekinci, Demirkol, & Agan, 2015). This BPS case also had a relatively enlarged atrium of the lateral ventricle that is consistent with the BPS anatomical presentation and reduction of parietal white matter (Graff-Radford et al., 1986, Kilinc et al., 2015 and Toldo et al., 2011)."

VBM demonstrated significant gray and white matter differences in these three brain regions. In contrast to the manual results, these differences were not significant after controlling for brain volume, suggesting the manual measures captured additional important variance that distinguished the groups. Post-hoc VBM comparisons demonstrated white matter volume differences in a left temporal-parietal region that are consistent in location with results from diffusion tensor imaging studies of dyslexia. The VBM analyses also identified, gray matter volume differences in the left and right lingual gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule and cerebellum, areas that had not been examined with manual methods.

The idea that people are unable to evaluate evidence independently of prior beliefs has been documented elsewhere, including in the classic study by C. G. Lord, L. Ross, and M. R. Lepper (1979). The present findings contribute to this literature by specifying the processes by which prior beliefs affect the evaluation of evidence. The authors compare the disconflrmation model to several other models of how prior beliefs influence current judgments and present data that provide support for the disconfirmation model. Results indicate that whether a person's prior belief is accompanied by emotional conviction affects the magnitude and form of the disconfirmation bias. When evaluating an argument, can one assess its strength independently of one's prior belief in the conclusion? A good deal of evidence indicates the answer is an emphatic no (e.g., Batson, 1975; Chapman & Chapman, 1959; Darley & Gross, 1983; Geller & Pitz, 1968; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Sherif & Hovland, 1961). This phenomenon, which we refer to as the prior belief effect, has important implications. Given two people, or groups, with opposing beliefs about a social, political, or scientific issue, the degree to which they will view relevant evidence as strong will differ. This difference, in turn, may result in a failure of the opposing parties to converge on any kind of meaningful agreement, and, under some circumstances, they may become more extreme in their beliefs. Perhaps the most renowned study documenting the prior belief effect is one conducted by Lord, Ross, and Lepper (1979); this study served as the starting point for our work.

CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1976, 47, 502-505. Children and adult reader.s were asked to label 2 sets of pictures, 1 drawti with either eorrect word labels or diserepaiit labels, and the other with no labels (control condition). Results supported previous conclusions that discrepant words interfere with picture-naming speed and congruent words enhance speed. Interference was evident in all subjects except a group of below-average second-grade readers, apparently because it took them as long to recognize the words as to name the pictures. In a recent issue of Child Development, Rosinski, Golinkoff, and Kukish (1975) describe a most interesting phenomenon evident in the performances of second- as well a.s sixth-grade readers and adults, a phenomenon resembling the Stroop color-word interference effect (Stroop 1935). In this study, stibjects were asked to label drawings of 20 familiar objects arranged in five rows on a sheet of paper. Printed in the middle of each object was a word. In the 100% congruence condition, idl the words correctly labeled the pictures. In the 0% congruence condition, none of the words matched. The subjects were told to ignore the words as they named the pictures. The time taken to identify all 20 pictures was recorded. Results revealed that it took subjects much longer to label pictures with discrepant labels than with correct labels. Furthermore, differencjes between the discrepant and congruent conditions were greater among younger than older subjects. In a second experiment, another condition was added, one in which nonsense trigrams rhyming with the correct labels served as the printed distractors. Findings indicated that subjects took less time to label pictures with trigrams than pictures with discrepant: words, but they took substantially longer in the trigram condition than in the congrttent word condition. Rosinski et al. conclude that picturelabeling behavior is influenced by the presence of printed words and that the presence of discrepant words has the effect of interfering with pieturelabeling performance, especially among younger subjects."

In support of this observation, manipulating people’s general views of their ability, or altering which view seemed most relevant to a task, changed performance estimates independently of any impact on actual performance. A final study extended this analysis to why women disproportionately avoid careers in science. Women performed equally to men on a science quiz, yet underestimated their performance because they thought less of their general scientific reasoning ability than did men. They, consequently, were more likely to refuse to enter a science competition. How’m I doin’? Ed Koch, Mayor of New York City, 1978 –1989 The knowledge of whether one is succeeding or failing at a task can be a precious piece of information. The degree to which individuals think that they performed well often has substantial consequences for the actions they take and the outcomes they encounter. A young person’s impression of how well he or she did on a first date can determine if he or she pursues the relationship. A law student’s impression of how well he has answered practice questions for a bar exam will determine whether he continues to study. A young actor’s impression of her performance in the latest community play may determine whether she decides to hop on the next bus to Hollywood rather than enroll in the local college. Thus, much like Ed Koch did during his 12 years as mayor of New York City, people frequently ask and reflect on how they are doing at a particular task. However, gaining accurate insight into one’s performance can be an elusive goal. Abstract beliefs about one’s ability, as well as"

It is argued that many real-world processes are perceived to be ambiguous; moreover, as Ellsberg demonstrated, this poses problems for theories of probability operationalized via choices amongst gambles. A descriptive model of how people make judgments under ambiguity in tasks where data come from a source of limited, but not exactly known reliability, is proposed. The model assumes an anchoring-and-adjustment process in which data provides the anchor, and adjustments are made for what might have been. The latter is modeled as the result of a mental simulation process that incorporates the unreliability of the source and one's attitude toward ambiguity in the circumstances. A two-parameter model of this process is shown to be consistent with: Keynes' idea of the weight of evidence, the non-additivity of complementary probabilities, current psychological theories of risk, and Ellsberg's original paradox. The model is tested in four experiments at both the individual and group levels. In experiments 1-3, the model is shown to predict judgments quite well; in experiment 4, the inference model is shown to predict choices between gambles. The results and model are then discussed with respect to the importance of ambiguity in assessing perceived uncertainty; the use of cognitive strategies in judgments under ambiguity; the role of ambiguity in risky choice; and extensions of the model.

We first examined the reading outcome of 198 children in four developmental cognitive subgroups that were identified in our previous analysis: dysfluent trajectory, declining trajectory, unexpected trajectory and typical trajectory. We found that RD was unevenly distributed among the subgroups, although children with RD were found in all subgroups. A majority of the children with RD had familial risk for dyslexia. Second, we examined in what respect children with similar early cognitive development but different RD outcome differ from each other in cognitive skills, task-focused behaviour and print exposure. The comparison of the groups with high cognitive risk but different RD outcome showed significant differences in phonological skills, in the amount of shared reading and in task-focused behaviour. Children who ended up with RD despite low early cognitive risk had poorer cognitive skills, more task avoidance and they were reading less than children without RD and low cognitive risk. In summary, lack of task avoidance seemed to act as a protective factor, which underlines the importance of keeping children interested in school work and reading.

Family-risk had a significant effect on early language and pre-literacy skills, reading fluency and PISA reading. A similar model predicting PISA reading fitted the data well in the Family-risk and the No family-risk group. Language skills explained a good portion and pre-literacy skills to a lesser extent the variance in PISA reading. Altogether 68% of the variance in PISA reading was explained in the Family-risk group and 44% in the No family-risk group.

When that single item is removed, the significant predictors are age of acquisition (AoA), word frequency, regularity, and length. Analyses of the combined data from J. Monaghan and A. W.

Monaghan and Ellis (2002) sought to test some predictions and clarify some assertions concerning the impact of spelling-sound consistency on word naming. Some of Monaghan and Ellis's observations were of relevance to a study by Strain, Patterson, and Seidenberg (1995), who suggested that consistency, or regularity (we shall regard the two as interchangeable for present purposes), interacts with imageability such that the reading of low-frequency exception words is affected by imageability more than is the reading of low-frequency regular words. By the end of their own investigations, Monaghan and Ellis were less sanguine. Monaghan and Ellis took a factorial approach to exploring interactions, ma- nipulating spelling-sound consistency plus one other factor in each experiment (word frequency in Experiment 1, age of acquisition (AoA) in Experiment 2, and imageability in Experiment 3). Con- sistency interacted with frequency and AoA, but no interaction between consistency and imageability comparable to that claimed by Strain et al. (1995) was found.

According to the presence and absence of these vowel diacritics, the Arabic script can be considered more or less transparent in comparison with other orthographies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of working memory to vowelized and non-vowelized reading comprehension and determine whether working memory is more involved in non-vowelized than vowelized reading comprehension. Forty-nine Arabic speaking children from grade six (age 11) undertook two measures of reading comprehension (one vowelized and one non-vowelized). They were also given measures of word reading fluency, vocabulary, phonological awareness, rapid naming and listening span as a measure of working memory. The results indicated that both vowelized and non-vowelized texts were associated with the measure of working memory after controlling for vocabulary, word reading and phonological processing. Although the results are more consistent with common influences of working memory across the two orthographies, slightly larger effects of working memory on non-vowelized reading comprehension suggest that further research, potentially with younger cohorts of Arabic readers would be appropriate.

We meta-analyzed 2 major international data sets, the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and the Programme for International Student Assessment, representing 493,495 students 14-16 years of age, to estimate the magnitude of gender differences in mathematics achievement, attitudes, and affect across 69 nations throughout the world. Consistent with the gender similarities hypothesis, all of the mean effect sizes in mathematics achievement were very small (d < 0.15); however, national effect sizes showed considerable variability (ds = -0.42 to 0.40). Despite gender similarities in achievement, boys reported more positive math attitudes and affect (ds = 0.10 to 0.33); national effect sizes ranged from d = -0.61 to 0.89. In contrast to those of previous tests of the gender stratification hypothesis, our results point to specific domains of gender equity responsible for gender gaps in math. Gender equity in school enrollment, women's share of research jobs, and women's parliamentary representation were the most powerful predictors of cross-national variability in gender gaps in math. Results are situated within the context of existing research demonstrating apparently paradoxical effects of societal gender equity and highlight the significance of increasing girls' and women's agency cross-nationally."

Further, working memory deficits are suspected in ADHD, yet their distinction from cognitive inhibition is unclear. Two hundred and eighty-eight adolescent and adult participants, 115 of whom met criteria for ADHD and 173 of whom were for non-ADHD comparison, completed a sentence processing task that required the suppression of an incorrect interpretation and a working memory task. The results failed to support cognitive inhibition problems in ADHD. Moreover, the ability to reanalyze sentences with a temporary misinterpretation was at least partially related to working memory performance. The results challenge a unitary inhibition problem in ADHD and suggest inhibition problems do not extend to cognitive suppression in this age range."

We extended existing models with a perspective from achievement motivation theory and additionally used achievement primes embedded in the running text of excerpts of school textbooks to simulate a more natural priming condition. Specifically, we proposed that achievement primes affect implicit achievement motivation and conducted pilot experiments and 3 main experiments to explore this proposition. We found no reliable positive effect of achievement primes on implicit achievement motivation. In light of these findings, we tested whether explicit (instead of implicit) achievement motivation is affected by achievement primes and found this to be the case. In the final experiment, we found support for the assumption that higher explicit achievement motivation implies that achievement priming affects the outcome expectations. The implications of the results are discussed, and we conclude that primes affect achievement behavior by heightening explicit achievement motivation and outcome expectancies."

The authors hypothesized that women with the stress of having a family history of breast cancer (FH+) would exhibit greater interference on a task with cancer-related stimuli than women without cancer in the family (FH-). The authors developed a modified Stroop color-naming task to test this hypothesis in a sample of FH+ (n = 72) and FH- (n = 96) women. Consistent with the hypotheses, FH+ women had longer color-naming times and more errors (ps <.01) on a cancer word list relative to noncancer lists. This biased processing was not mediated by the significantly higher perceived risk, general distress, or cancer-specific distress in FH+ women. Maladaptive alterations in processing cancer stimuli may have important clinical implications, as these women must process complex cancer-related information critical to their health (e.g., options for chemoprevention, screening)."

Less well-known clinical and laboratory traditions suggest, however, that memory can also increase over time. Ballard (1913) demonstrated that, actually, memory simultaneously increases and decreases over time and thus has not 1 but 2 tendencies. When more than 1 recall test is administered, a later test invariably shows loss of some items remembered earlier (oblivescence), but later tests also invariably show that previously unremembered items are recovered in later tests (reminis- cence). Depending on a number of factors (e.g., the stimulus used), the overall balance between reminiscence and oblivescence may be positive (hypermnesia) or negative (amnesia). Modern multitrial recall studies have extensively documented hypermnesic memory in single laboratory sessions and, also, although less frequently, over pe- riods of days, weeks, and even months. With hypermnesic memory now established, hypnosis has been shown not to add anything to regular hypermnesia. This article presents an integration of the scattered literatures, which now, after a century of experimental and clinical effort, coheres into a solid empirical picture, with numerous implications (e.g., for the recovered memory controversy, eyewitness testimony, repression, and subliminal perception)."

Analyses of the kindergarten predictor scores revealed distinct underlying components, one related to reading and one to oral language. Further analyses revealed that phonological awareness, phonological access, and letter-sound knowledge in L1 were significant predictors of risk for reading difficulties in L2 while performance on L1 sentence repetition, phonological awareness, and tense marking tests in kindergarten were the best predictors of risk for L1 and L2 oral language difficulties. Both fall- and spring-kindergarten predictors predicted Grade 1 outcomes to a significant extent, with the spring-kindergarten predictors being more accurate.

The present study further tests this hypothesis by investigating structural abnormalities using voxel-based morphometry in a sample of incarcerated men (N = 296). Psychopathy was associated with decreased regional gray matter in several paralimbic and limbic areas, including bilateral parahippocampal, amygdala, and hippocampal regions, bilateral temporal pole, posterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex.

The MSCEIT is a well-validated ability-based EI measure that does not rely on self-report judgments of emotional skills. The Hare PCL-R is the gold standard for the assessment of psychopathy in clinical populations. Controlling for general intelligence, psychopathy was associated with lower EI.

In the current investigation, we examined whether psychologically “wise” interventions targeting expectancies and values—stock antecedents of ordinary effortful behaviors—could motivate nonexperts to engage in deliberate practice and improve their achievement. As a preliminary, we developed and validated a novel task measure of deliberate practice and confirmed its association with (a) expectancy-value beliefs, and (b) achievement in the nonexpert setting (Study 1). Next, across 4 longitudinal, randomized-controlled, field experiments, we intervened. Among lower-achievers, wise deliberate practice interventions improved math performance for 5th and 6th graders (Study 2), end-of-semester grades for undergraduates (Study 3), and end-of-quarter grades for 6th graders (Study 4); the same pattern of results emerged in end-of-quarter grades for 7th graders (Study 5). Following the intervention, expectancy-value beliefs and deliberate practice improved for 1 month (Study 4), but not 4 (Study 5). Treatment proved beneficial over and above 2 control conditions: 1 that taught standard study skills (Studies 2 and 3), and 1 that discussed deep interests, generalized motivation, and high achievement (Studies 4 and 5). Collectively, these findings provide preliminary support for the heretofore untested hypothesis that deliberate practice submits to the same laws that govern typical forms of effortful behavior, and that wise interventions that tap into these laws can spur short-term gains in adaptive beliefs, deliberate practice, and objectively measured achievement.

Surprisingly, few studies have investigated how these biases operate among children, despite the theoretical importance of understanding when these biases emerge in development. Here, we used an economic trust game to systematically investigate trust behavior in young children (5-8 years), older children (9-12 years) and adults. Participants played the game with child and adult ‘partners’ that varied in emotional expression (mild displays of happiness and anger, and a neutral baseline), which is known to modulate perceived trustworthiness. Strikingly, both groups of children showed adult-like facial appearance biases when trusting others, with no ‘own-age bias’. There were no developmental differences in the magnitude of this effect, which supports adult-like overgeneralisation of these transient emotion cues into enduring trait impressions that guide interpersonal behavior from as early as 5 years of age. Irrespective of whether or not they were explicitly directed to do so, all participants modulated their behavior in line with the emotion cues: more generous/trusting with happy partners, followed by neutral and then angry. These findings speak to the impressive sophistication of children’s early social cognition and provide key insights into the causal mechanisms driving trait impressions, suggesting they are not necessarily contingent upon protracted social experience."

This study set out to determine whether the variable amount of exposure to such patterns leads to individual differences in reading behaviour as measured via eye-movements. Previous studies have demonstrated that more proficient readers are less influenced by distributional biases in language (e.g. frequency, predictability, transitional probability) than poor readers. We hypothesized that a probabilistic bias that is characteristic of written but not spoken language would preferentially affect readers with greater exposure to printed materials in general and to the specific pattern engendering the bias. Readers of varying reading experience were presented with sentences including English compound words that can occur in two spelling formats with differing probabilities: concatenated (windowsill, used 40% of the time) or spaced (window sill, 60%). Linear mixed effects multiple regression models fitted to the eye-movement measures showed that the probabilistic bias towards the presented spelling had a stronger facilitatory effect on compounds that occurred more frequently (in any spelling) or belonged to larger morphological families, and on readers with higher scores on a test of exposure-to-print. Thus, the amount of support towards the compound’s spelling is effectively exploited when reading, but only when the spelling patterns are entrenched in an individual’s mental lexicon via overall exposure to print and to compounds with alternating spelling. We argue that research on the interplay of language use and structure is incomplete without proper characterization of how particular individuals, with varying levels of experience and skill, learn these language structures."

We monitored eye movements while participants read phonologically typical and atypical nouns in noun-predictive contexts (Experiment 1), demonstrating that when a noun is strongly expected, fixation durations on first-pass eye movement measures, including first fixation duration, gaze duration, and go-past times, are shorter for nouns with category typical form-based features.

The participants were 392 primarily Latino immigrant (85%) families and their children. Mothers completed questionnaires about their families and their home literacy environment (HLE), and children's emergent literacy skills were measured in English and Spanish at the outset of the preschool year. Project assistants interviewed mothers in their homes and tallied the presence of literacy-related materials. Results of structural equation modeling showed that the 3 preliteracy skills were significantly associated within and across English and Spanish, suggesting the possible transfer of these early preliteracy skills across languages. For the English language HLE, parents' literacy-related behaviors, sibling-child reading, and families' literacy resources were all associated with children's English oral language skills, and their English print knowledge was associated with their home resources. For the Spanish language HLE, only parents' literacy-related behaviors were related to children's Spanish oral language and print knowledge skills. There were no significant cross-linguistic relations between any aspect of the English HLE and children's Spanish preliteracy skills, whereas parents' literacy-related behaviors in Spanish were negatively associated with children's English oral language and phonological awareness skills. Given the importance of oral language and vocabulary in promoting children's literacy, these results indicate that parents can support this skill in both languages, but their relative impact seems to be within rather across language."

A variety of factors, both cognitive and affective, predicted participants’ moralization or lack thereof. Model testing further pointed to two primary conduits of moralization: the experience of moral emotions (e.g., disgust, guilt) felt when contemplating the issue, and moral piggybacking (connecting the issue at hand with one’s existing fundamental moral principles). Moreover, we found individual differences, such as how much one holds their morality as central to their identity, also predicted the moralization process.

Little is known, however, about how and why people share reputational information. Here, we seek to establish the existence and dynamics of prosocial gossip, the sharing of negative evaluative information about a target in a way that protects others from antisocial or exploitative behavior. We present a model of prosocial gossip and the results of 4 studies testing the model's claims. Results of Studies 1 through 3 demonstrate that (a) individuals who observe an antisocial act experience negative affect and are compelled to share information about the antisocial actor with a potentially vulnerable person, (b) sharing such information reduces negative affect created by observing the antisocial behavior, and (c) individuals possessing more prosocial orientations are the most motivated to engage in such gossip, even at a personal cost, and exhibit the greatest reduction in negative affect as a result. Study 4 demonstrates that prosocial gossip can effectively deter selfishness and promote cooperation. Taken together these results highlight the roles of prosocial motivations and negative affective reactions to injustice in maintaining reputational information sharing in groups. We conclude by discussing implications for reputational theories of the maintenance of cooperation in human groups."

Phonological ambiguity was produced by using letter strings that, when transcribed in Roman or when transcribed in Cyrillic, contained one or more ambiguous characters. Ambiguous characters are those letters shared by the two alphabets that receive different phonemic interpretations in the two alphabets. The controls for phonologically ambiguous words were the same words in their alternative, nonambiguous alphabetic transcription. Consistent with previous experiments on adults, the phonologically ambiguous form of a word or pseudoword was named much more slowly than the phonologically unambiguous form. For children who were equally proficient in both Roman and Cyrillic, the effect of phonological ambiguity was greater as children named letter strings faster. If it can be assumed that reading fluency correlates with naming latency, then it can be argued that the better beginning reader is more phonologically analytic."

It is not known whether PNH-related reading difficulty can be detected earlier in childhood or whether associated behavioral problems are present. We studied 10 children with PNH, 3 of whom did not have seizures, and 10 matched controls with neuropsychological testing and parental rating instruments at two time points separated by about 1 year. Children with PNH performed significantly worse than controls on a task related to reading fluency. In addition, those with PNH showed significantly worse adaptive skills, and a measure of conduct problems significantly worsened over time. Mood and behavioral problems were reported more commonly, though not significantly so, in children with PNH. These findings demonstrate that reading dysfluency can be evident in children with nodular heterotopia, even in the absence of epilepsy, but also highlight difficulties with behavior in this population."

Reading skill was measured in third grade with a group-administered achievement test (vocabulary and comprehension), and children were classified as severely disabled, poor, average, or superior readers. Of the 19 possible kindergarten predictors, only rapid naming of letters, general ability, and discrimination of beginning sounds within words significantly contributed to the prediction of reading outcome. With general ability removed from the analysis, rapid letter naming, beginning sound discrimination, and auditory conceptualization predicted reading outcome.

However, after covarying for intelligence and socioeconomic status, only tests of rapid naming, phonological awareness, and nonword reading were significant discriminating measures.

Incongruent trials led to task-specific reduction of conflict (trial n 2) without cross-task modulation (trial n 1), but this was fully explained by repetition priming. In contrast, an increased ratio of incongruent words did lead to sustained task-specific enhancement, above and beyond repetition priming (Experiment 2). Experiments 3 and 4 assessed the voluntary modulation of cognitive control: A cue predicted the congruency of the incoming trial, allowing participants to establish the correct mindset (Word Stroop in Experiment 3, Flanker task in Experiment 4). Preparing oneself to process an incongruent word (or flanker) enhanced conflict resolution in the subsequent Number Stroop, an example of cross-task modulation.

Structural inferences from local computations make minimal demands on memory, require relatively small amounts of data, and need not respect normative prescriptions as inferences that are principled locally may violate those principles when combined. Over a series of 3 experiments, the authors found (a) systematic inferences from small amounts of data; (b) systematic inference of extraneous causal links; (c) influence of data presentation order on inferences; and (d) error reduction through pretraining.

There are normative sources of support for this theory, but individual differences have received scant attention. This is surprising because people are likely to differ in the frequency with which they use metaphors and, therefore, the frequency with which they experience the costs and benefits of metaphoric thinking. To investigate these ideas, a 5-study program of research (total N = 532) was conducted. Study 1 developed and validated a Metaphor Usage Measure (MUM), finding that people were fairly consistent in their tendencies toward literal thought and language on the one hand versus metaphoric thought and language on the other. These differences were, in turn, consequential. Although metaphor usage predicted susceptibility to metaphor transfer effects (Studies 2 and 3), it was also linked to higher levels of emotional understanding (Studies 4 and 5). The findings provide support for several key premises of conceptual metaphor theory in the context of a new measure that can be used to track the consequences of metaphoric thinking.

In the manual response modality, they found that masked incongruent primes produced interference relative to both congruent and neutral primes. This finding, which replicates the standard finding in the masked congruence priming literature, is presumed to reflect the conflict that arises between two incompatible responses and, thus, to index the extent of processing of the masked prime. Somewhat surprisingly, when participants were asked to respond verbally in the same task, masked incongruent primes no longer produced interference, but masked congruent primes produced facilitation. These findings are surprising because they suggest that the processing of nonconsciously perceived primes extends to the response level in the manual, but not verbal, response modality. The authors propose that the modulation of the masked congruence priming effect by response modality is due to verbal, but not manual, responses being mediated by the lexical–phonological production system."

Nine text characteristics were most important for early-grades text complexity including word structure (decoding demand and number of syllables in words), word meaning (age of acquisition, abstractness, and word rareness), and sentence and discourse-level characteristics (intersentential complexity, phrase diversity, text density/information load, and noncompressibility).

This suggests that predictability can impact the decision of whether to skip a word to a similar degree irrespective of whether the predictability originated from the prior word or the entire preceding sentence context.

Qualitative data suggested that people tend to pursue different interpersonal goals within different types of relationships (e.g., mother, best friend, coworker). In several studies, priming participants’ relationship representations produced goal-directed behavior (achievement, helping, understanding) in line with the previously assessed goal content of those representations. These findings support the hypothesis that interpersonal goals are component features of relationship representations and that mere activation of those representations, even in the partner’s physical absence, causes the goals to become active and to guide behavior nonconsciously within the current situation. Many of people’s most strongly held goals, fears, and desires spring from their ongoing close relationships. Friends, family members, colleagues, and romantic partners are those whom people try hardest to understand, to whom they wish to grow closer, and from whom they seek to gain approval. Relationship partners are the elicitors of strong and influential motivations—motivations that alter people’s perceptions, change their emotions, and guide their behavior. Given the importance of such motivational forces in daily life, it is essential that we understand the process by which relationship partners evoke these powerful goals. Theorists have suggested that interpersonal goals exist as component features of the cognitive representations of relationship partners (Miller & Read, 1991; Shah, Kruglanski, & Friedman, in press).

Some of the largest gains occur on culturally reduced tests and tests of fluid intelligence. The Norwegian data show that a nation can make significant gains on a culturally reduced test while suffering losses on other tests. The Dutch data prove the existence of unknown environmental factors so potent that they account for 15 of the 20 points gained. The hypothesis that best fits the results is that IQ tests do not measure intelligence but rather a correlate with a weak causal link to intelligence. This hypothesis can also explain differential trends on various mental tests, such as the combination of IQ gains and Scholastic Aptitude Test losses in the United States. Over the last decade, scholars in many countries—largely unknown to one another—have been measuring IQ trends from one generation to the next. In this article their results are collected and analyzed so as to reap the benefits comparative data usually yield. It is also argued that this mass of data poses fundamental problems for developmental psychology, primarily concerning what factors have the most potent effect on IQ, what IQ tests measure, and how IQ tests should be used in making between-groups comparisons."

Salivary cortisol was assessed at 5 times, and self-reported cognitive and affective responses were assessed. Compared with those with high self-esteem, individuals with low self-esteem responded to rejection by appraising themselves more negatively, making more self-blaming attributions, exhibiting greater cortisol reactivity, and derogating the rejector. Path analysis indicated that the link between low self-esteem and increased cortisol reactivity was mediated by self-blame attributions; cortisol reactivity, in turn, mediated the link between low self-esteem and increased partner derogation.

In this study of 4- to 6-year-olds, we examine whether aspects of the home literacy environment are differentially associated with phonological awareness. Parental responses to a questionnaire about the home literacy environment are compared to children's awareness of rhyme and phonemes, as well as to their vocabulary, letter knowledge, and performance on measures of phonological strength (nonword repetition, rapid naming skill, phonological distinctness, and auditory discrimination). The results showed that a teaching focus in the home literacy environment and exposure to reading-related media are directly associated with phoneme awareness and indirectly associated via letter knowledge and vocabulary.

Four repetition-priming experiments with Spanish― English bilinguals (N = 274) decomposed these processes using selective facilitation to evaluate their unique priming contributions and factorial combination to evaluate the degree of process overlap or dependence. In Experiment 1, symmetric priming between semantic classification and translation tasks indicated that bilinguals do not covertly translate words during semantic classification. In Experiments 2 and 3, semantic classification of words and word-cued picture drawing facilitated word-comprehension processes of translation, and picture naming facilitated word-production processes. These effects were independent, consistent with a sequential model and with the conclusion that neither semantic classification nor word-cued picture drawing elicits covert translation.

Incomplete transfer from written translation to spoken translation indicated that preparation for articulation also benefited from repetition in the less-fluent language."

Both naive and expert independent raters given descriptions of the study made predictions that conformed to previous emotion-based accounts of faces but departed from the findings. The results suggest that some solitary faces may be implicitly social, a view consistent with both contemporary ethology, and role and impression-management theories of behavior. People make faces when they are alone. This curious fact may have been crucial in shaping the most popular contemporary theories of facial expression.

Yet, anecdotally, teachers and students consider seductive details an enhancement to classroom lectures. We examined this apparent disconnect by exploring the impact of seductive details in mathematics lecture learning as a function of prior knowledge across 2 affective contexts: low-stakes learning and high-stakes learning. Undergraduate students viewed a video lecture on matrix algebra with or without seductive details either in a low-stakes or high-stakes learning environment. The high stakes were designed to mimic common classroom accountability for learning and were removed prior to the final test. On the final test, seductive details were generally detrimental in the low-stakes, but not high-stakes, learning environment. However, this effect was moderated by students’ prior knowledge. Students with higher prior knowledge were not impacted by seductive details in either high- or low-stakes learning environments. In contrast, students with lower prior knowledge—those most in need of pedagogical assistance—learned more when seductive details were included in a high-stakes lecture environment. These results suggest that seductive details may not be as detrimental as previously concluded, and may even be beneficial in an incentivized learning environment for students who have the most to learn.

However, the Montagu Principle may not apply in a hyper-partisan political environment in which politicians “throw red meat to their base” by unleashing uncivil, personal attacks against their opponents, satisfying the aggressive desires of their most hyper-partisan supporters, and thus potentially redoubling their approval among them. We conducted 2 longitudinal/observational studies of U.S. Congress and President Trump, and 4 experiments (N = 4,837) involving real exchanges between President Trump and his adversaries and a speech by a fictitious politician. Civility helped or did not affect—but never harmed—the reputation of the speaker, supporting the Montagu Principle. Even self-identified “diehard supporters” of President Trump, for example, evaluated the president more favorably after he responded with civility to a personal attack. Uncivil remarks uniquely diminished the speaker’s reputation, and had little impact on the reputation of the targets of the attack, the perceived winner of the verbal exchange, the reputation of the speaker’s party, or the sense that the country is moving in the right direction. Incivility made the speaker seem less warm and did less to affect perceptions of dominance or honesty. This warmth deficit explained the reputational costs of incivility.

However, further analyses suggested that the transitional probability effect was likely due to differences in predictability rather than transitional probability. Experiment 2, using a better controlled set of items, again showed an effect of predictability, but no effect of transitional probability.

Experiments 1 and 2 revealed larger frequency effects and larger semantic priming effects in naming with unpointed print than with pointed print. In Experiments 3 and 4, subjects were presented with Hebrew consonantal strings that were followed by vowel marks appearing at stimulus onset asynchronies ranging from 0 ms (simultaneous presentation) to 300 ms from the onset of consonant presentation. Subjects were inclined to wait for the vowel marks to appear even though the words could be named unequivocally using lexical phonology. These results suggested that prelexical phonology was the default strategy for readers in shallow orthographies, providing strong support for the ODH. Most early studies of visual word recognition were carried out in the English language. This state of affairs was partly due to an underlying belief that reading processes (as well as other cognitive processes) are universal, and therefore studies in English are sufficient to provide a complete account of the processes involved in recognizing printed words. In the last decade, however, studies in orthographies other than English have become more and more prevalent. These studies have in common the view that reading processes cannot be explained without considering the reader's linguistic environment in general, and the characteristics of his or her writing system in particular. Various writing system have evolved over time in different cultures. These writing systems, whether logographic, syllabic, or alphabetic, typically reflect the language's unique phonology and morphology, representing them in an effective way (Mattingly, 1992; Scheerer, 1986).

This effect was only moderate in English and nonsignificant in SerboCroatian (the shallowest of the three orthographies). Moreover, only in Hebrew did lexical status have similar effects on naming and lexical decision performance. Experiment 2 revealed that semantic priming effects in naming were larger in Hebrew than in English and completely absent in SerboCroatian. Experiment 3 revealed that a large proportion of nonlexical tokens (nonwords) in the stimulus list affects naming words in Hebrew and in English, but not in Serbo-Croatian.

The relationship between structural measures and birth risk, hemisphere, and cognitive ability (attention, lexical and sublexical decoding, auditory phonological awareness, and processing speed) were analysed using mixed-model regression.



Results  Left-hemisphere superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity were linked to reading-related skills (fractional anisotropy vs letter–word identification, r(30)=−0.37, p<0.05; fractional anisotropy vs phoneme reversal, r(30)=−0.34, p=0.05; radial diffusivity vs letter–word identification, r(30)=0.31, p<0.10; radial diffusivity vs phoneme reversal, r(30)=0.40, p<0.05), whereas right-hemisphere SLF fractional anisotropy was related to attention skills (fractional anisotropy vs inattentiveness, r(30)=−0.38, p<0.05). SLF volume decreased as these skills declined for adolescents born preterm (volume vs phoneme reversal, r(17)=0.58, p<0.01; volume vs inattentiveness, r(17)=−0.69, p<0.01), but not for those born at term.



Interpretation  The relationship between cognitive skills and SLF volume suggests that in adolescents born preterm, cryptic white-matter injury may exist, possibly related to oligodendrocyte or axonal loss, despite normal clinical neuroimaging."

We examine differences in CC splenium microstructure and the association of splenium microstructure with reading related skills. Nine DRs and eighteen TRs completed a reading skills battery and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DRs had higher splenium fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (LA) as compared to TRs. Retrieval of orthographic information from the language lexicon was negatively associated with FA and LA within both reading groups. Phonological awareness was positively associated with splenium FA and LA in TDs but not DRs. This study suggests two white matter pathways that may be differentially associated with reading skills in the CC splenium.

Then, students were assessed on word-problem measures proximal and distal to instruction. Structural equation measurement models showed that DA measured a distinct dimension of pretreatment ability and that proximal and distal word-problem measures were needed to account for outcome. Structural equation modeling showed that instruction (conventional vs. validated) and pretreatment calculation skills were sufficient to account for math word-problem outcome proximal to instruction; by contrast, language, pretreatment word-problem skill, and DA were needed to forecast learning on word-problem outcomes more distal to instruction.

Development was indexed via latent change scores, and the interplay between numerical and domain-general abilities was analyzed via multiple regression. Results suggest that the development of different types of formal school mathematics depends on different constellations of numerical versus general cognitive abilities. When controlling for 8 domain-general abilities, both aspects of basic numerical cognition were uniquely predictive of PC and WP development. Yet, for PC development, the additional amount of variance explained by the set of domain-general abilities was not significant, and only counting span was uniquely predictive. By contrast, for WP development, the set of domain- general abilities did provide additional explanatory value, accounting for about the same amount of variance as the basic numerical cognition variables.

Using eye tracking, Experiment 1 examined the comprehension of pronouns during reading, which revealed shorter reading times in the pronoun region and later regions when the antecedent was the subject than when it was the prepositional object. There was no effect of antecedent position. Experiment 2 showed that the choice between pronouns and repeated names during language production is also primarily affected by the antecedent’s grammatical role. Experiment 3 examined the comprehension of repeated names, showing a clear effect of antecedent position. Reading times in the name region and in later regions were longer when the antecedent was 1st mentioned than 2nd mentioned, whereas the antecedent’s grammatical role only affected regression measures in the name region, showing more processing difficulty with a subject than prepositional-object antecedent. Thus, the processing of pronouns is primarily driven by antecedent grammatical role rather than position, whereas the processing of repeated names is most strongly affected by position, suggesting that different representations and processing constraints underlie the processing of pronouns and names."

We report on a longitudinal study of 519 low-income American children ages 5–12, with a focus on mathematics performance. We found that nonsymbolic quantity knowledge and repeating pattern knowledge at the end of preschool were reliable predictors of performance on standards-based high-stakes tests across three different grade levels (4th–6th grade), over and above other math and academic skills. Further, these effects of preschool math knowledge were partially mediated through symbolic mapping and calculation knowledge at the end of 1st grade. These findings suggest that nonsymbolic quantity knowledge and repeating pattern knowledge prior to formal schooling are valuable indicators of low-income children’s performance on high-stakes state math tests in the middle grades.

The present study was designed to examine whether this impaired acquisition was attributable to a lack of automatization, and whether the reported preserved consolidation was attributable to the use of DDs’ conscious compensation strategies. These aims were implemented by testing a skill-learning task in dyslexics and normal readers using a dual task paradigm. The impact of dual task costs on participants’ performance was used as an indication for automaticity. Method: DD and control groups completed a sequence-learning task over a first session (acquisition) and a second session 24 hours later (consolidation). The task was performed by half of the participants under a full attention condition and by the other half under a divided attention condition. Results: Consistent with previous reports in the literature, divided attention impaired sequence learning in both groups. Nevertheless, divided attention resulted in delayed acquisition of the motor skill in the DD group compared with normal readers. Finally, divided attention enhanced motor procedural consolidation only in the control group. Conclusions: The differential effect of divided attention on acquisition and consolidation of procedural skill in DD and normal readers supports the cerebellum deficit hypothesis in DD. In addition, the enhanced skill consolidation in normal readers under divided attention suggests that attentional requirements are not necessary for all types of human learning."

Method: We tested procedural learning in adults with dyslexia (n 15) and matched-controls (n 15) using 2 versions of the weather prediction task: feedback (FB) and paired-associate (PA). In the FB-based task, participants learned associations between cues and outcomes initially by guessing and subsequently through feedback indicating the correctness of response. In the PA-based learning task, participants viewed the cue and its associated outcome simultaneously without overt response or feedback. In both versions, participants trained across 150 trials. Learning was assessed in a subsequent test without presentation of the outcome, or corrective feedback. Results: The dyslexia group exhibited impaired learning compared with the control group on both the FB and PA versions of the weather prediction task. Conclusions: The results indicate that the ability to learn by feedback is not selectively impaired in dyslexia. Rather it seems that the probabilistic nature of the task, shared by the FB and PA versions of the weather prediction task, hampers learning in those with dyslexia. Results are discussed in light of procedural learning impairments among participants with dyslexia."

On the basis of the literature regarding gender differences in affect, behavior, and cognition, it was hypothesized that women would focus more on the relational aspects of interdependence, whereas men would focus more on the collective aspects of interdependence. Five studies in which gender differences in self-construals, emotional experience, selective memory, and behavioral intentions were examined supported the expansion of the model to include both relational and collective aspects of interdependence."

Patients with Alzheimer's disease had intact priming on picture-naming and category-exemplar identification tasks and impaired priming on word-stem completion and category-exemplar production tasks. Division of study-phase attention in healthy participants reduced priming on word-stem completion and category-exemplar production tasks but not on picture-naming and category-exemplar identification tasks. The parallel dissociations in normal and abnormal memory cannot be explained by implicit-explicit or perceptual-conceptual distinctions but are explained by an identification-production distinction. There may be separable cognitive and neural bases for implicit modulation of identification and production forms of knowledge.

A prescreening filtered out those who were not soldiers, who did not game and who were suffering from various psychological problems in the last six months. The remaining soldiers filled out these inventories; general and military demographics, history of video game play, Emotional Reactivity and Numbing Scale (ERNS), and a Trauma Inventory. They were then asked to provide two dreams, one recent and one that was impactful from their military service. Following the military dream they filled out Impactful Dreams Questionnaire (IDQ) about that dream only. Dream content analysis was conducted using threat simulation, war content and lucid/control/gaming content. High and low end frequency gamer groups were identified and compared on these dream content scales. Because the nightmare literature shows that affect load and distress are predictors of nightmare suffering. ERNS and Trauma history were covariates in the ANCOVA’s on gamer group x dream type. It was found that the high end gaming group exhibited less threat and war content in their military dreams than the low end group."

To what extent does angular declination drive performance when viewing time is limited? Participants judged target distances in a real-world environment with viewing durations ranging from 36–220 ms. An important role for angular declination was supported by experiments showing that the cue provides information about egocentric distance even on the very first glimpse, and that it supports a sensitive response to distance in the absence of other useful cues. Performance was better at 220 ms viewing durations than for briefer glimpses, suggesting that the perception of distance is dynamic even within the time frame of a typical eye fixation. Critically, performance in limited viewing trials was better when preceded by a 15 second preview of the room without a designated target. The results indicate that the perception of distance is powerfully shaped by memory from prior visual experience with the scene. A theoretical framework for the dynamic perception of distance is presented."

Interestingly, recent studies showed that reading and spelling skills can also dissociate. The current study investigated whether spelling skills (indicating orthographic knowledge) are associated with the application of orthographic strategies during reading. We examined eye movements of 137 third- and fourth-graders who were either good or poor readers with or without a spelling deficit: 43 children with typical reading and spelling skills, 28 with isolated spelling deficits, 28 with isolated reading deficits, and 38 with combined reading and spelling deficits. Although we expected to find reduced reliance on orthographic reading processes among poor spellers, this was evident for the group with combined deficits only. Both isolated deficit groups applied sublexical and lexical processes in a similar amount to typically developing children. Our findings suggest that reading rests on orthographic strategies even if lexical representations are poor as indicated by a deficit in spelling skills. Findings also show that dysfluent reading does not result only from overreliance on decoding."

At present, it is not entirely clear how susceptibility to stereotype threat develops, as empirical evidence for stereotype threat effects across the school years is inconsistent. In a series of 3 studies, with a total sample of 931 students, we investigated stereotype threat effects during childhood and adolescence. Three activation methods were used, ranging from implicit to explicit. Across studies, we found no evidence that the mathematics performance of school-age girls was impacted by stereotype threat. In 2 of the studies, there were gender differences on the mathematics assessment regardless of whether stereotype threat was activated. Potential reasons for these findings are discussed, including the possibility that stereotype threat effects only occur in very specific circumstances or that they are in fact occurring all the time.

Findings showed a significant gender difference in math performance, anxiety, and visuospatial working memory. Further, there was a mediating chain from gender to the worry component of anxiety to visuospatial working memory to math performance. The results suggest that women’s heightened worry may have utilized their visuospatial working memory resources, and the resulting gender differences in working memory were associated with gender differences on a math test. The present research contributes to our understanding of affective and cognitive factors underlying gender differences in mathematics.

Translation accuracy scores and cognitive load self-rating scales were used to measure differences between various acquisition conditions. After 3 consecutive days of acquisition, contrasting effects were found depending on levels of expertise. Analyses revealed that multiple-speaker acquisition conditions facilitated perceptual learning of foreign-accented English for higher expertise EFL learners, whereas single-speaker acquisition facilitated learning for lower expertise EFL learners. These results suggest that effective learning of foreign language in spoken form should take into account both the instructional format and learners’ expertise levels."

Two experiments addressed whether such complete changes can be observed in casual speech, and if so, whether they trigger perceptual compensation. Experiment 1 used recordings of naive speakers and found that the presence of following context supporting place assimilation led to an increase in miscommunication rate when listeners were asked to identify the potentially assimilated words. This result was also obtained when trained phoneticians gave their considered judgments of a subset of the stimuli. Experiment 2 examined the extent to which words articulated correctly by naive speakers (e.g., rum) would be perceived as assimilated and found that compensation for assimilation in these stimuli depended on the type of following phonemic context and the semantic fit with the preceding sentence. These results suggest that place assimilation does involve complete alternations and that the perceptual system can compensate for them in certain circumstances."

However the reasons why RAN speed discriminates DD from typical readers are not yet fully understood. Our study was aimed to identify some of the cognitive mechanisms underlying RAN-reading relationship by comparing one group of 32 children with DD with an age-matched control group of typical readers on a naming and a visual recognition task both using a discrete-trial methodology , in addition to a serial RAN task, all using the same stimuli (digits and colors). Results showed a significant slowness of DD children in both serial and discrete-trial naming tasks regardless of type of stimulus, but no difference between the two groups on the discrete-trial recognition task. Significant differences between DD and control participants in the RAN task disappeared when performance in the discrete-trial naming task was partialled out by covariance analysis for colors, but not for digits. The same pattern held in a subgroup of DD subjects with a history of early language delay (LD). By contrast, in a subsample of DD children without LD the RAN deficit was specific for digits and disappeared after slowness in discrete-trial naming was partialled out. Slowness in discrete-trial naming was more evident for LD than for noLD DD children. Overall, our results confirm previous evidence indicating a name-retrieval deficit as a cognitive impairment underlying RAN slowness in DD children. This deficit seems to be more marked in DD children with previous LD. Moreover, additional cognitive deficits specifically associated with serial RAN tasks have to be taken into account when explaining deficient RAN speed of these latter children. We suggest that partially different cognitive dysfunctions underpin superficially similar RAN impairments in different subgroups of DD subjects."

According to this theory, reasoning on what is possible from the truth of a sentence would be psychologically basic, whereas reasoning the other way round, on the truth or falsity of a sentence from a given state of affairs, would require some meta-ability. The present study tested the developmental corollary of this theory, which is that reasoning about possibilities should develop first, whereas the development of reasoning about truth-value should be delayed. For this purpose, 3rd, 6th, and 9th graders as well as adults were presented with tasks requiring them to evaluate either the possibilities compatible with conditional sentences or the truth-value of these sentences from these same possibilities. The results revealed 2 phenomena. First, the same developmental trend was observed in both tasks with 3 successive interpretational levels: conjunctive, biconditional, and then conditional. Second, there was a developmental lag between the 2 forms of reasoning—with developmental transitions from one level to the next occurring about 3 years later when reasoning about truth-value. The implications of these results for theories of cognitive development and of reasoning are discussed."

The authors found that holistic-configural effects can arise from object representations that are differentiated in terms of features or parts. Moreover, a holistic-inclusive effect was correlated with changes in the right FFA.

ANS acuity was related to accuracy of placements in the coordinate plane and expression evaluation but not to schema memory. Frequency of fact retrieval errors was related to schema memory but not to coordinate plane or expression evaluation accuracy. The results suggest that the ANS may contribute to or be influenced by spatial–numerical and numerical-only quantity judgments in algebraic contexts, whereas difficulties in committing addition facts to long-term memory may presage slow formation of memories for the basic structure of algebra equations.

Prosodic phrase boundaries are characterized by temporal grouping of functionally related speech elements and can facilitate syntactic processing of speech. For example, temporary syntactic ambiguities, such as early-closure structures, are processed faster when prosodic phrase boundaries are present. We examined children’s prosodic facilitation by measuring their efficiency of sentence processing for temporary syntactic ambiguities spoken with (facilitating) versus without (neutral) prosodic phrase boundaries. Both groups of children benefited similarly from prosodic facilitation, displaying faster reaction times in facilitating compared to neutral prosody. These findings indicate that the use of prosodic phrase boundaries for speech processing is not impaired in children with dyslexia."

Findings on general reading outcomes, in English and French, are reviewed first, followed by a review of reading outcomes for students who are at risk for reading difficulty because of below-average levels of academic ability, poor first language abilities, disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, and minority language status. There follows a review of studies on individual differences in reading outcomes, including research on students with or at risk for reading difficulties, and on interventions to support students with reading difficulties in immersion. Conclusions along with suggestions for future research are offered. The Canadian educational landscape changed dramatically in 1965 with the introduction of a French immersion program in the small community of St. Lambert, Quebec. This program took a radical departure from traditional education in Canada by educat- ing English-speaking students in French. Students in this new program received initial literacy (and academic) instruction in French before being taught reading and writing in English. Im- mersion programs have proliferated across the country (and indeed worldwide) since 1965, and there are currently over 300,000 Canadian students in immersion (Canadian Parents for French, n.d.). The original St. Lambert program provided all instruction in French beginning in kindergarten until the end of Grade 2. Alter- native forms of immersion have been developed, varying primarily with respect to when French is used as a medium of curriculum instruction (in primary or middle elementary grades, or later—in late elementary or high school) and how much instruction is given through French; distinctions are usually made between total and partial immersion with the latter consisting of less than 100% instruction and a minimum of 50%. Detailed descriptions of pro- totypical immersion program models can be found in Genesee (1987, 2004). We review findings on reading acquisition in students in early French immersion programmes (see Genesee, 1987, 2004; Lam- bert & Tucker, 1972; and Swain & Lapkin, 1982, for general reviews). There was an initial surge in research on immersion programs that lasted until approximately the mid1980s. Research during this period was motivated largely by concerns about the effects of immersion on student achievement, including reading. This has been followed by research with a greater focus on individual differences in, and processes underlying, the acquisition of French reading skills in immersion. We begin with research that has examined general reading outcomes in English and French, followed by studies on students who might be considered at risk for low levels of achievement in reading because of below-average levels of academic ability, poor or impaired first-language abili- ties, disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, and minority lan- guage status.

Many experimental studies have shown that induced state rumination exacerbates the effect of laboratory stressors on negative affect. The current study examines whether use of rumination in response to specific real-life events moderates the association between unpleasant daily events and negative mood. One hundred fifty-seven undergraduate participants completed daily diaries for six consecutive days. The daily diaries assessed current mood, a survey of unpleasant daily events, and use of rumination in response to the most unpleasant daily event. Data were analyzed with a multilevel random coefficient modeling (MRCM) approach. It was predicted and found that use of rumination in daily life moderates the relation between unpleasant daily events and negative mood. On days when participants reported intense rumination use, higher levels of unpleasant daily events predicted higher levels of negative mood. By contrast, on days when participants reported lower use of rumination, higher levels of unpleasant events were not associated with higher levels of negative mood. This study is the first to demonstrate that real-life use of rumination moderates the relation between unpleasant events and mood in daily life."

Using an attachment framework, we examined the relation of social threats and rewards to investment model constructs (i.e., commitment, satisfaction, investment, quality of alternatives) in 3 studies. Study 1 (N = 533) and Study 2 (N = 866) assessed attachment styles, reward and threat perceptions, and investment model constructs, and data were analyzed using structural equation models. In Study 3 (N = 358), reward and threat perceptions were experimentally manipulated followed by measurement of investment model constructs. Results showed that attachment avoidance was uniquely associated with lower perceptions of reward, whereas attachment anxiety was uniquely associated with stronger perceptions of threat. Stronger reward perceptions were associated with higher commitment, investment, and satisfaction, as well as lower quality of alternatives in all studies. Stronger threat perceptions were associated with lower satisfaction in all 3 studies. Stronger threat perceptions were also correlated with higher levels of investment and commitment, although these effects did not replicate in our experimental study. Thus, perceptions of reward appear unambiguously associated with higher levels of all facets of commitment, whereas perceptions of threat are most strongly associated with lower satisfaction. These results underscore the importance of considering the effects of rewards and threats simultaneously in commitment processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)"

First, we aimed to develop a screening protocol for early identification of Brazilian children at risk for dyslexia; second, we aimed to identify the predictive variables of this protocol using Principal Component Analysis. The major step involved in developing this protocol was the selection of variables, which were chosen based on the literature review and linguistic criteria. The screening protocol was composed of seven cognitive-linguistic skills: Letter naming; Phonological Awareness (which comprises the following subtests: Rhyme production, Rhyme identification, Syllabic segmentation, Production of words from a given phoneme, Phonemic Synthesis, and Phonemic analysis); Phonological Working memory, Rapid naming Speed; Silent reading; Reading of words and nonwords; and Auditory Comprehension of sentences from pictures. A total of 149 children, aged from 6 years to 6 and 11, of both genders who were enrolled in the 1st grade of elementary public schools were submitted to the screening protocol. Principal Component Analysis revealed four factors, accounting for 64.45% of the variance of the Protocol variables: first factor (“pre-reading”), second factor (“decoding”), third factor (“Reading”), and fourth factor “Auditory processing”.

START,START,2052447448,investigating differences in general comprehension skill,1990,"morton ann gernsbacher, kathleen r varner, mark e faust",journal of experimental psychology learning memory and cognition,1,419,70,"Individuals differ in many ways, including comprehension skill. Laboratory research documents these differences. However, the lion’s share of this research investigates comprehension of only one modality—namely, the printed word—and individuals who differ at only one stage of skill development—namely, beginning readers. Therefore, it is not too surprising that the processes suggested to underlie differences in comprehension skill are often specific to reading (see excellent reviews by Carr, 1981; Perfetti, 1985).

When considering differences in adult comprehension skill, we can go beyond those sources. At an adult level of proficiency, skill at comprehending written language is strongly related to skill at comprehending auditory language; in other words, reading and listening correlate highly (Baddeley, Logie, Nimmo-Smith, & Brereton, 1985; Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; Jackson & McClelland, 1979; Palmer, MacLeod. Hunt, & Davidson, 1985; Perfetti & Lesgold, 1977; Sticht, 1972).

For example, listening comprehension skill, measured by auditorily presenting the comprehension sections of the Davis reading test, correlates .80, .74, and .68 with reading comprehension skill, measured by visually presenting the comprehension sections of the Davis reading test, the Nelson-Denny reading test, and the Washington Pre-College Scholastic Aptitude Test, respectively (Palmer et al., 1985). These high correlations between listening and reading suggest a General Comprehension Skill factor that transcends modality (Palmer et al., 1985).

Perhaps General Comprehension Skill transcends language-based modalities; perhaps General Comprehension Skill underlies facility in comprehending nonlinguistic media, too. The similarities between comprehending text-based written or auditory stories and textless movies or picture stories surely suggest this.

For example, comprehenders perceive the same episode structure when they view a narrative as a movie without dialogue as when they hear it as text (Baggett, 1979). They make the same inferences after they view textless cartoon sequences as they make after they read verbal descriptions of those sequences (Baggett, 1975). Comprehenders can judge how plausible a sentence is just as quickly when a picture substitutes for one of the sentence’s words as when the sentence contains only words (Potter, Kroll, Yachzel, Carpenter, & Sherman, 1986). Comprehenders suffer from the same rapid forgetting of recently comprehended information when they view textless picture stories as when they read or hear text-based stories; in all three media, comprehending a new episode exacerbates this rapid forgetting (Gernsbacher, 1985). Furthermore, when comprehenders recall story episodes, they emphasize, forget, and elaborate the same information regardless of whether they originally viewed the story as a movie without dialogue or heard the story as text (Baggett, 1979; see also Poulsen, Kintsch, Kintsch, & Premack, 1979).

These similarities suggest that many of the cognitive processes involved in comprehending linguistic media are involved in comprehending nonlinguistic media. Such similarities, therefore, suggest the following hypothesis: Skill in comprehending written and auditory stories correlates highly with skill in comprehending picture stories. In other words, General Comprehension Skill might extend beyond language. We tested this hypothesis in the first experiment we report, and we found considerable support for it.

What cognitive processes and mechanisms contribute to General Comprehension Skill? To appreciate the common processes and mechanisms, we must appreciate what is common to comprehensible information across modalities. One commonality is that it is structured; therefore, the cognitive processes and mechanisms that contribute to General Comprehension Skill might have something to do with capturing and representing structure. Some cognitive processes and mechanisms that do just that are part of a simple framework we call the structure building framework (Gernsbacher, in press-a, in press-b)."

Using time metrics of chronological age and time-to-death, we compared changes in key indicators of cognitive, sensory, physical, health, social, and self-related domains.

Examining between-person differences, we found that sociodemographic characteristics (surviving to an older age at death, being a woman, lower socioeconomic status) and proxies of pathologies (comorbidities, disability, and suspected dementia) related to lower levels of late-life functioning. In contrast, little evidence was found for correlates of differential change.

However, 6 experiments (total N 1,078) revealed that good deeds are perceived as less moral if they are performed for religious reasons. Religiously motivated acts were seen as less moral than the exact same acts performed for other reasons (Experiments 1–2 and 6). Religious motivations also reduced attributions of intention and responsibility (Experiments 3–6), an effect that fully mediated the effect of religious motivations on perceived morality (Experiment 6). The effects were not explained by different perceptions of motivation orientation (i.e., intrinsic vs. extrinsic) across conditions (Experiment 4) and also were evident when religious upbringing led to an intuitive moral response (Experiment 5). Effects generalized across religious and nonreligious participants. When viewing a religiously motivated good deed, people infer that actually helping others is, in part, a side effect of other motivations rather than an end in itself. Thus, religiously motivated actors are seen as less responsible than secular actors for their good deeds, and their helping behavior is viewed as less moral than identical good deeds performed for either unclear or secular motivations."

Partly on the basis of observation and previous research, the assumption was made that the American sample would report more self-enhancement tendencies than would the Danish sample. Consistent with this assumption, which was supported by the data, 2 hypotheses were tested: (a) The Americans would overestimate the prevalence of the various risk behaviors (among their peers) more so than would the Danes and (b) those estimates would be more closely linked to their own risk behaviors for the American sample.

However, mens rea is not legally required for strict liability crimes, such as speeding, for which someone is guilty even if ignorant or deceived about her speed. In 3 experiments involving participants responding to descriptive vignettes, we investigated whether the division of strict liability crimes in the law reflects an aspect of laypeople's intuitive moral cognition. Experiment 1 (N = 396; 236 male, 159 female, 1 other; Mage = 30) found evidence that it does: ignorance and deception were less mitigating for strict liability crimes than for ""mens rea"" crimes. Experiments 2 (N = 413; 257 male, 154 female, 2 other; Mage = 31) and 3 (N = 404; 183 male, 221 female, Mage = 35) revealed that strict liability crimes are not treated as pure moral violations, but additionally as violations of convention. We found that for strict liability crimes, ratings of moral wrongness and punishment were influenced to a greater extent by the fact that a rule had been violated, even when harm was kept constant, mirroring the legal distinction of malum prohibitum (wrong as prohibited) versus malum in se (wrong in itself). Further, we found that rules prohibiting strict liability crimes were judged more arbitrary than corresponding rules for ""mens rea"" crimes, and that this judgment was related to the role of mental states. Jointly, the findings suggest a surprising correspondence between the law and laypeople's intuitive judgments. (PsycINFO Database Record"

In contrast, many models of rational inference treat the mind as a Laplacean Demon, equipped with unlimited time, knowledge, and computational might. Following H. Simon's notion of satisficing, the authors have proposed a family of algorithms based on a simple psychological mechanism: onereason decision making. These fast and frugal algorithms violate fundamental tenets of classical rationality: They neither look up nor integrate all information. By computer simulation, the authors held a competition between the satisficing ""Take The Best"" algorithm and various ""rational"" inference procedures (e.g., multiple regression). The Take The Best algorithm matched or outperformed all competitors in inferential speed and accuracy. This result is an existence proof that cognitive mechanisms capable of successful performance in the real world do not need to satisfy the classical norms of rational inference."

Although this tendency is one of the most fundamental phenomena in social psychology, its causes and consequences remain poorly understood. This article sketches an intellectual history of the correspondence bias as an evolving problem in social psychology, describes 4 mechanisms (lack of awareness, unrealistic expectations, inflated categorizations, and incomplete corrections) that produce distinct forms of correspondence bias, and discusses how the consequences of correspondence-biased inferences may perpetuate such inferences. One will seldom go wrong if one attributes extreme actions to vanity, average ones to habit, and petty ones to fear. (Friedrich Nietzsche, 1886/1984, p. 59) Despite the homilies of philosophers, no one has yet found a simple formula for understanding others. The problem, of course, is that a person's inner self is hidden from view. Character, motive, belief, desire, and intention play leading roles in people's construal of others, and yet none of these constructs can actually be observed. As such, people are forced into the difficult business of inferring these intangibles from that which is, in fact, observable: other people's words and deeds. When one infers the invisible from the visible, one risks making a mistake. Three decades of research in social psychology have shown that many of the mistakes people make are of a kind: When people observe behavior, they often conclude that the person who performed the behavior was predisposed to do so—that the person's behavior corresponds to the person's unique dispositions—and they draw such conclusions even when a logical analysis suggests they should not. In this article, we describe the causes and consequences of this particular mistake, which we call the correspondence bias. We do not attempt a complete review of the voluminous literature on this topic. Rather, we first define the correspondence"

Because grapheme--phoneme correspondence (GPC) knowledge was treated as person and word specific, it was concluded that it is neither necessary nor sufficient for a student to know all GPCs in a word before accurately decoding the word. Controlling for word-specific GPC knowledge, students with lower phonemic awareness and slower rapid naming skill have lower predicted probabilities of correct decoding than do counterparts with superior skills. By assessing a Person × Word interaction, it was found that students with lower phonemic awareness have more difficulty applying knowledge of complex vowel graphemes compared with complex consonant graphemes when decoding unfamiliar words.

This article examines how harsh blame can be “civilized.” A core construct here is the historicist narrative, which is a story-like account of how a person came to be the sort of person she is. We argue that historicist narratives regarding immoral actors can temper blame and that this happens via a novel mechanism. To illuminate that mechanism, we offer a novel theoretical perspective on lay beliefs about free will. We distinguish two senses of free will: (1) Freedom of action, which portrays the will as a dynamic choice-making mechanism and concerns whether the actor can exert volitional control via that mechanism at the time of action, and (2) Control of self-formation, which portrays the will as an enduring disposition (e.g., persistent desire to humiliate) and refers to whether the actor is truly the source of that disposition. Five experiments show that historicist narratives have no effect on perceived freedom of action, but rather temper blame by reducing perceived self-formative control. We also provide evidence against several additional theoretically-derived alternative mediators (e.g., intentionality, perceived suffering). Further underlining the need to distinguish free will concepts, we show that biological narratives — unlike historicist narratives — temper blame via reductions in perceived freedom of action. Finally, to illuminate the meaning of “civilized” blame,” we show that historicist narratives specifically reduce the urge to inflict spiteful punishments on offenders, but leave intact the urge to non-violently guide the offender toward moral improvement."

Dual process theories claim that analytic operations involve time-consuming executive processing, whereas heuristic operations are fast and automatic. In two experiments to test whether proportional reasoning is heuristic-based, the participants solved “proportional” problems, for which proportional solution methods provide correct answers, and “nonproportional” problems known to elicit incorrect answers based on the assumption of proportionality. In Experiment 1, the available solution time was restricted. In Experiment 2, the executive resources were burdened with a secondary task. Both manipulations induced an increase in proportional answers and a decrease in correct answers to nonproportional problems.

Do these sources of bias impact legal decisions, which are frequently made by people subject to factors that have been proposed to reduce bias (training and accountability)? To answer the question, we examined the potential for three major social-psychological theories of gender bias (role-congruity theory, ambivalent sexism, and implicit bias) to predict outcomes of labor arbitration decisions. In the first study, undergraduate students and professional arbitrators made decisions about two mock arbitration cases in which the gender of the employee-grievants was experimentally manipulated. Student participants' decisions showed the predicted gender bias, whereas the decisions of experienced professionals did not. Individual-level attitudes did not predict the extent of the observed bias and accountability did not attenuate it. In the second study, arbitrators’ explicit and implicit gender attitudes were significant predictors of their decisions in published cases. The laboratory and field results suggest that context, expertise, and implicit and explicit attitudes are relevant to legal decision-making, but that laboratory experiments alone may not fully capture the nature of their effect on legal professionals’ decisions in real cases."

Although the groups did not differ in performance on a test of spatial memory, or on their ability to remember the location of individual words in a text, the good comprehenders were better at remembering the order in which specific words appeared in a text. This finding again suggests that their superior search strategies may arise because of their better memory for the order of events in a text."

To test this, we assessed bimanual coordination in dyslexic and nondis- abled boys using an Etch-a-Sketch-like task. Group performance was equivalent for parallel hand movements (both clockwise). However, the dyslexics showed significant impairments on mirror movements, particularly in their left hands, and often unknowingly reverted to parallel movements when visual feedback was removed. Although these difficulties generally suggest impaired interhemi- spheric coordination, specific mirror movement deficits have never before been observed in any population. We propose that deficient interhemispheric collaboration combined with anomalous ipsilateral manual control may account for the dyslexics' performance. Recent theoretical proposals suggest that efficient interhemi- spheric integration is important in reading development (Glad- stone & Best, 1985; Kershner, 1985a) and that dyslexic children may have deficits in interhemispheric collaboration (Davidson, Leslie, & Saron, 1988; Denckla, 1986; Gladstone & Best, 1985; Kershner, 1985b). A number of empirical investigations lend support to this proposal. Compared with normal readers, read- ing impaired children show less interhemispheric electroen- cephalogram (EEG) coherence (SEar, Hanley, & Simmons, 1973). Anatomical measures of the corpus callosum, the major neocortical commissure, have been reported for two dyslexic brains; both showed abnormal thinning (Drake, 1968; Witelson in McGuinness, 1985).

Whereas normal age-matched children display a stable right-ear advantage on verbal dichotic tests, reading disabled children switch the direc- tion of ear advantage as a function of which ear is attended to (Obrzut et at., 1981) and whether the response mode is oral or written (Kershner et at., 1984). This ""attentional switching"" a phenomenon usually seen only among younger normal chil- dren, has been attributed to the inadequate regulation of atten- tional resources between the hemispheres (Hiscock & Kins- bourne, 1980). Thus, although contemporary views of dyslexia have more commonly attributed reading failure to left-hemisphere impair- ment (Rudel, 1985), recent evidence has also implicated deficient interhemispheric attentional regulation and sensory integration. However, a number of questions about interhemi- spheric coordination among disabled readers remain unan- swered. For example, relatively little is known about the role of interhemispheric processes in the bilateral motor anomalies that have been clinically observed for many years in reading disordered children (Denckla, 1985; Tomaino, in press). Re- cently, Denckla (1985) has stated that ""Orton's [ 1937] concept of mixed dominance may be important not in terms of 'com- peting engrams' in the visual field, but rather in terms of [inter- hemispherically] competing motor coordination systems in the anterior portions of the brain"" (p. 193). In light of the theory and data suggesting impaired interhemispheric communication among dyslexics, it would be important to determine whether their atypical motor performance is also indicative of anoma- lous interhemispheric processes. The motor anomalies of ""pure dyslexic"" children (i.e., chil- dren with primary reading impairment but without other sig- nificant language, neurodevelopmental, or emotional disorders) appear to be largely confined to fine or repetitive movements of the distal musculature of the fingers and hands.

Experiment 4 showed that the composite face effect was enhanced only for low spatial frequencies, but not for intermediate spatial frequencies known be critical for face recognition.

In so doing, we synthesize a substantial body of research on detection of regularities across the domains of speech perception, word segmentation, word–referent mapping, and grammar learning. In addition, we outline our framework for how invariance detection might serve as a perceptual gateway to more sophisticated communication by providing a foundation for subsequent emergent capacities. We test our hypothesis using the domain of word mapping as a case in point, emphasizing its epigenetic nature: Word mapping is rooted in the real-time interactions between the infant and the physical world.

The underlying implicit assumption in previous work has been that these emotions reflect what the rest of the group feels (i.e., collective emotions). However, one can experience an emotion in the name of her or his group, which is inconsistent with what the collective feels. The current research investigated this phenomenon of emotional nonconformity. Particularly, we proposed that when a certain emotional reaction is perceived as appropriate, but the collective is perceived as not experiencing this emotion, people would experience stronger levels of group-based emotion, placing their emotional experience farther away from that of the collective. We provided evidence for this process across 2 different emotions: group-based guilt and group-based anger (Studies 1 and 2) and across different intergroup contexts (Israeli�Palestinian relations in Israel, and Black�White relations in the United States). In Studies 3 and 4, we demonstrate that this process is moderated by the perceived appropriateness of the collective emotional response. Studies 4 and 5 further provided evidence for the mechanisms underlying this effect, pointing to a process of emotional burden (i.e., feeling responsible for carrying the emotion in the name of the group) and of emotional transfer (i.e., transferring negative feelings one has toward the ingroup, toward the event itself).

However, the relation may be negative if working more fluently, and thus faster, reflects higher skill level. Using a dual processing theory framework, the present study argues that the validity of each assumption is dependent on the relative degree of controlled versus routine cognitive processing required by a task, as well as a person’s acquired skill. A total of 1,020 persons ages 16 to 65 years participated in the German field test of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies. Test takers completed computer-based reading and problem solving tasks. As revealed by linear mixed models, in problem solving, which required controlled processing, the time on task effect was positive and increased with task difficulty. In reading tasks, which required more routine processing, the time on task effect was negative and the more negative, the easier a task was. In problem solving, the positive time on task effect decreased with increasing skill level. In reading, the negative time on task effect increased with increasing skill level. These heterogeneous effects suggest that time on task has no uniform interpretation but is a function of task difficulty and individual skill."

Over a series of 6 experiments, we demonstrate that perceiving that one�s perspective has been taken confers many of the same interpersonal benefits as taking another�s perspective. Specifically, our data suggest that believing that another person has successfully taken one�s perspective results in an increased liking for, a greater sense of self�other overlap with, and more help provided to that person. Consistent with predictions, we find that one�s self�other overlap with the perspective taker and the amount of empathy one perceives the perspective taker to feel operate in tandem to mediate the link between perceived perspective taking and liking for the perspective taker. Further, a mediational path from perceived perspective taking to helping behavior through liking is supported. Future directions are discussed, along with implications for theory and application in domains such as intergroup relations, conflict resolution, and political campaigning.

NA During category learning, participants were required to attend either a single component or a conjunction of five components in order to correctly categorize an object. In Experiments 1-4, some evidence for unitization was found in that the conjunctive task becomes much easier with practice, and this improvement was not found for the single component task, or for conjunctive tasks where the components cannot be unitized. Influences of component order (Experiment 1), component contiguity (Experiment 2), component proximity (Experiment 3), and number of components (Experiment 4) on practice effects were found. Using a Fourier Transformation method for deconvolving response times (Experiment 5), prolonged practice effects yielded responses that were faster than expected by analytic model that integrate evidence from independently perceived components."

Under in-group criticism (vs. praise) collective narcissists expressed intention to harm the offending out-group but not other, nonoffending out-groups. This effect was specific to collective narcissism and was replicated in studies that accounted for the overlap between collective narcissism and individual narcissism, in-group positivity (in-group identification, blind and constructive patriotism), social dominance orientation, and right wing authoritarianism. The link between collective narcissism and retaliatory intergroup hostility under in-group image threat was found in the context of national identity and international relations and in the context of a social identity defined by university affiliation. Study 4 demonstrated that the relationship between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility was mediated by the perception of in-group criticism as personally threatening. The results advance our understanding of the mechanism driving the link between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility.

In six studies (N = 1,143), we investigated social psychological skill – lay individuals’ skill at predicting social psychological phenomena (e.g., social loafing, attribution effects). Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated reliable individual differences in social psychological skill. In Studies 2, 3, and 4, attributes associated with decreased cognitive and motivational bias – cognitive ability, cognitive curiosity, and melancholy and introversion – predicted social psychological skill. Studies 4 and 5 confirmed that social psychological skill is distinct from other skills (e.g., test-taking skills, intuitive physics), and relates directly to reduced motivational bias (i.e., self-deception). In Study 6, social psychological skill related to appreciating the situational causes of another individual’s behavior – reduced fundamental attribution error.

A sample of 44 children with dyslexia and 23 typical readers, aged 8 to 9, was recruited. Children with dyslexia were randomly allocated to either the training program group (n = 23) or a waiting-list control group (n = 21). The training intensively focused on letter-speech sound mapping and consisted of 34 individual sessions of 45 minutes over a five month period. The children with dyslexia showed substantial reading gains for the main word reading and spelling measures after training, improving at a faster rate than typical readers and waiting-list controls. The results are interpreted within the conceptual framework assuming a multisensory integration deficit as the most proximal cause of dysfluent reading in dyslexia.

Participants were 116 Spanish-speaking children aged six years and without special educational needs, all of whom were attending schools in a medium socioeconomic area. Descriptive/exploratory and bivariate analyses were performed with the data derived from three measures of reading ability (accuracy, speed, and efficiency), and hierarchical multivariate regression models were constructed. In general, the results confirm that, with the exception of non-alphanumeric rapid naming, the cognitive variables studied are predictors of reading performance for words and pseudowords, although their influence differs depending on the reading measures and type of linguistic unit considered . Phonemic awareness, phonological memory, and alphanumeric rapid naming were the best predictors of reading accuracy for words and pseudowords. Variability in the other two measures of reading ability (speed and efficiency) was best explained by alphanumeric rapid naming. These results suggest that reading is a complex skill that depends on different types of cognitive variables according to the age and/or level of the reader, the type of orthography and the type of measure used.

First, a new scale of sense of belonging to math was created and validated, and was found to predict unique variance in college students’ intent to pursue math in the future (Studies 1–2). Second, in a longitudinal study of calculus students (Study 3), students’ perceptions of 2 factors in their math environment—the message that math ability is a fixed trait and the stereotype that women have less of this ability than men—worked together to erode women’s, but not men’s, sense of belonging in math. Their lowered sense of belonging, in turn, mediated women’s desire to pursue math in the future and their math grades. Interestingly, the message that math ability could be acquired protected women from negative stereotypes, allowing them to maintain a high sense of belonging in math and the intention to pursue math in the future."

Gibson (1950), it is implicitly assumed in the literature that texture gradients are directly available as perceptual primitives. Yet, the depth response to compression gradients is poor compared with gradients of linear perspective. This may indicate that mechanisms for directly detecting the differential structure that constitutes a compression gradient do not exist. We tested this hypothesis outside the context of depth perception by measuring the speed with which participants could detect a gradient anomaly as a function of the number of elements in the gradient. Only in the case of linear perspective did anomalies ""pop out."" This was attributable to the emergent feature of alignment of the ends of the elements forming the gradient rather than the direct detection of its differential structure. It is argued that gradients are not perceptual primitives and that the poor depth response to compression in a variety of contexts (motion parallax, stereo, and perspective) therefore is not surprising."

Affirmations of the equal value of all human lives are culturally prominent, yet much evidence points to the fact that the young are often prioritized over the old in life-and-death decision-making contexts. Studies 1–3 aimed to reconcile this tension by showing that although individuals are seen as more equal with respect to negative rights not to be harmed or killed (though not completely equal), they are seen as less equal with respect to positive rights to be aided or saved. Age exerts a large and systematic impact on decisions about who to save and about whose death is more tragic, suggesting that individuals are seen as possessing differing amounts of contingent value. These initial studies also yielded the novel finding that, although children are prioritized over adults, older children are often prioritized over younger children. Study 4 replicated this finding with a think-aloud methodology; the study showed that the preference for older children appears to be driven by their having had more invested in their lives, their better developed social relations, and their greater understanding of death. Studies 5a–5c demonstrated the independent causal effects of each of these variables on judgments of life’s value. Finally, in Studies 6 and 7, mediation methods were used to show that older children’s more meaningful social relations primarily explain the greater value of older than of younger children.

Recent research in social cognition suggests that “warmth,” broadly construed, should be of prime importance in impression formation. Yet, some prior research suggests that information about others’ specifically moral traits—their moral “character”—may be a primary dimension. Although warmth and character have sometimes been conceived of as interchangeable, we argue that they are separable, and that across a wide variety of contexts, character is usually more important than warmth in impression formation. We first showed that moral character and social warmth traits are indeed separable (Studies 1 and 2). Further studies that used correlational and experimental methods showed that, as predicted, in most contexts, moral character information is more important in impression formation than is warmth information (Studies 2–6). Character information was also more important than warmth information with respect to judgments of traits’ perceived fundamentalness to identity, their uniquely human quality, their contextindependence, and their controllability (Study 2). Finally, Study 7 used an archival method to show that moral character information appears more prominently than warmth information in obituaries, and more strongly determines the impressions people form of the individuals described in those obituaries.

Comparisons of potential neuropsychological predictors of arithmetical calculation were also conducted to determine whether these variables differ significantly for participants with iCL/P. METHOD:Participants (N = 176; 93 iCL/P and 83 Control) ranged in age from 7 to 26 years old. A standardized battery of achievement and neuropsychological skills was administered. Between group differences on math achievement was assessed through a univariate analysis of covariance. Relationships between neuropsychological measures and math achievement were analyzed separately for participants with iCL/P and controls through hierarchical linear regressions. RESULTS:Arithmetical calculation was significantly lower for the iCL/P group. Rapid naming, sustained attention, and visual-spatial organization were significant predictors for the iCL/P group; rapid naming was the lone variable that was significantly more predictive of arithmetical calculation for the iCL/P group than for control participants. CONCLUSIONS:These results suggest that inefficient verbal label retrieval related to short-term memory (STM) deficits underlie the calculation difficulties of individuals with iCL/P.

This study did not find a link between self-perception changes and large-request compliance in 2 experiments, although manipulations successfully altered self-rated helpfulness. Specifically, self-rated helpfulness increased (in Experiments 1 & 2) if participants' consent to a small favor brought social approval, and the ratings decreased (in Experiment 2) when social feedback for the small favor contained consensus information (i.e., indicated everyone else was also doing the favor). However, the ratings failed to predict either foot-in-the-door effects actually observed or compliance generally.

Because successful RAN performance depends on the close coordination of a number of abilities, it is unclear what specific skills drive this RAN-reading relationship. The current study used concurrent recordings of young adult participants' vocalizations and eye movements during the RAN task to assess how individual variation in RAN performance depends on the coordination of visual and vocal processes. Results showed that fast RAN times are facilitated by having the eyes 1 or more items ahead of the current vocalization, as long as the eyes do not get so far ahead of the voice as to require a regressive eye movement to an earlier item. These data suggest that optimizing RAN performance is a problem of scheduling eye movements and vocalization given memory constraints and the efficiency of encoding and articulatory control. Both RAN completion time (conventionally used to indicate RAN performance) and eye-voice relations predicted some aspects of participants' eye movements on a separate sentence reading task. However, eye-voice relations predicted additional features of first-pass reading that were not predicted by RAN completion time. This shows that measurement of eye-voice patterns can identify important aspects of individual variation in reading that are not identified by the standard measure of RAN performance. We argue that RAN performance predicts reading ability because both tasks entail challenges of scheduling cognitive and linguistic processes that operate simultaneously on multiple linguistic inputs."

Gender, in particular, has been proposed to play an important role in understanding different risk factors and consequences of mental health conditions, and in tailoring treatments for men and women to increase impact (Dwight-Johnson, Sherbourne, Liao, & Wells, 2000; Gorman, 2006; Kornstein, 1997; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2004; Reinherz, Giaconia, Carmola Hauf, Wasserman & Paradis, 2000; Weisman & Olfson, 1995). As interest in effect modification by gender has grown, at the same time propensity score methods have emerged as a key tool for estimating causal effects in non-experimental studies (see Stuart, 2010). In many instances, randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for testing causal relationships, are not ethical or feasible; propensity score methods have shown to be useful in those cases. However, it is unclear how to combine effect modification with propensity scores as this topic has received little attention in the methodological literature. For instance, the presence of a depressive disorder cannot be randomized to individuals; thus to answer questions about potential differential effects of depression for men and women, we are in need of ways to combine moderation analysis with advanced causal methods, such as propensity scores. This paper provides an overview of the different methods by which propensity score methods can be combined with moderation analyses in order to estimate subgroup differences in potential causal effects in non-experimental data. We apply these techniques to an investigation of gender differences in substance use consequences of depression using data from a longitudinal community cohort study."

In contrast with the majority of action theories in psychology and philosophy, a logical connection between action and intention is defended and, consequently, a causal relationship between action and intention is refuted. This is illustrated by reference to one of the most widely known and applied psychological action theories: the theory of planned behavior (I. Ajzen, 1991). However, the logical-connection argument can be circumvented if the existing research findings are reinterpreted as part of a psychology of intention.

The topic model performs well in predicting word association and the effects of semantic association and ambiguity on a variety of language-processing and memory tasks.

The results of 4 studies demonstrate that individuals experiencing identified ambivalence are less influenced by cognitive biases (i.e., the framing effect, availability bias, and conjunction bias) than individuals experiencing no ambivalence or felt ambivalence. Notably, we find that contextual awareness accounts for the effect of identified ambivalence on decision effectiveness. We then investigate the role of trait self-control as a specific contingency in our model; our results indicate that identified ambivalence leads to effective decisions when individuals are low in trait self-control.

However, developmental neuroimaging research has only recently begun to move beyond characterizing brain function exclusively in terms of magnitude of neural activation to incorporate estimates of variability. No prior neuroimaging study has done so in the domain of emotion regulation. We investigated how age and affective experiences relate to spatial and temporal variability in neural activity during emotion regulation. In the current study, 70 typically developing youth aged 8 to 17 years completed a cognitive reappraisal task of emotion regulation while undergoing functional MRI. Estimates of spatial and temporal variability during regulation were calculated across a network of brain regions, defined a priori, and were then related to age and affective experiences. Results showed that increasing age was associated with reduced spatial and temporal variability in a set of frontoparietal regions (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobule) known to be involved in effortful emotion regulation. In addition, youth who reported less negative affect during regulation had less spatial variability in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which has previously been linked to cognitive reappraisal. We interpret age-related reductions in spatial and temporal variability as implying neural specialization. These results suggest that the development of emotion regulation is undergirded by a process of neural specialization and open a host of possibilities for incorporating neural variability into the study of emotion regulation development.

The second step was giving up general physiology and announcing that he would specialize in the nervous system and psychology. Based upon this premise, he declared that he would go to Heidelberg and study with Helmholtz and Wundt. However, he then deferred going there. When, at last, he was urged by an influential friend of his father's to accompany him to Heidelberg, he employed his default stratagem: He simply fled. He returned home after 3 terms in Europe without enrolling at a single university.

Participants in an empathy-induction condition were asked to take the perspective of the defendant and to detail how they would be thinking and feeling if they were the defendant. Control condition participants received no such instructions. Results indicated that, compared to jurors in the control condition, jurors who were asked to take the defendant's perspective had more empathy for the defendant (without feeling more similar to or more sympathy for the defendant), found the defendant less guilty and less responsible for the murder, and were more likely to consider abuse to be a mitigating factor in the killing. Overall, compared to men, women were more likely to believe the defendant's abuse allegations, find the defendant credible, and consider the defendant to be less responsible for the murder. Women in the empathy condition found the defendant less guilty than did all other jurors. Finally, child defendant gender was also varied, but this had few effects on case judgments overall. Jurors, however, were more likely to believe that the girl defendant was sexually abused than the boy defendant. We discuss theoretical implications for understanding the social psychological construct of empathy as well as implications for understanding jurors' decisions in cases involving child sexual assault allegations."

Most research on this question has focused on the correspondence between measures of implicit attitudes and measures of explicit attitudes, with low correspondence interpreted as showing that people have little awareness of their implicit attitudes. We took a different approach and directly asked participants to predict their results on upcoming Implicit Association Test (IAT) measures of implicit attitudes toward 5 social groups. We found that participants were surprisingly accurate in their predictions. Across 4 studies, predictions were accurate regardless of whether implicit attitudes were described as true attitudes or culturally learned associations (Studies 1 and 2), regardless of whether predictions were made as specific response patterns (Study 1) or as conceptual responses (Studies 2–4), and regardless of how much experience or explanation participants received before making their predictions (Study 4). Study 3 further suggested that participants’ predictions reflected unique insight into their own implicit responses, beyond intuitions about how people in general might respond.

However, so far, DL results have been mixed. The current study assesses lateralization of speech processing by using DL in a sample of children at familial risk (FR) for dyslexia. In order to determine whether atypical lateralization of speech processing relates to reading ability, or is a correlate of being at familial risk, the current study compares the laterality index of FR children who did and did not become dyslexic, and a control group of readers without dyslexia. DL was tested in 3rd grade and in 5/6th grade. Results indicate that at both time points, all three groups have a right ear advantage, indicative of more pronounced left-hemispheric processing. However, the FR-dyslexic children are less good at reporting from the left ear than controls and FR-nondyslexic children. This impediment relates to reading fluency."

According to one theoretical account, these phonological problems are due to low-level problems in auditory perception of dynamic acoustic cues. Evidence for this has come from studies showing poor discrimination of frequency-modulated from unmodulated tones. We measured frequency modulation detection limens (FMDLs) in 16 children with specific reading disability (SRD group), 16 children with mild to moderate hearing loss (SNH group) and 16 age-matched controls (CA group) aged 8–14. To obtain information about possible mechanisms used in frequency modulation detection, FMDLs were measured at modulation rates of 2 and 20 Hz, both in the absence and the presence of amplitude modulation, intended to force listeners to rely, if possible, upon phase-locking cues. Although both the SNH and SRD groups showed a trend for elevated FMDLs at both 2 and 20 Hz, these differences reached statistical significance for the SNH group alone. However, the SNH group had no evidence of literacy impairments. This study thus shows that impairments in perceiving dynamically modulated auditory stimuli do not necessarily lead to difficulty in learning to read."

We measured steady-state sweep visual evoked potentials (sVEPs) in response to 6 Hz periodic breaks in collinearity (Vernier offsets) in horizontal squarewave gratings. Vernier thresholds, estimated by extrapolating the amplitude of the first harmonic (1F) to 0 µV, were measured for gratings with 4%, 8%, 16%, 32%, 64%, and 80% contrast, with gaps of 0, 2, or 5 arcmin introduced between neighboring bar elements that formed the Vernier offsets. Thresholds for the 2F response component provided an estimate of motion thresholds. The data confirmed and extended evidence that the odd- and even-harmonic components reflect cortical activity of different neurons (i.e., neurons that respond asymmetrically to the periodic breaks in alignment and neurons that respond symmetrically to the local relative motion cue of the stimulus). Suprathreshold data (peak amplitude, response slope, and response phase at the peak amplitude) provided additional independent evidence of this notion. Vernier thresholds decreased linearly as contrast increased, with a slope of approximately -0.5 on log-log axes, similar to prior psychophysical results. The form of contrast dependence showed more similarity to measures of magnocellular ganglion cell spatial precision than measures from parvocellular ganglion cells. Our data thus support the hypothesis that magnocellular ganglion cell output from the retina has the requisite properties to support cortical calculation of Vernier offsets at a hyperacuity level."

We sought to determine whether inhibition and impulsivity were related to genetic polymorphisms in the DRD2 gene (DRD2) in healthy volunteers (N = 93). Participants received placebo or d-amphetamine in random order. They performed the stop task, measuring behavioral inhibition, and rated their mood states on each session. They also completed the Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire, including an Impulsivity subscale. We investigated the association between 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in DRD2 and stop task performance in the nondrug (i.e., placebo) session and on the personality measure of impulsivity. We secondarily evaluated the DRD2 SNPs in relation to response to d-amphetamine on stop task performance and mood ratings. Mood was not related to genotypes in either the drug free condition or in response to drug. However, 2 SNPs, rs4648317 and rs12364283, and a haplotype block consisting of those SNPs, were associated with better performance on the stop task in the drug free condition and lower scores on the Impulsivity subscale. We also found that rs12364283 was associated with effects of d-amphetamine on stop task performance: d-amphetamine decreased stop reaction time (RT) in the A/A group but increased stop RT in the combined A/G + G/G genotype. Of the SNPs we evaluated, rs12364283, which has been associated with DRD2 expression, was the most significantly associated with inhibition and impulsivity. The significant relationship between DRD2 genotype and both behavioral inhibition and impulsivity suggests a possible common genetic influence on behavioral and self-report measures of impulsivity."

These spontaneous trait inferences (STIs) can occur without intention or awareness. All research on STIs has studied STIs based on behaviors of individual persons. Yet important aspects of social life occur in groups, and people regularly perceive groups engaging in coordinated action. We propose that perceivers make spontaneous trait inferences about groups (STIGs), parallel to the STIs formed about individuals. In 5 experiments we showed that (a) perceivers made STIGs comparable with STIs about individuals (based on the same behaviors), (b) a cognitive load manipulation did not affect the occurrence of STIGs, (c) STIGs occurred for groups varying in entitativity, (d) STIGs influenced perceivers' impression ratings of those groups, and (e) STIG-based group impressions generalized to new group members. These experiments provide the first evidence for STIGs, a process that may contribute to the formation of spontaneous group impressions. Implications for stereotype formation are discussed.

Four issues were examined: the acquisition of phonological knowledge prior to reading, how this knowledge facilitates learning to read, phonological and non phonological bases of dyslexia, and effects of literacy on phonological representation. Compared with simple feedforward networks, representing phonological knowledge in an attractor network yielded improved learning and generalization. Phonological and surface forms of developmental dyslexia, which are usually attributed to impairments in distinct lexical and nonlexical processing “routes,” were derived from different types of damage to the network. The results provide a computationally explicit account of many aspects of reading acquisition using connectionist principles. Phonological information plays a central role in learning to read and in skilled reading. Several converging sources of evidence indicate that learning to relate the spoken and written forms of language is a critical step in learning to read (see Adams, 1990, for an extensive review). Children’ s knowledge of the phonological structure of language is a good predictor of early reading ability (Bradley & Bryant, 1983; Tunmer & Nesdale, 1985; Mann, 1984; Olson, Wise, Conners, Rack, & Fulker, 1989; Shankweiler & Liberman, 1989) and impairments in the representation or processing of phonological information are implicated in at least some forms of developmental dyslexia (Manis, Seidenberg, Doi, McBride-Chang, & Peterson, 1996; Stanovich, Siegel, & Gottardo, 1997).

Four experiments showed that RB is observed for word-nonword pairs (noon noof), orthographically similar nonwords (glome glame), and identical repetitions (plass plass). More RB was found for words than for nonwords.

START,START,2169694427,the impact of sleep deprivation on decision making a review,2000,"yvonne harrison, j a horne",journal of experimental psychology applied,1,775,95,"Few sleep deprivation (SD) studies involve realism or high-level decision making, factors relevant to managers, military commanders, and so forth, who are undergoing prolonged work during crises. Instead, research has favored simple tasks sensitive to SD mostly because of their dull monotony. In contrast, complex rule-based, convergent, and logical tasks are unaffected by short-term SD, seemingly because of heightened participant interest and compensatory effort. However, recent findings show that despite this effort, SD still impairs decision making involving the unexpected, innovation, revising plans, competing distraction, and effective communication. Decision-making models developed outside SD provide useful perspectives on these latter effects, as does a neuropsychological explanation of sleep function. SD presents particular difficulties for sleep-deprived decision makers who require these latter skills during emergency situations. Most of the studies that examine the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) on behavior and psychological performance have concentrated on measures deemed sensitive to ""sleepiness,"" favoring more basic skills, such as vigilance, reaction time, and aspects of memory (cf. the recent review by Pilcher & Huffcutt, 1996). These tests are usually combined with monotony and lack of environmental stimulation, which, taken together, produce optimum conditions for maximizing the adverse effects of SD. Such monotony is further facilitated by the need to ensure that participants are well trained in the test procedures beforehand to minimize practice effects. The extent to which these more conventional laboratory-based tests relate to real-world tasks is a matter for debate. A good illustration, and an example attracting much attention, concerns junior hospital doctors (interns) who experience SD with long working hours on a routine basis. Much of the SD research, as of this writing, has focused on cognitive processes that have little to do with the true nature of the job or normal working duties (e.g., serial reaction time, vigilance). Sometimes, the overall picture can be confusing, with findings showing no impairments for certain clinical skills and concurrent deterioration in psychological performance tasks of unknown relevance to these and other medical skills.

Further, the authors predicted and found that individual differences in attachment style moderate the defenses. In Studies 1 and 2, attachment threats motivated worldview defense among anxiously attached participants and motivated self-enhancement (especially among avoidant participants), effects similar to those caused by mortality salience.

In the visuospatial priming (VSP) task, key press latency is facilitated or inhibited, depending on the spatial location of a priming cue. In the Stroop task, participants name the ink color of printed words that have an interfering semantic value. OCD participants displayed significantly slowed baseline response latency and increased facilitory priming scores in the VSP task, with no significant difference in VSP inhibition compared with control participants. Higher interference cost in the Stroop task was also observed in OCD participants. Clinical associations between VSP and Stroop performance and specific OCD symptoms were examined.

The present studies examine several aspects and consequences of the process of reading traits from faces. Using faces with neutral expressions, it is demonstrated that personality information conveyed in faces changes the interpretation of verbal information. Moreover, it is shown that physiognomic information has a consistent effect on decisions, and creates overconfidence in judgments. It is argued, however, that the process of ""reading from faces"" is just one side of the coin, the other side of which is ""reading into faces."" Consistent with the latter, information about personality changes the perception of facial features and, accordingly, the perceived similarity between faces. The implications of both processes and questions regarding their automaticity are discussed. There are some people whose faces bear the stamp of such artless vulgarity and baseness of character, such an animal limitation of intelligence, that one wonders how they can appear in public with such a countenance, instead of wearing a mask.

Together, these 4 factors account for 83% of the variability in overall recall accuracy, suggesting they provide a nearly complete picture of recall dynamics. We also show that these sources of variability account for over 80% of the variance shared between memory and intelligence.

In many tasks performance is measured by differences (costs) between conditions, which are widely assumed to index a psychological process of interest rather than extraneous factors such as speed-accuracy trade-offs (e.g. Stroop, Implicit Association Task, lexical decision, antisaccade, Simon, Navon, flanker and Task Switching). Relatedly, RT costs or error costs are interpreted similarly and used interchangeably in the literature. All of this assumes a strong correlation between RT-costs and error-costs from the same psychological effect. We conducted a meta-analysis to test this, with 114 effects across a range of well-known tasks. Counterintuitively, we found a general pattern of weak, and often no, association between RT and error costs (mean R=.17, range -.45 to .78). This general problem is accounted for by the theoretical framework of evidence accumulation models, which capture individual differences in (at least) two distinct ways. Differences affecting accumulation rate produce positive correlation. But this is cancelled out if individuals also differ in response threshold, which produces negative correlations. In the models, subtractions between conditions do not isolate processing costs from caution. To demonstrate the explanatory power of synthesising the traditional subtraction method within a broader decision model framework, we confirm two predictions with new data. Thus, using error costs or RT costs is more than a pragmatic choice; the decision carries theoretical consequence that can be understood through the accumulation model framework."

In Experiment 1a, 22 early deaf adults and 23 hearing controls performed a peripheral shape-discrimination task, while uninformative central gaze cues validly and invalidly cued the location of the target. As an adaptation to the lack of audition, we expected deaf adults to show a larger impact of gaze cuing on attentional orienting compared with hearing controls. However, contrary to our predictions, deaf participants did not respond faster to cued compared with uncued targets (gaze-cuing effect; GCE), and this behavior partly correlated with early sign language acquisition. Experiment 1b showed a reliable GCE in 13 hearing native signers, thus excluding a key role of early sign language acquisition in explaining the lack of GCE in the response times of deaf participants. To test whether the resistance to uninformative central cues extends to nonsocial cues, in Experiment 2 nonpredictive arrow cues were presented to 14 deaf and 14 hearing participants. Both groups of participants showed a comparable arrow-cuing effect. Together, our findings suggest that deafness may selectively limit attentional-orienting triggered by central irrelevant gaze cues.

In typically developing children, the activation in the bilateral superior temporal cortices was attenuated to the second presentation of the same word. In SLI children, this repetition effect was nearly nonexistent in the left hemisphere. Furthermore, the activation was equally strong to words and pseudowords in SLI children whereas in the typically developing children the left hemisphere activation persisted longer for pseudowords than words. Our results indicate that the short-term maintenance of linguistic activation that underlies spoken word recognition is defective in SLI particularly in the left language-dominant hemisphere.

Results revealed a repetition effect both within languages and between languages. Furthermore, there was an asymmetry within language, with repetition priming being larger in Spanish than in English. Experiments 2 and 3 revealed that lag interacted with language for both within- and between-language priming. However, lag resulted in a decrease in the asymmetry for within- but not between-language priming. The results are consistent with the view that within- and between-language repetition priming are mediated by different mechanisms."

Participants were preschool children whose first language was either Spanish (n = 45) or Tamazight ( n = 52), a Berber dialect spoken in Morocco’s Rif area. The two-year pretest/posttest study showed that the children who received phonological training with or without music performed significantly better in a naming speed posttest and a series of phonological processing tasks than those who did not participate in specialized training. The phonological training that included music activities was particularly effective for the development of phonological awareness of ending sounds and naming speed. The benefits of the training on children’s phonological awareness and naming speed, two strong predictors of reading acquisition, were significant regardless of the native language of the children."

A structural equation model for the latent change scores showed that changes in speed and working memory predicted changes in episodic memory, as expected by processing resource theory.

Dissociations were detected between cross-sectional ability correlations and longitudinal changes.

START,START,2625496658,gaze behavior to faces during dyadic interaction,2017,"roy s hessels, tim cornelissen, ignace t c hooge, chantal kemner",canadian journal of experimental psychology,1,6,0,"Imagine the following scenario: You are walking through a crowded square, and each person you walk by looks at you with disgust. You begin to worry-Did I spill my morning coffee on my shirt? Is there some toothpaste on my face? By processing information in the faces of others, you infer that something is wrong. In this case, the direction of a person's gaze combined with the emotion portrayed were enough for you to question what you did wrong this morning (see also Gallup, Chong, Kacelnik, Krebs, & Couzin, 2014). But the information contained in faces is not limited to emotion and gaze direction. One may infer someone's identity from the face, and possibly even someone's mental state (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, & Plumb, 2001). Given the amount of information faces can provide, it may be unsurprising that faces tend to attract (Gliga, Elsabbagh, Andravizou, & Johnson, 2009; Langton, Law, Burton, & Schweinberger, 2008) and retain (Bindemann, Burton, Hooge, Jenkins, & de Haan, 2005) our attention. Even newborn infants who are just a few minutes old preferentially follow face-like patterns (Goren, Sarty, & Wu, 1975; Johnson, Dziurawiec, Ellis, & Morton, 1991). Faces are, apparently, something special.Since the pioneering work of Yarbus (1967), researchers have tried to figure out what information humans collect from the faces of others, by investigating eye movements during the exploration of faces. A consistent finding has been that there is a preference for fixating the eye region of faces. This has been suggested to be because of the amount of information that can be extracted solely from the eyes. For example, the eye region is crucial for determining the direction of another's gaze (Langton, Watt, & Bruce, 2000). The eye region was also most often fixated when participants had to learn a set of faces, supporting the notion of the eyes as primary source of information (Henderson, Williams, & Falk, 2005). Interestingly, Birmingham, Bischof, and Kingstone (2009) reported that this preference for the eyes is irrespective of saliency according to the computational model by Itti and Koch (2000), refuting the idea that facial features are selected based purely on stimulus characteristics.Are the eyes, then, indeed the primary source of information in faces? Vo, Smith, Mital, and Henderson (2012) proposed an information-processing account of gaze behaviour to faces. They presented videos portraying people in various settings. When the person portrayed looked straight into the camera, there was a preference for fixating the eyes. When the person portrayed spoke, however, the mouth was most often fixated. Vo et al. proposed that facial features are fixated based on the amount of information they can provide at a given time. Previous findings in line with this proposal are reported by Birmingham, Bischof, and Kingstone (2008a), who showed that although the eyes of people in social scenes are preferentially fixated, the eyes may be fixated more based on the task required. In their study, people fixated the eyes even more when the direction of people's gaze had to be determined-which, although an intuitive finding, suggests that the context of the scene plays an important role. In a second study, Birmingham, Bischof, and Kingstone (2008b) showed that the social content of the scene may modulate the amount of time spent fixating the eyes. When the number of people increased in the scene, more time was spent looking at the eye regions. Interestingly, when a group of people portrayed active interaction (e.g., playing a game) versus inactivity, the time spent looking at the eye regions increased even more. Social context and task demands thus appear to play an important role in where information is collected in a face.Despite the apparent importance of social context, most studies have employed pictures of faces or social scenes, thereby ignoring the possible dynamics in gaze behaviour when social partners are physically present (Risko, Laidlaw, Freeth, Foulsham, & Kingstone, 2012). …"

Narcissism seemed to divide into two different styles, a ""phallic,"" grandiose style and a narcissistically vulnerable style. Shame primarily accounted for the differences in these styles, correlating negatively with the grandiose style, positively with the more vulnerable style. The narcissistically vulnerable style correlated more with the core pathology measures; that is, object relations and masochism. Social desirability did not mediate the relationship between grandiose narcissism and shame. Only small univariate gender differences were found, but masochism was a better predictor of shame in women than was narcissism whereas there was little difference between masochism and narcissism for predicting shame in men."

Casey Foundation, 2004). Nearly one in five children in the United States live in poverty and experience the multiple, layered risks associated with poor homes and poor communities (Evans, 2004; U.S. Census Bureau, 2002). As a result of widespread risk conditions and low access to preventive or remedial mental health services, approximately 20% of children living in the United States have a diagnosable mental disorder, and 9% to 13% of children have severe emotional disorders that impair their functioning at home or school (Friedman, Katz-Leavy, Manderscheid, & Sondheimer, 1996). Consequently, at least 25% of children in the United States are at serious risk of not achieving “productive adulthood” (National Research Council, 1993).

These statistics on population-level risk among youth, combined with a rapidly expanding array of empirically supported mental health prevention programs, have led to renewed calls for an increased emphasis on deploying empirically supported prevention programs into children’s natural settings. The Surgeon General’s National Action Agenda for Children’s Mental Health (U.S. Public Health Service, 2002) has recommended that prevention programs be embedded into schools and other child-serving institutions, and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has targeted significant resources toward efforts to disseminate such programs into schools and other community settings. As school psychologists increasingly move into prevention and public health–oriented roles (Cummings et al., 2004; Durlak, 1995; Greenberg, Domitrovic, & Bumbarger, 2001; Hoagwood & Johnson, 2003), they experience the need for brief, reliable, and valid measures of behavioral and emotional adjustment that can be used in epidemiological and prevention research.

This study provides evidence of the psychometric properties of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 2000), a measure recently included by NIMH as its epidemiological screener in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; NIMH, 2002, 2003, 2004). A brief screening instrument that teachers and parents can complete on all students would be of particular value to school psychologists who adopt a prevention-oriented, public health orientation to practice (Hoagwood & Johnson, 2003)."

Abstract
Participants conflate consent and wantedness when judging situations as rape (Peterson & Muehlenhard, 2007). Pleasure might also affect how such situations might be appraised by victims, perpetrators, and jurors. In four experiments, participants read vignettes describing sexual encounters that were consensual or not, wanted or unwanted, and pleasurable or not pleasurable. Participants judged whether they thought each situation described rape and how distressing they thought the encounter would be. Wantedness affected perceived distress when consent was given. Wantedness and pleasure also influenced whether participants considered the situation rape in non-consensual scenarios. In additional experiments, we analysed the results by gender, manipulated perspective (being the subject or initiator of the encounter), levels of aggression, and compared the results to a group of participants who had viewed an anti-abuse campaign. Male participants and those higher in benevolent sexism were more likely than women to utilise pleasure and wantedness in judging whether situations described rape. Perspective and viewing the media campaign did not significantly affect judgements of rape. Our results have implications for models of the consequences of consent, wantedness, and pleasure of sex, and important implications for educational programmes aimed at reducing sexual assault and training for those involved in criminal justice."

The authors demonstrate that conditional directives are distinct from indicative conditionals in which speakers predict what is likely to be observed should certain events occur. The 1st set of experiments shows that goal structure determines what information speakers will select to test whether conditional directives have been followed but that these selections do not reflect their interpretations of the deontic necessity and sufficiency of the conditional relation. The 2nd set of experiments shows that formulations of conditional directives differ in how clearly speakers consider them to express their situation-specific intentions and that hearers accurately perceive what speakers intend them to do as a result of these formulations. The authors' findings illustrate a form of social rationality common in everyday interaction, which broadens normative conceptions of conditionals."

To clarify these inconsistencies we report a 6-year longitudinal study (starting at Age 4 years) where we control for measurement error and track the development and interrelationships between a range of predictors of reading comprehension (language, decoding, and cognitive skills). We found two main pathways to reading comprehension: a highly stable language comprehension pathway (reflecting variations in vocabulary, listening comprehension, grammar, and verbal working memory) and a less stable code-related pathway (reflecting variations in phoneme awareness, letter knowledge, and rapid automatized naming). Early language comprehension at Age 4 years is strongly related to code-related predictors (phoneme awareness, letter knowledge, and rapid naming), and influences decoding indirectly through these constructs. Early oral language skills predicted initial levels of reading comprehension and its growth between the ages of 7 and 9 years. Strikingly, language comprehension and decoding, together with their interaction and curvilinear effects, explain almost all (99.7%) of the variance in reading comprehension skills at 7 years of age. Our study adds to prior knowledge in several important ways and provides strong support for an elaborated version of the simple view of reading (Gough & Tunmer, 1986).

El presente estudio investigo la existencia de deficits cognitivos especificos que incidan en la lectura y se asocien a la dislexia evolutiva en una lengua no alfabetica: el chino. Tambien se examino el patron de comorbilidad entre varios desordenes evolutivos. Participaron del estudio 106 ninos chinos con diversos tipos de desordenes evolutivos o dificultades de aprendizaje que incluian dislexia evolutiva (DYS), desorden de deficit atencional/hiperactividad (ADHD), desorden de coordinacion evolutiva (DCD) e inteligencia borderline (BI). Se aplicaron pruebas de lectoescritura, denominacion rapida, habilidades de procesamiento fonologicas, ortograficas y visuales.

Die meisten zuruckliegenden Forschungserkenntnisse vermuten, dass ein phonologisches Defizit einzigartig der Entwicklungsdyslexia anhaftet, insofern alphabethische Sprachen betroffen sind. Die vorliegende Studie untersuchte die Existenz von moglichen, ahnlichen lesebezogenen kognitiven Defiziten, assoziiert mit Entwicklungsdyslexia bei einer nichtalphabethischen Schrift, Chinesisch. Die Muster uber Koerkrankung unter verschiedenen Entwicklungsstorungen wurden ebenfalls untersucht. 106 chinesische Kinder mit unterschiedlichen Arten von Entwicklungsstorungen, einschlieslich Entwicklungsdyslexia (DYS), Aufmerksamkeitsdefizit/Hyperaktivitatsstorung (ADHD), Entwicklungskoordinierungsstorung (DCD), und begrenzter Intelligenz (BI) wurden auf ihren Bildungsgrad im Lesen und Schreiben, dem schnellen Benennen, phonologischer, orthographischer und visueller Verarbeitungsfahigkeiten gepruft. Es wurde festgestellt, das (a) die Koerkrankungsanteile unter diesen Entwicklungsstorungen hoch waren; (b) die reine DYS-Gruppe am meisten im schnellen Benennen und bei der orthographischen Verarbeitung benachteiligt war und diese leistete wesentlich Schlechteres als andere “reine” Gruppen; (c) die ausschlieslich ADHD und ausschlieslich DCD Gruppen sehr Nahe dem durchschnittlich-normalen Bereich im Lesen und Schreiben und auf kognitiven Gebieten kamen; und (d) das kognitive Profil der DYS+ADHD Gruppen dem der reinen DYS Gruppe glich, wahrend das der DYS+DCD Gruppen einigen Charakteristiken von den beiden “reinen” Gruppen glich. Die Autoren schliesen daraus, dass ein rapides Benennungsdefizit und orthographisches Defizit eindeutig einzigartige Defizitsmarkierungen der Entwicklungsdyslexia im Chinesischen sind, wahrend Kinder mit ADHD oder DCD weniger benachteiligt in schriftlicher Bildung und auf lesebezogenen, kognitiven Gebieten sind. Auswirkungen fur auszubildende und klinische Anwendungen werden ebenfalls diskutiert.

Twenty Chinese dyslexic children in Hong Kong were compared with 20 average readers of the same age (CA controls) and 20 average readers of the same reading level (RL controls) in naming speed (naming digits, colours, pictures, and Chinese characters) and phonological memory skills (digit repetition, word repetition, and nonword repetition). The results showed that the naming speed of Chinese dyslexic children was significantly slower than that of their CA controls in all the naming tasks, but similar to that of their RL controls. The dyslexic children also performed significantly worse than both CA and RL controls in all the phonological memory tasks. These findings suggest that Chinese dyslexic children have naming-speed deficits and phonological memory deficits like their alphabetic counterparts."

The present study examined the adequacy of an extended SVR in Chinese. Participants were 190 pairs of Chinese twin children of Grades 1–3 recruited in Hong Kong. The children were given Chinese measures of decoding (character reading, word reading, and 1-min word reading), linguistic comprehension (morphological awareness, vocabulary, morphosyntactic skills, and discourse skills), rapid naming (Chinese digits, English digits, and English letters), and passage reading comprehension (with multiple-choice and open-ended questions). Results of structural equation modeling showed that the direct paths from decoding and linguistic comprehension to reading comprehension were significant, but that from rapid naming was not. For the role of rapid naming in reading comprehension, the best fitting model showed that the contribution of rapid naming to reading comprehension was fully mediated by decoding. The model explained a total of 83% of the variance in reading comprehension. Therefore, the present findings support the SVR in a Chinese writing system; rapid naming may reflect some basic visual-verbal learning ability which is important for acquiring word recognition skills."

We examined the utility of behavioral (standardized tests), and functional and structural neuroimaging measures taken with children at the beginning of a school year for predicting their decoding ability at the end of that school year. Specific patterns of brain activation during phonological processing and morphology, as revealed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray and white matter densities, predicted later decoding ability. Further, a model combining behavioral and neuroimaging measures predicted decoding outcome significantly better than either behavioral or neuroimaging models alone. Results were validated using cross-validation methods. These findings suggest that neuroimaging methods may be useful in enhancing the early identification of children at risk for poor decoding and reading skills."

A complete model must also account for the representation of concrete and abstract words, of taxonomic and associative relationships, and for the role of context in shaping meaning. We present the first major attempt to assimilate all of these elements within a unified, implemented computational framework. Our model combines a hub-and-spoke architecture with a buffer that allows its state to be influenced by prior context. This hybrid structure integrates the view, from cognitive neuroscience, that concepts are grounded in sensory-motor representation with the view, from computational linguistics, that knowledge is shaped by patterns of lexical co-occurrence. The model successfully codes knowledge for abstract and concrete words, associative and taxonomic relationships, and the multiple meanings of homonyms, within a single representational space. Knowledge of abstract words is acquired through (a) their patterns of co-occurrence with other words and (b) acquired embodiment, whereby they become indirectly associated with the perceptual features of co-occurring concrete words. The model accounts for executive influences on semantics by including a controlled retrieval mechanism that provides top-down input to amplify weak semantic relationships. The representational and control elements of the model can be damaged independently, and the consequences of such damage closely replicate effects seen in neuropsychological patients with loss of semantic representation versus control processes. Thus, the model provides a wide-ranging and neurally plausible account of normal and impaired semantic cognition."

However, virtually no work has investigated how the most basic and broad indicator of relationship quality, relationship satisfaction, affects self-regulation and vice versa. In the present research, we show that higher relationship satisfaction promotes a motivational mind-set that is conducive for effective self-regulation, and thus for goal progress and performance. In Study 1-a large-scale, intensive experience sampling project of 115 couples (total N = 230)-we closely tracked fluctuations in state relationship satisfaction (SRS) and 4 parameters of effective self-regulation according to our conceptual model. Dyadic process analyses showed that individuals experiencing higher SRS than they typically do exhibited higher levels of (a) perceived control, (b) goal focus, (c) perceived partner support, and (d) positive affect during goal pursuit than they typically exhibit. Together, these 4 self-regulation-relevant variables translated into higher rates of daily progress on specific, idiographic goals. In Study 2 (N = 195), we employed a novel experimental manipulation of SRS, replicating the link between SRS and parameters of effective self-regulation. Taken together, these findings suggest that momentary increases in relationship satisfaction may benefit everyday goal pursuit through a combination of cognitive and affective mechanisms, thus further integrating relationship research with social-cognitive research on goal pursuit.

The study extends previous research in suggesting that individuals use moral concepts differently as they cycle through periods of consolidation and transition. With multiple cross-sectional and longitudinal samples, findings indicate that participants' reliance on a Kohlbergian moral framework as measured by the Defining Issues Test is highest during periods of consolidation and lowest during transitions. As participants move into periods of consolidation, the utility of moral stage information increases. Thus, this study indicates that the consolidation and transition model can be used to help identify individuals who are more or less likely to use Kohlberg's moral stages in their moral decision making."

In some studies, small proportions are overestimated and large proportions underestimated; in other studies, the reverse pattern occurs. Sometimes the bias pattern repeats cyclically with a higher frequency (e.g., overestimation of proportions less than .25 and between .5 and .75; underestimation otherwise). To account for the various bias patterns, a cyclical power model was derived from Stevens' power law. The model proposes that the amplitude of the bias pattern is determined by the Stevens exponent, β (i.e., the stimulus continuum being judged), and that the frequency of the pattern is determined by a choice of intermediate reference points in the stimulus. When β NA NA 1, the under-then-over pattern is predicted. Two experiments confirming the model's assumptions are described. A mixed-cycle version of the model is also proposed that predicts observed asymmetries in bias patterns when the set of reference points varies across trials."

However, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) and Lyme disease, each for a different reason, remain exceptions. In the era of effective antiretroviral therapies, HIV has become a chronic illness. Children born with HIV face different stresses when compared to adolescents who acquire HIV through risky behavior. This chapter will provide a discussion of various mental health problems that accompany or mimic conditions associated with HIV infection that providers are likely to encounter when caring for children with HIV. Lyme disease is an acute illness with excellent prognosis when treated appropriately. Unfortunately, misleading information available on the Internet has fueled false beliefs about Lyme disease diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. As a result, we have encountered a growing number of older children and adolescents with so-called chronic Lyme disease or post-Lyme disease syndrome. Because their definitions remain elusive, patients with subjective complaints often are diagnosed with Lyme disease. Proper knowledge of clinical manifestations of Lyme disease and interpretation of Lyme serology testing are paramount to prevention of unnecessary and misleading interventions.

Previous demonstrations of this effect have occurred solely in a single-category paradigm in which transfer patterns are assigned or not to the learning category. We tested the hypothesis that any extraneous variable potentially responsible for this effect, such as compactness varying with pattern distortion (Zaki & Nosofsky, 2004), may be functional in the single-category paradigm but not when multiple categories are available at the time of transfer. In the present study, subjects received a bogus or a real category learning phase, followed by a transfer test that required assignment into 1 or 3 prototype categories. The results showed that a minimal prototype gradient was obtained in the bogus conditions, with performance approaching chance levels when classification into 3 categories was required. In contrast, a substantial prototype gradient effect was found following learning. We conclude that the prototype gradient typically obtained following multiple-category learning is primarily driven by real learning and that the false prototype effect is itself an artifact of the single-category paradigm.

The article is divided into two sections. First, it is shown that, with its attention to the unconscious, to the past and its disguised repetition, psychoanalysis is especially attuned to the displaced routes of colonial desire after the end of official colonial (or apartheid) rule. The second section then considers Frantz Fanon’s strategic deployment of psychoanalysis, focusing on the way Fanon reworked key psychoanalytic concepts in Black Skin, White Masks, emphasizing what he referred to as “sociogeny,” the way colonial neuroses are produced out of an internalization—or “epidermalization” in Fanon’s terms—of racist social structure. The argument made is that psychoanalysis must, if it is to be a part of a critical frame for postcolonial subjectivities, be rendered not only instrument but also object of analysis, a part of the very social structure toward which Fanon shifted his attention. Psychoanalysis is adept at throwing into relief repetitions of the colonial past. Nonetheless, psychoanalytic thinking, pervasive in a postapartheid context—that is, not simply at the isolated level of clinical or scholarly practice, but as a discursive lens for engagements with the South African national past, as exemplified in the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission—emerges as itself a particular kind of acting out the colonial past at an epistemological level"

The current study explored the effects of CCT on positive reappraisal ability in a lab context, and deployment and efficacy of positive appraisal and rumination in daily life. A sample of undergraduates (n = 83) was allocated to CCT or an active control condition, performing 10 online training sessions over a period of 14 days.

Results revealed a positive association between baseline cognitive control and self-reported use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies, whereas maladaptive emotion regulation strategies showed a negative association. CCT showed transfer to working memory functioning on the dual n-back task. Overall, effects of CCT on emotion regulation were limited to reducing deployment of rumination in low positive affective states. However, we did not find beneficial effects on indicators of adaptive emotion regulation. These findings are in line with previous studies targeting maladaptive emotion regulation but suggest limited use in enhancing adaptive emotion regulation in a healthy sample.

Positive effects of embodiment emerged regardless of whether transgressions were committed by a collective (Studies 1, 2, and 6) or an individual (Studies 3-5), and were equally strong regardless of whether or not the transgressor issued an apology (Studies 4 and 5). Furthermore, embodied remorse appeared to lie beyond suspicion: if anything, those low in dispositional trust were more positively influenced by embodied remorse than those high in dispositional trust. Despite all these positive effects, embodied remorse did not have a significant effect on forgiveness in any of the studies, and an internal meta-analysis revealed a significant effect that was of negligible size.

Previous studies have shown that RAN is an independent and robust predictor for reading skills in children. Less research investigated the incremental contributions of distinct RAN measures to reading skills in beginning readers. Ninety-three children from kindergarten and first grade completed four different RAN measures involving color, digit, vowel, and consonant naming at the end of the school year. Six months later these children were either in first or in second grade and completed several reading measures. The results emphasize that vowel RAN was a strong and unique predictor for reading accuracy in first grade. Vowel RAN and digit RAN were both significant predictors for reading speed in second grade. The current findings underline that vowel RAN is a promising predictor for reading outcomes (i.e., accuracy and speed) at the beginning of elementary school. RAN performance did however not significantly predict second grade reading comprehension. Results and practical implications will be discussed."

In a first step, we examined the structure of rapid automatized naming (RAN) performance from a general cognitive perspective. We investigated whether rapid naming measures (e.g., digit RAN, color RAN) reflect a mainly domain-general factor or domain-specific factors. In a second step we examined how the best fitting RAN model was related to reading and arithmetic outcomes, assessed several months later. Finally in a third step we took a clinical perspective and investigated specific contributions of RAN measures to reading and arithmetic outcomes. While RAN has emerged as a promising predictor of reading, the relationship between RAN and arithmetic has been less examined in the past. Hundred and twenty-two first graders completed seven RAN tasks, each comprising visually familiar stimuli such as digits, vowels, consonants, dice, finger numeral configurations, objects and colors. Four months later the same children completed a range of reading and arithmetic tasks. From a general cognitive perspective, structural equation modeling supports a one-dimensional RAN factor in 6-to-7-year-old children. However, from a clinical perspective, our findings emphasize the specific contributions of RANs. Interestingly, alphanumeric RANs (i.e., vowel RAN) were most promising when predicting reading skills and number-specific RANs (i.e., finger numeral configuration RAN) were most promising when predicting arithmetic fluency. The implications for clinical and educational practices will be discussed."

METHOD: Over 4 months, 60 informal caregivers from New Zealand participated in online discussion boards that provided a set of virtual forums. It drew upon the Capability Approach (Sen, 1980) to frame a qualitative inquiry whereby participants could anonymously respond to an evolving joint discussion of their health needs. Template analysis based on Nussbaum's (2007) list of essential human capabilities informed the thematic analysis. RESULTS: The results showed the interconnected nature of capabilities and the importance of emotions in informal caregiving. Emotional attachment influenced the caregivers' freedom to choose how they lived their lives. Because they valued the capability to care for loved ones, the caregivers traded other capabilities, putting their lives on hold, and compromising their wellbeing. CONCLUSION: The self-abnegation reported by the caregivers highlighted the relational nature of caregiving and challenged a dominant perspective in the caregiving literature that focuses on the burdens of caregiving. The significance of emotional aspects related to the valued capabilities of caregiving suggests the need to acknowledge caregiving as an interdependent relationship and emotions as a crucial place to focus future support for caregivers."

The most consistent positive effects have been reported for executive functions associated with frontal brain regions. In rodents, however, running has been shown to induce functional and structural changes in the hippocampus, a brain region known to be important for memory. It is still a matter of debate which cognitive functions are susceptible to exercise and whether an increase in cardiovascular fitness is beneficial for cognitive functioning. Moreover, little is known about the impact of exercise on cognition in middle-aged humans. Method: Sixty-eight sedentary men and women between 40 and 56 years of age were randomly assigned to one of two training programs: aerobic endurance training (cycling) or nonendurance training (stretching/coordination). Both groups exercised twice a week for six months. Additionally, a sedentary control group was tested. At baseline and after six months, episodic memory, perceptual speed, executive functions, and spatial reasoning were assessed with standardized psychometric tests, and all participants underwent a cardiovascular fitness test. Results: Significant improvements in memory were observed in both the cycling and the stretching/ coordination group as compared with the sedentary control group. The improvement in episodic memory correlated positively with the increase in cardiovascular fitness. The stretching/coordination training particularly improved selective attention as compared with the cycling training. Conclusions: The results suggest that cardiovascular fitness has beneficial effects even in high-functioning middle-aged participants, but that these benefits are very specific to memory functions rather than a wider range of cognitive functions."

In 169 Grade 6 children, ANRAN uniquely influenced MGR (accuracy/efficiency), with NANRAN influencing only GOK efficiency. ANRAN/NANRAN influenced word reading efficiency directly/indirectly through MGR efficiency. We observed similar direct/indirect effects on word reading accuracy from ANRAN and MGR accuracy but only indirect influence from NANRAN through MGR accuracy. Further analyses indicated that RAN and OK relate reciprocally when influencing word reading.

Researchers have demonstrated that early language difficulties may lead to later reading impairments and several decades of research has convincingly demonstrated that rapid automatized naming is a powerful predictor of concurrent and future reading development. As a result, researchers have argued that naming and reading tasks involve some shared cognitive processes. Language and reading deficits have implications for academic success and selfesteem, particularly during childhood. Hence, the identification of children at-risk for developing reading impairments is an important task for educators and clinicians. Debates still exist about whether rapid naming difficulties reflect simple delays in language acquisition resulting from processing speed and/or attention problems or are suggestive of abnormalities in underlying cognitive processes. While the co-occurrence of rapid naming deficits and reading impairments is well established in the literature, few studies have explored the presence of Dysnomia without reading impairment. The current study examined the nature of expressive language deficits for Dysnomic children with and without impaired reading by incorporating multiple neuropsychological measures. In a sample of children (N=104) between the ages of 6 and 12 years, performance differences were specifically investigated on measures of verbal fluency, confrontation naming, and rapid naming, as well as visual and verbal sequential memory.

When people make predictions or choices, they are often in the joint evaluation (JE) mode; when people actually experience an event, they are often in the single evaluation (SE) mode. The “utility function” of an attribute can vary systematically between SE and JE. When people in JE make predictions or choices for events to be experienced in SE, they often resort to their JE preferences rather than their SE preferences and overpredict the difference that different values of an attribute (e.g., different salaries) will make to their happiness in SE. This overprediction is referred to as the distinction bias. The present research also specifies when the distinction bias occurs and when it does not. This research contributes to literatures on experienced utility, affective forecasting, and happiness. Suppose that a person is faced with two job offers. She finds one job interesting and the other tedious. However, the interesting job will pay her only $60,000 a year, and the tedious job will pay her $70,000 a year. The person wants to choose the job that will give her the greatest overall happiness. To make that choice, she tries to predict the difference in happiness between earning $60,000 a year and earning $70,000 a year and also predict the difference in happiness between doing the interesting job and doing the tedious job. Is she able to make these predictions accurately? Is she able to choose the job that will indeed bring her the greater overall happiness?"

Reader response and socio-cultural theories were the theoretical perspectives that underpin this study. Four bilingual picture books were selected for the five participating Chinese children to read during an eight-week period. The researchers specifically sought answers to two questions: (1) How do Chinese children respond to the bilingual books? (2) What impact do the bilingual book study sessions have on children's bilingual and biliteracy development? The findings suggested these children responded positively by becoming engaged, making connections, activating cultural and background knowledge, and showing unnoticed talent. In addition, bilingual books, combined with appropriate instruction, can be a powerful resource to promote bilingual and biliteracy development.(ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted.)Exploring Bilingual Books with Five Chinese First Graders: Children's Responses and Biliteracy DevelopmentResearch has shown that high quality multicultural literature not only enhances children's awareness of diversity in the world, but also ensures a sense of belongingness when children of diverse cultural and language backgrounds see themselves represented (Reddish, 2000; Salas, Lucido, & Canales, 2001; Walker, Edwards, & Blackseil, 1996). As one type of multicultural literature, bilingual books have great potential in promoting bilingualism and biliteracy development (ErnstSlavit & Mulhern, 2003; Jeffers, 2009). A growing number of studies have examined how bilingual children respond to texts in their developing language- English (e.g., Colledge, 2005; Gregory, 1990; McGonigal & Arizpe, 2007). However, research that builds understanding on how bilingual children respond to bilingual children's books is scarce and under-developed. In addition, there is very little empirical evidence regarding how these books can be used instructionally to promote bilingual and biliteracy development. The purpose of this study is two-fold. First of all, we investigate how Chinese children who are learning English as a foreign language respond to bilingual English/Chinese children's books. Secondly, we explore how these books can be used to develop bilingualism and biliteracy. Reader response theories (Rosenblatt, 1938) and sociocultural theories (Vygotsky, 1978) are the theoretical perspectives that underpin this study. This is the second phase of a large project on bilingual English/Chinese children's picture books. The first phase of the project focused on the examination of the quality of the bilingual picture books and has been completed. Based on the results from the first phase of the study, researchers selected four high quality bilingual picture books for the participating Chinese children to read.

Perkins and Mebert (2005) found that preschoolers who attend schools that adopt multicultural curriculum have less biased racial attitudes than those who attend schools that do not. Moreover, authentic multicultural literature is especially valuable for children from diverse cultural and linguistic background as they see their unique culture being represented in a positive light. It also helps these children to bridge the gaps between school and home (Edwards & Walker, 1995), as a result, empowering them to cope with multiple, oftentimes conflicting, identities. …"

The few studies that documented similar effects on sensorimotor performance have used only relatively coarse measures to quantify performance. This study tested the effect of stereotype threat on a rhythmic ball bouncing task, where previous analyses of the task dynamics afforded more detailed quantification of the effect of threat on motor control. In this task, novices hit the ball with positive racket acceleration, indicative of unstable performance. With practice, they learn to stabilize error by changing their ball-racket impact from positive to negative acceleration. RESULTS showed that for novices, stereotype threat potentiated hitting the ball with positive racket acceleration, leading to poorer performance of stigmatized females. However, when the threat manipulation was delivered after having acquired some skill, reflected by negative racket acceleration, the stigmatized females performed better. These findings are consistent with the mere effort account that argues that stereotype threat potentiates the most likely response on the given task. The study also demonstrates the value of identifying the control mechanisms through which stereotype threat has its effects on outcome measures.

However, these multisymbol numbers are assembled from the same set of Arabic digits and comply with the place-value structure of the Arabic number system. Considering these shared properties, we suggest that the processing of multisymbol numbers can be described in one general model framework. Accordingly, we first developed a computational model framework realizing componential representations of multisymbol numbers and evaluated its validity by simulating standard empirical effects of number magnitude comparison. We observed that the model framework successfully accounted for most of these effects. Moreover, our simulations provided first evidence supporting the notion of a fully componential processing of multisymbol numbers for the specific case of comparing two negative numbers. Thus, our general model framework indicates that the processing of different kinds of multisymbol integer and decimal numbers shares common characteristics (e.g., componential representation). The relevance and applicability of our model goes beyond the case of basic number processing. In particular, we also successfully simulated effects from applied marketing and consumer research by accounting for the left-digit effect found in processing of prices. Finally, we provide evidence that our model framework can be integrated into the more general context of multiattribute decision making. In sum, this indicates that our model framework captures a general scheme of separate processing of different attributes weighted by their saliency for the task at hand. (PsycINFO Database Record"

The present study was a 15-week intensive longitudinal design that tested whether engaging in trait-typical behaviors predicted trait change. Participants provided self-report ratings of their personality traits and were able to freely accept and complete weekly “challenges”—prewritten behavioral goals that would pull their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in line with their desired traits. Results indicated that merely accepting behavioral challenges did not predict trait changes. Rather, only actually completing challenges (i.e., performing trait-typical behaviors) predicted trait change over time. Thus, merely wanting to change does not appear to be sufficient to evoke trait growth; successfully changing one’s personality traits may require actively and successfully implementing behaviors to change oneself.

B. Zajonc's (1965) classic view about social facilitation-inhibition (SFI) effects, it was found that the presence of relatively unpredictable audiences and forced social comparison with a slightly superior coactor both facilitated performance in the Stroop task while inhibiting automatic verbal processing. Not only do these findings reveal that social presence can help inhibit the emission of dominant responses, providing further support for an attentional view of SFI effects, but they also demonstrate the power of social situations over what has been thought to be invariant automatic processing. As such, they are inconsistent with the view reiterated in more than 500 articles on Stroop interference over the past 60 years and suggest that more attention should be paid to the situations in which cognition takes place. The situations in which human beings perceive, manipulate, and interpret information have traditionally been neglected by cognitive psychologists and cognitive scientists in general. According to Levine, Resnick, and Higgins (1993), the recognition of the importance of domain-specific knowledge led cognitive psychologists to take a first step toward a possible inclusion of social factors as part of cognition. This first step, however, did not specifically involve social factors but ""did highlight how particular, how situated or contextualized, cognition always is"" (Levine et al., 1993, p. 586). As Levine et al. noted, it is in fact necessary to attend not only to knowledge elements but also to the conditions of their use, that is, the situations in which cognition takes place. In this article our purpose is to show that even relatively simple social situations can have dramatic effects on some basic cognitive responses that have been well established in psychology.

First, we replicated prior work by demonstrating that the utility value intervention, which manipulated whether students made connections between the course material and their lives, increased both interest and performance of low-performing students in a college general education course. Second, we extended prior research by both measuring and manipulating one possible pathway of intervention effects: the frequency with which students make connections between the material and their lives. In Study 1, we measured connection frequency and found that making more connections was positively related to expecting to do well in the course, valuing the course material, and continuing interest. In Study 2, we manipulated connection frequency by developing an enhanced utility value intervention designed to increase the frequency with which students made connections. The results indicated that students randomly assigned to either utility value intervention, compared with the control condition, subsequently became more confident that they could learn the material, which led to increased course performance. The utility value interventions were particularly effective for the lowest-performing students. Compared with those in the control condition who showed a steady decline in performance across the semester, low-performing male students randomly assigned to the utility value conditions increased their performance across the semester. The difference between the utility value and control conditions for low-performing male students was strongest on the final exam (d = .76)."

Here, we report a longitudinal study of children at familial risk of dyslexia, children with preschool language difficulties, and typically developing control children. Preschool measures of oral language predicted phoneme awareness and grapheme-phoneme knowledge just before school entry, which in turn predicted word-level literacy skills shortly after school entry. Reading comprehension at 8½ years was predicted by word-level literacy skills at 5½ years and by language skills at 3½ years. These patterns of predictive relationships were similar in both typically developing children and those at risk of literacy difficulties. Our findings underline the importance of oral language skills for the development of both word-level literacy and reading comprehension."

There were significant and longitudinally stable individual differences for all four reading-related skills that were independent from each of the reading and spelling skills. Yet the only significant longitudinal prediction of reading skills was from IQ at mean age 10 for reading comprehension at mean age 16. The extremely high longitudinal latent-trait stability correlations for individual differences in word recognition (.98) and spelling (.95) left little independent outcome variance that could be predicted by the reading-related skills.

LISA represents predicates and objects as distributed patterns of activation over units representing semantic primitives. These representations are dynamically bound into propositional structures, thereby achieving the structure-sensitivity of a symbolic system and the flexibility of a connectionist system. LISA also has a number of inherent limitations, including capacity limits and sensitivity to the manner in which a problem is represented. A key theoretical claim is that similar limitations also arise in human reasoning, suggesting that the architecture of LISA can provide computational explanations of properties of the human cognitive architecture. We report LISA's performance in simulating a wide range of empirical phenomena concerning human analogical access and mapping. The model treats both access and mapping as types of guided pattern classification, differing only in that mapping is augmented by a capacity to learn new correspondences. Extensions of the approach to account for analogical inference and schema induction are also discussed."

The authors present a specific instantiation of their theory in the form of a computer simulation model, Learning and Inference with Schemas and Analogies (LISA).

The argument presented herein is that the weaker Whorfian hypothesis can be quantified and thus evaluated. Models of cognition developed after Whorf 's day indicate ways in which thought can be influenced by cultural variations in the lexical, syntactical, semantic, and pragmatic aspects of language.

Whereas the testing time recommendations make sense for pediatric samples, it is unclear whether they are appropriate for young adults, who typically show significant phase delay in their diurnal rhythms. The current study explores the impact of time of day on TOVA performance in young adults with ADHD. Participants were randomly assigned to either morning or afternoon administration. We found no significant diurnal variation in TOVA performance. We also found no interaction between diurnal preference and time of day of administration. Night owls endorsed more inattention symptoms on a self-report measure than more intermediate individuals but actually made significantly fewer omission (inattention) errors on the TOVA. Self-reported symptoms of inattention showed moderate, significant correlations with various TOVA performance indices. Self-reported symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity, however, showed no relationship to TOVA performance. These results suggest that the TOVA can be administered to adults with ADHD outside of the hours recommended in the manual without significantly compromising the interpretative validity of test score interpretation. Thus, a TOVA report that is consistent with ADHD should not be dismissed simply because it was administered in the late afternoon."

Whereas the testing time recommendations make sense for pediatric samples, it is unclear whether they are appropriate for young adults in college, who typically show significant phase delay in their diurnal rhythms.

The current study examined the impact of time of day, self-reported diurnal preference, and caffeine consumption on TOVA performance in a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment with healthy college students. There was evidence of diurnal variation on average response time and impulsivity but not on overall ADHD score, with participants tested in the afternoon responding faster but making more commission errors than did participants tested in the morning.

The crucial difference between effective and struggling readers is their executive functions (EFs), and improved functions impact positively on learning to read and reading to learn. Objectives: Firstly, to show that high-risk and struggling students' persisting language and reading difficulties are accompanied by executive dysfunctions. Secondly, to present one student's daily struggles at school in a narrative based on teacher, parent and child interviews. Method: This retrospective study is based on speech-language pathology (SLP) evaluations of a clinical sample of 23 girls and boys aged 6-16 from a range of middle class families. While language and reading evaluations were tailored to the students' particular situation, i.e. age, grade, languages or complaint, EFs were examined in all with the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function teacher questionnaire. Results: Virtually all students exhibited executive dysfunctions, and many showed a high risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that inclusion of EFs in SLP evaluations is valuable in uncovering executive dysfunction comorbidity that may underlie persisting reading disorders. It is proposed that speech-language pathologists explicitly and routinely braid language and reading with EFs in their evaluations so to effectively predict, uncover and prevent persisting reading disabilities in students."

Different groups of subjects trained on 1 of 3 minimally different versions of an n-back task: n-back-with-lures (High-Conflict), n-back-without-lures (Low-Conflict), or 3-back-without-lures (3-Back). Subjects completed a battery of recognition memory and language processing tasks that comprised both high- and low-conflict conditions before and after training. We compared the transfer profiles of (a) the High- versus Low-Conflict groups to test how conflict resolution training contributes to transfer effects, and (b) the 3-Back versus Low-Conflict groups to test for differences not involving cognitive control. High-Conflict training-but not Low-Conflict training-produced discernable benefits on several untrained transfer tasks, but only under selective conditions requiring cognitive control. This suggests that the conflict-focused intervention influenced functioning on ostensibly different outcome measures across memory and language domains. 3-Back training resulted in occasional improvements on the outcome measures, but these were not selective for conditions involving conflict resolution. We conclude that domain-general cognitive control mechanisms are plastic, at least temporarily, and may play a causal role in linguistic and nonlinguistic performance. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Experiments 1 and 2 varied the amount of auditory content to be remembered. BE was not observed, but when auditory targets contained more content, boundary restriction (BR) occurred. Experiment 3 presented auditory stimuli with less content and BR also occurred. In Experiment 4, white noise was added to stimuli with less content to equalize the durations of auditory stimuli, and BR still occurred. Experiments 5 and 6 presented trained stories and popular music, and BR still occurred. This latter finding ruled out the hypothesis that the lack of BE in Experiments 1–4 reflected a lack of familiarity with the stimuli. Overall, memory for auditory content exhibited BR rather than BE, and this pattern was stronger if auditory stimuli contained more content.

Our study examined whether perceived control was predictive of individual differences in subsequent 4-year changes in episodic memory, and explored the mediating role of physical activity and indicators of physical fitness, cardiovascular, and metabolic health for control–memory associations. To do so, we used longitudinal data from the nationwide Health and Retirement Study (HRS; N 4,177; ages 30 to 97 years; 59% women). Our results show that perceiving more control over one’s life predicted less memory declines, and this protective effect was similar in midlife and old age. We additionally observed that higher levels and maintenance of physical activity over 2 years, better pulmonary function, lower systolic blood pressure (SPB), lower hemoglobin A1c, and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL–C) also predicted less memory declines. Mediation analyses revealed that levels of, and 2-year changes in, physical activity, as well as levels of pulmonary function and hemoglobin A1c and HDL–C, each uniquely mediated control–memory change associations. Our findings illustrate that perceived control, physical activity, and indicators of physical fitness and cardiovascular and metabolic health moderate changes in memory, and add to the literature on antecedents of cognitive aging by conjointly targeting perceived control and some of its mediating factors.

One hundred sixty-nine Japanese children were assessed at the beginning of grade 1 on reading accuracy and fluency, spelling, phonological awareness, phonological memory, rapid automatized naming (RAN), orthographic knowledge, and morphological awareness, and on reading and spelling at the middle of grade 1. The results showed remarkable differences in the cognitive predictors of early reading accuracy and spelling development in Hiragana and Kanji, and somewhat lesser differences in the predictors of fluency development. Phonological awareness was a unique predictor of Hiragana reading accuracy and spelling, but its impact was relatively weak and transient. This finding is in line with those reported in consistent orthographies with contained symbol sets such as Finnish and Greek. In contrast, RAN and morphological awareness were more important predictors of Kanji than of Hiragana, and the patterns of relationships for Kanji were similar to those found in inconsistent orthographies with extensive symbol sets such as Chinese. The findings suggested that Japanese children learning two contrastive orthographic systems develop partially separate cognitive bases rather than a single basis for literacy acquisition."

Results from a latent variable model showed that parent teaching predicted letter knowledge and phonological awareness, and shared book reading predicted vocabulary and rapid naming speed after controlling for family socioeconomic status. Moreover, both parent teaching and shared book reading contributed indirectly to reading accuracy and fluency in Grade 1, which then mediated the effects of home literacy environment on reading comprehension in Grades 2 and 3.

In Study 2 we investigated whether coping with a threatening math test could lead women to indulge themselves with unhealthy food later on and examined the moderation of this effect by personal characteristics that contribute to identity-threat appraisals. In Study 3 we investigated whether vividly remembering an experience of social identity threat results in risky decision making. Finally, in Study 4 we asked whether coping with threat could directly influence attentional control and whether the effect was implemented by inefficient performance monitoring, as assessed by electroencephalography. Our results indicate that stereotype threat can spill over and impact self-control in a diverse array of nonstereotyped domains. These results reveal the potency of stereotype threat and that its negative consequences might extend further than was previously thought."

To examine these developmental processes, researchers frequently use a multivariate latent growth model (LGM) in which univariate LGMs are specified for each individual construct and then correlations are examined between the slopes and intercepts of different pairs of constructs. However, if the developmental associations among the constructs are hypothesized to derive from a higher-order common ""cause"" or factor, then a more appropriate model is the factor of curves (FOCUS) model. In this paper, we describe the FOCUS model for assessing the covariation among multiple developmental measures over time.

Results support that a higher-order family academic orientation construct can be used to characterize the developmental associations among parental school perception, parental educational involvement, and children's academic competence over time. We emphasize the importance of selecting a statistical model that matches one's theory of developmental change. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Many different language skills can be affected in SLI, but not all individuals with SLI have the same set of difficulties. As a result, SLI is a highly heterogeneous condition. The ability to read and understand written text is a higher function of language, which has its base on the language skills that may be affected by SLI. Previous studies suggest that children with SLI are at risk of developing literacy difficulties at school age. To test this hypothesis a longitudinal follow-up study of SLI was performed in an urban city in Finland. Forty-three children diagnosed with SLI completed tests for lexical and rapid automatized naming (RAN) and reading ability (technical reading and reading comprehension).

However, previous work has relied exclusively on static images, portraying a single peak frame of the emotional display. Dynamic expressions, on the other hand, convey a far broader representation of the emotional reaction, but are they diagnostic of the situational valence? Participants (N = 245) watched videos portraying reactions to real-life highly positive situations and evaluated the affective valence of the target. Video information was controlled by: (a) truncating the movies after 5, 10, or 20 seconds from the start, and by (b) digitally manipulating the videos such that only the face was visible with no context, only the context was visible with no face, or the face appeared in context. Results indicate that during real-life intense positive situations, facial expressions alone were rated as negative and failed to convey diagnostic information about the positive situational valence even at the most extended presentation durations. By contrast, when contextual information appeared alone or with the face, participants accurately rated the target as feeling positive, and this positivity increased with extended viewing duration. These findings suggests poor coupling between facial valence and felt emotions, supporting the notion that when emotions run high, the diagnostic power of facial expressions is reduced. Conversely, the findings demonstrate an inherent role for contextual information in the recognition of real-life intense faces. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)."

The current study sought to comprehensively model the relation between individual differences in EFs and the expression of racial bias in 3 commonly used laboratory measures. Participants (N 485) completed a battery of EF tasks (Session 1) and 3 racial bias tasks (Session 2), along with numerous individual difference questionnaires. The main findings were as follows: (a) measures of implicit bias were only weakly intercorrelated; (b) EF and estimates of automatic processes both predicted implicit bias and also interacted, such that the relation between automatic processes and bias expression was reduced at higher levels of EF; (c) specific facets of EF were differentially associated with overall task performance and controlled processing estimates across different bias tasks; (d) EF did not moderate associations between implicit and explicit measures of bias; and (e) external, but not internal, motivation to control prejudice depended on EF to reduce bias expression. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of global and specific EF abilities in determining expression of implicit racial bias."

Experiments 1-3 compared the initiation latencies, utterance durations, and errors for syntactically simpler picture descriptions (adjective-noun phrases, e.g., the red book) to those of more complex descriptions (relative clauses, e.g., the book that is red). In Experiment 4, the syntactically more complex descriptions were also lexically more complex (e.g., the book and the car vs. the book). Simpler and more complex descriptions were produced under verbal memory load consisting of 2 or 4 unrelated nouns, or under no load. Across experiments, load actually made production more efficient (as manifested in shorter latencies, shorter durations or both), and sped up the durations of relative clauses more than those of adjective-noun phrases. The only evidence for disproportional disruption of more complex descriptions by load was a greater increase of production errors for these descriptions than for simpler descriptions under load in Experiments 2 and 4. We thus conclude that syntactic formulation in production (for certain constructions or in certain situations) can proceed with minimal working memory involvement.

Following a surge of interest in implicit attitude measures in the 90s, researchers have tried to assess self-esteem implicitly to circumvent the influence of biases inherent in explicit measures. However, the validity of implicit self-esteem measures remains elusive. Critical tests are often inconclusive, as the validity of such measures is examined in the backdrop of imperfect behavioral measures. To overcome this serious limitation, we tested the neural validity of the most widely used implicit self-esteem measure, the implicit association test (IAT). Given the conceptualization of self-esteem as attitude toward the self, and neuroscience findings that the reward-related brain regions represent an individual’s attitude or preference for an object when viewing its image, individual differences in implicit self-esteem should be associated with neural signals in the reward-related regions during passive-viewing of self-face (the most obvious representation of the self). Using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) on functional MRI (fMRI) data, we demonstrate that the neural signals in the reward-related regions were robustly associated with implicit (but not explicit) self-esteem, thus providing unique evidence for the neural validity of the self-esteem IAT. In addition, both implicit and explicit self-esteem were related, although differently, to neural signals in regions involved in self-processing. Our finding highlights the utility of neuroscience methods in addressing fundamental psychological questions and providing unique insights into important psychological constructs.

START,START,2088956987,ways of listening to depressed women in qualitative research interview techniques and analyses,1999,dana c jack,canadian psychology,1,25,32,"AbstractQualitative research on depression requires methods of interviewing and analysis that allow the researcher to hear how social factors are structured in thought and how such factors affect depressive conflict. I discuss six ways of listening used in my qualitative research: open listening, focused awareness, attending to moral language, to inner dialogues, to meta-statements, and to the logic of the narrative. Examples illustrate how listening to processes of thought leads to content analysis that preserves the individuality of subjects, and to theory formation. Silencing the Self theory is summarized as it relates to these ways of listening.Qualitative research relies on narratives, which are meaning making acts. The story a woman tells herself and retells others about the sources of her depression creates its coherence within the context of her life. Her narrative reveals her whole world--her view of herself in relationships, her sense of power, her path through life, and her strivings to reach some sort of ideal self. The language she uses to present herself not only produces meaning, but it constrains the possibilities of consciousness and the perception of choices.Since we know that many concepts used within the field of depression research and treatment have a history of maleness (Stoppard, 1989), and represent ""a deposit of the desires and disappointments of men"" (Horney, 1967, p. 56), how are we to listen to depressed women without simply reproducing this tradition? How, for example, do we listen to recurring themes of low selfesteem, negative self-judgment, and problems in relationship without appropriating them to existing theories that simply sweep them under a rug called ""dependency"" or ""lack of action and mastery strategies?"" How can these themes, particularly the standards women use to evaluate themselves negatively, alert us to deeper issues that help us find new ways of understanding women's depression?I have used interviews and qualitative analysis in research on depression in women (Jack, 1991; Jack, 1999b), lawyers' moral reasoning about dilemmas in their work (Jack & Jack, 1989), and women's aggression, which relates to their depression (Jack, 1999a). In general terms, these studies represent attempts to find new ways of understanding the interaction between person and social environment that affects women's psychology and their depressive vulnerability. My work follows the voice-centred method of inquiry proposed by Gilligan (1982) and colleagues (Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, & Tarule, 1986; Brown & Gilligan, 1992; Gilligan, Ward, & Taylor, 1988) which considers interview narratives as dialogues generated within a relationship of interviewer and subject, and which attempts to listen to a woman's experience in her own terms, from her point of view.I have found six ways of listening within interviews that help me understand the narrator's point of view from her perspective, a perspective that is critical if we are to detail the diversity of women's experiences and social contexts. The first two ways of listening occur during the interview process itself; the remaining four occur not only during the interview, but also represent types of analyses to be undertaken systematically after interviews are transcribed. In what follows, I present these ways of listening and how they have led to insights about women's depression.WAYS OF LISTENINGSince qualitative methods acknowledge the researcher as a vital part of a relational, collaborative process of inquiry (Stacey, 1991) that includes issues of inequality, ethics, and politics (Patai, 1991), we must take a reflexive stance in order to notice how we help shape the very texts we study (Fine, 1992; Shostak, 1998). First, we can attend to our own experience during interviews, to what Catherine Riessman (1993) calls the ""prelinguistic"" impact of the stories. Noticing how the swirl of story enters and affects our embodied, felt experience creates a broad, imaginative background to which we bring words that necessarily narrow as they communicate. …"

There was no evidence that the resilient readers relied on superior verbal ability or working memory to compensate for poor recoding. The resilient readers were poor at spelling, reading isolated words, and reading text rapidly, but they showed adequate phonemic awareness."

Children were first tested in kindergarten, and their reading achievement was tested yearly in both English and French from Grades 1 to 3, with word-level and passage-level measures that assessed accuracy as well as fluency. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine which English variables predicted Grade 3 outcomes and growth rates in English and French, and to determine the set of predictors that accounted for the most variance in outcomes and growth rates in English and French reading. The variables that predicted English reading development were consistent with studies of monolingual English children, even though participants were concurrently learning to read in French. Our findings provide evidence that at least some of the skills that play a role in learning to read are general cognitive and linguistic skills that transfer across languages. Phonological awareness, letter-sound knowledge, rapid automatized naming, and grammatical ability in English were able to predict reading ability in French. In contrast, English receptive vocabulary was a language-specific predictor. These findings demonstrate that first-language measures can be useful in the early identification of children at risk for difficulty in learning to read in a second language."

We propose an extension to the parallel constraint satisfaction network model (iCodes: integrated coherence-based decision and search), which assumes-in contrast to prespecified search rules-that the valence of available information influences search of concealed information. Specifically, the model predicts an attraction search effect in that information search is directed toward the more attractive alternative given the available information. In 3 studies with participants choosing between two options based on partially revealed probabilistic information, the attraction search effect was consistently observed for environments with varying costs for information search although the magnitude of the effect decreased with decreasing monetary search costs.

We examined the samenesses about learning disabilities (LD) in Guatemala and Spain, two countries with the same language but cultural, political, and educational differences, first analyzing data about the prevalence of reading and spelling disabilities in Guatemala City and the Spanish region of the Canary Islands. The focus of the second study was to determine whether there are cross-national patterns of significant differences in cognitive processes associated with reading and spelling disabilities from a developmental approach in these two cultural contexts. We found some differences in the prevalence of specific LD in reading between both countries but we did not find significant differences between Guatemalan and Spanish reading-disabled children in cognitive processes that are involved in reading and spelling acquisition in spite of the cultural and educational differences between the two countries. The assignment of people into diagnostic categories of disability has long been undertaken as part of the effort to understand human differences. Nevertheless, the classification, categorization, and labeling of children in education have been problematic because of issues such as stigmatization, peer rejection, and lowered self-evaluation (Keogh & MacMillan, 1996). The systems of classification, though, have provided a framework to guide intervention and allowed the development of specialized programs to support the special educational needs of these individuals (Minow, 1990). Evidence clearly indicates that how individual countries use classification systems differs (Florian et al., 2006). Does this result in differences in terms of the numbers of students identified with a particular disability or differences in the makeup of the difficulties underlying the disability? This article addresses these questions by considering the status and prospects of learning disabilities (LD) in Guatemala and Spain. We examine the samenesses about LD in these different cultural, political, and educational contexts. Furthermore, we provide empirical data about the prevalence of LD and the cognitive profile of Guatemalan and Spanish children with reading and spelling disabilities from a developmental approach."

Four groups were formed on the basis of their performance in phonemic awareness and rapid automatized naming (RAN): (1) one group with low performance in naming speed (NS), but average in phonological awareness (PA; naming deficit subtype); (2) a second group with low performance in PA, but normal in NS (phonological deficit subtype); (3) a third group with low performance in both variables (doubledeficit subtype); and (4) a fourth group with no deficit in PA and NS (control group). The four groups were compared on measures of lexical access (naming word and pseudowords), fluency, orthographic abilities, and reading comprehension. The double-deficit subtype showed the most difficulties with reading, and the presence of deficit in RAN in naming deficit subtype affected measures of fluency but not orthographic abilities. However, fewer differences were noted between single-deficit subgroups. These results are partially consistent with the predictions of the DDH."

Each of these articles provides valuable information for school psychologists and other professionals working in the schools, and also contributes to the literature and scholarship that aims to promote the educational success of all students. Previous articles published in The California School Psychologist, including the recent volumes addressing a) school engagement, b) strength-based assessment, c) response to intervention (RTI), d) autism, and e) students with emotional or behavioral disorders, are available on-line at www.education.ucsb.edu/school-psychology and at www.casponline.org (CASP members only). The first article (Christo & Davis, 2008), shares the results of a study that examined the relationships between the cognitive processes of rapid naming, phonological processing and various literacy skills, using data from 65 students in grades two through five. This study used multiple measures, including; phonological processing, rapid naming, reading comprehension, isolated and nonsense word reading, and spelling. Regression analyses revealed that rapid naming was a stronger predictor of word reading, reading comprehension and spelling, relative to phonological processing. Decoding skills were found to account for the largest amount of variance in word reading and spelling. The authors discuss the importance of considering these results when assessing and designing interventions with reading disabled children. Based on the results of this study, the authors emphasize that psychologists should assess underlying processes of rapid naming and phonological processing to better understand the student’s skills, and inform intervention strategies. A guide for school psychologists to use in the consultation process when working with teachers to address students’ reading difficulties is provided in the second article (Lilles, Griffiths, Lee, Cardenas, Chacko, & Jimerson, 2008). This article details important facets of instructional consultation and important considerations to take into account including: a) entering the consultation relationship, b) effectively identifying the problem and underlying cause, c) identification of the appropriate intervention, monitoring implementation integrity, and d) the termination of the consultation relationship. This article also provides information regarding possible effective intervention strategies, resources to obtain additional information, and a valuable checklist for school psychologists. The authors encourage school psychologists to use a consultation process to contribute resources and support to teachers to improve student reading ability, and prevent negative outcomes associated with poor reading skills.

The success of intentional forgetting depends on how one originally encoded the to-be-forgotten information, the scope of the forget instruction, and the type of retrieval task done later. Memory-based processes of segregation and retrieval inhibition can lead to successful forgetting when subjects may forget all of the prior information. However, they are insufficient when subjects must forget only part of it. In this case, one «forgets» (i.e., limits expression of forget-cued information) by altering one's decision processes later. Successful intentional forgetting occurs only when one intentionally retrieves information from a particular learning episode, not when the task does not expressly require this (e.g. implicit memory tasks)"

Mixed reality means that physical tangible and digital components were present. The content for the EMRELE required that students map abstract concepts and relations onto their gestures and movements so that the concepts would become grounded in embodied action. The studies compare an immersive, highly interactive learning platform that uses a motion-capture system to track students’ gestures and locomotion as they kinesthetically learn with a quality classroom experience (teacher and content were held constant). Two science studies are presented: chemistry titration and disease transmission. In the counterbalanced design 1 group received the EMRELE intervention, while the other group received regular instruction; after 3 days and a midtest, the interventions switched. Each study lasted for 6 days total, with 3 test points: pretest, midtest, and posttest. Analyses revealed that placement in the embodied EMRELE condition consistently led to greater learning gains (effect sizes ranged from 0.53 to 1.93), compared to regular instruction (effect sizes ranged from 0.09 to 0.37). Order of intervention did not affect the final outcomes at posttest. These results are discussed in relation to a new taxonomy of embodiment in educational settings.

The theory is based on 3 main principles. First, individuals try to construct a single mental model of a possibility that satisfies a current set of propositions, and if the task is impossible, they infer that the set is inconsistent. Second, when an inconsistency arises from an incontrovertible fact, they retract any singularly dubious proposition or any proposition that is inconsistent with the fact; otherwise, they retract whichever proposition mismatches the fact. A mismatch can arise from a proposition that has only mental models that conflict with the fact or fail to represent it. Third, individuals use their causal knowledge-in the form of models of possibilities-to create explanations of what led to the inconsistency. A computer program implements the theory, and experimental results support each of its principles."

Hierarchical regression and commonality analyses indicated that the decoding and listening com- prehension products accounted for considerable variance in reading comprehension. Naming speed had a small but significant effect after accounting for the Grapheme- Phoneme-conversion product (2-3%), but little effect after accounting for the word- recognition product (0-2%). Subgroup analyses indicated that naming speed had its primary effect for less able readers. Commonality analyses supported the interpretation that naming speed contributes after the Grapheme-Phoneme-conversion product but not after the word recognition product because naming speed has already had its effect upon word recognition.

Reading groups were therefore compared on the very early stages of associative learning. We used a working memory framework—including experimental designs used to investigate cross-modal binding. Two change-detection experiments showed a group discrepancy in binding that was dependent on spatial location encoding: Whereas group performance was similar when location was an inconsistent cue (Experiment 1), nondyslexic readers showed higher accuracy in binding than dyslexics when location was a consistent cue (Experiment 2). A cued-recall task confirmed that location information discriminates binding ability between reading groups in a more explicit memory recall task (Experiment 3). Our results show that recall for ephemeral cross-modal bindings is supported by location information in nondyslexics, but this information cannot be used to similar effect in dyslexic readers. Our findings support previous demonstrations of cross-modal association difficulty in dyslexia and show that a group discrepancy exists even in a single, initial presentation of visual-phonological pairs. Effective use of location information as a retrieval cue is one mechanism that discriminates reading groups, which may contribute to the longer term cross-modal association problems characteristic of dyslexia."

Always fascinated by timing in natural settings, she was also influenced by several scholars. Self-described as theorist first and experimentalist second, she reveals her insights into the relativity of time and ultimately a research program focusing on two aspects of time: a velocity-like property and a rhythmic property. She recounts her discovery of a theory of nested periodicities and entrainment of an organism with the environment, resolving issues arising from a variety of unexplained phenomena. After a fellowship at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study, she returned to OSU in the Cognitive area. It offered more involvement with graduate students out of which arose concepts of Joint Accent Structure and extensions of entrainment theory. Recognizing the value of multidisciplinary thinking to the understanding of music communication, she coorganized a multidisciplinary conference in 1991. The formation of the Society for Music Perception and Cognition (SMPC) was also announced at this meeting. She was elected as its President in 2007. Her early hypothesis of a dominant internal tempo that shifts monotonically with age was empirically confirmed recently. She intersperses narrative sections with thoughtful assessments and lessons learned, and provides concluding comments on the past, present, and future of music psychology. CHILDHOOD YEARS I grew up in Glendale, California. My parents were ordinary folk, although my mother, who was a bacteriologist and a working mom, differed from other neighborhood mothers. My mother's family lived in Santa Barbara, an historic town north of Los Angeles. My grandparents lived a block from the picturesque Santa Barbara harbor, and during my childhood, my younger brother and I spent summers and holidays at our grandparents' home. Reflecting on those years, I realize that I spent an inordinate amount of time sitting on rocks watching waves, surfing and trying to anticipate 'when' to jump the next big wave. Perhaps all this seeped into my sensibilities in some fashion. During the school year in Glendale, we lived in a big old house with a spacious music room, filled with records, a record player, and an upright piano. Next door was another old house in which two much older girls lived. One was an aspiring opera singer who entertained the neighborhood with scales and other odd vocal exercises for at least four hours a day. Her sister was an aspiring ballet dancer (who also practiced religiously, but more quietly). I mention this because I worshipped these two girls. They seemed splendid. I determined to follow in their footsteps and at age six began taking both piano and ballet lessons (it was apparent even then that I was not going to be an opera singer, although I plan to return as one in my next life). Thus, our music room became my practice room for both ballet and piano. I would like to say that I excelled in both and that I only turned to science when I failed to win the Tchaikovsky piano competition. But the truth is I did not practice my piano and gave it up in favor of ballet which I loved. I loved dance partly for the music itself (our lessons always exposed us to wonderful classical music, in those days played live by the piano accompanist). But, I also liked the soaring feeling of being lost in the music through the synchrony of gestures. It was my first exposure to the power of rhythm and timing. I had dreams of becoming a dancer. I took two-hour dance classes (modern and classical) twice a week throughout childhood, only stopping classes in my last year of high school. Alas, unlike my neighborhood idol, who indeed became a lead dancer in the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), I found that, when I reached advanced ballet classes in my teen years, I could not compete with very gifted girls in my class. …"

Study 2 replicated the findings longitudinally with resource-poor and resource-rich older individuals (N = 42). In both studies, specific SOC strategies were differentially adaptive. Results confirm that resources are important determinants of well-being but that life-management strategies have a considerable protective effect with limited resources."

In the current article, the authors propose and then test a theoretical model that integrates these factors. They specify a progressive (cascading) pattern among ability-based EI facets, in which emotion perception must causally precede emotion understanding, which in turn precedes conscious emotion regulation and job performance. The sequential elements in this progressive model are believed to selectively reflect Conscientiousness, cognitive ability, and Neuroticism, respectively. “Mixed-based” measures of EI are expected to explain variance in job performance beyond cognitive ability and personality. The cascading model of EI is empirically confirmed via meta-analytic data, although relationships between ability-based EI and job performance are shown to be inconsistent (i.e., EI positively predicts performance for high emotional labor jobs and negatively predicts performance for low emotional labor jobs). Gender and race differences in EI are also meta-analyzed. Implications for linking the EI fad in personnel selection to established psychological theory are discussed."

Three studies were conducted to fulfill these aims. In the first study, 33 children from Grade 2 were asked to name a list of 40 letters of the alphabet as quickly and as accurately as possible. A combined index of speed and accuracy was computed from these two sets of data using two formulas, which were based on the ‘z’ score and the mean variance score. A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of 0.94 was obtained between the results of the two formulas indicating that the two formulas yield almost identical results. In the second study, 37 fifth-graders were administered the word-attack sub-test of Woodcock Language Proficiency Battery. When the speed and accuracy composite index, based on the ‘z formula’ was applied to the word-attack scores, it was found that three children were slow decoders even though their scores were within the normal range. In the third study, 39 children from Grade 3 and 40 children from Grade 5 were asked to read aloud a list of words and then these words were administered as a spelling test. Subsequently, their spelling ability was assessed by computing the number of words they could both read and spell correctly. When familiarity of words was included as a factor in assessing spelling ability, five children in Grade 3 and three children in Grade 5 were found to be misclassified as poor spellers. This indicates that including word-naming speed and word familiarity (i.e. ability to pronounce) produce different metrics than when they are not. Inclusion of speed and familiarity factors in assessment can be helpful in avoiding false negatives and false positives."

Results, based on a large national sample, revealed that over a 28-year period, GMA affected growth in 2 indicators of extrinsic career success (income and occupational prestige), such that the careers of high-GMA individuals ascended more steeply over time than those of low-GMA individuals. Part of the reason high-GMA individuals had steeper growth in extrinsic success over time was because they attained more education, completed more job training, and gravitated toward more complex jobs. GMA also moderated the degree to which within-individual variation in the mediating variables affected within-individual variation in extrinsic career success over time: Education, training, and job complexity were much more likely to translate into career success for more intelligent individuals."

The experiments employed a type of compound word where the deletion of a letter results in 2 short words (e.g., backhand, back and). The boundary technique (K. Rayner, 1975) was employed to manipulate word length information in the parafovea. Accuracy of the parafoveal word length preview significantly affected landing positions and fixation durations. This disruption was larger for 2-word targets, but the results demonstrated that this interaction was not due to the morphological status of the target words. Manipulation of sentence context also demonstrated that parafoveal word length information can be used in combination with sentence context to narrow down lexical candidates. The 4 experiments converge in demonstrating that an important role of parafoveal word length information is to direct the eyes to the center of the parafoveal word."

The present longitudinal study of 172 Danish beginning readers found that speed of word recognition mainly developed after a student had reached an accuracy level of 70% correct. Hence, the number of days a child took to achieve this 70% accuracy level (the basic accuracy achievement time [BAAT]) was a measure of specific differences in accuracy development. Phoneme awareness was the strongest predictor of this measure, but RAN also contributed unique variance. Because word recognition speed may depend on the amount of time a student has been able to read with basic accuracy, the BAAT measure was used as a control in the prediction of word recognition speed (at the end of Grade 2). With this control, RAN was the only significant predictor of speed. The different predictive patterns suggest that it is important to distinguish between accuracy and speed when comparing the strength of predictors, both within and across orthographies. A practical implication is that teachers should focus on the development of basic accuracy before speed."

In contrast, size congruity had no effect when verbal numbers were the irrelevant dimension. In Experiments 2 and 3, different parameters that could possibly affect the results, such as discriminability and variability (Experiment 2) and the block design (Experiment 3), were controlled. The results replicated the effects obtained in Experiment 1. In Experiment 4, in which physical size was made more difficult to process, size congruity for irrelevant verbal numbers was observed. The present results imply that notation affects numerical processing and that Arabic and verbal numbers are represented separately, and thus it is suggested that current models of numerical processing should have separate comparison mechanisms for verbal and Arabic numbers."

Factor analysis revealed relationships between the respondents' attributions, feelings, and general attitudes. In particular, there was evidence that attitudes about gender issues were central in organizing responses on many other issues. Understanding of the murders was complex: The majority agreed with several attributional statements, including a causal role for television violence and laxity of gun control laws. The two focal attributions in this study were that the murders were a product of societal sexism and that they were random and unpredictable; support for these was negatively related and the majority agreed with both positions. Extreme support for the sexism interpretation as opposed to extreme support for the randomness interpretation was predicted by being female, not being an engineering major, and having strongly profeminist views. We discuss this in the context of attitudes towards women and gender issues, and the differing personal experiences and reactions of women and men.

START,START,1984871604,norm theory comparing reality to its alternatives,1986,"daniel kahneman, dale t miller",psychological review,1,2166,500,"A theory of norms and normality is presented and applied to some phenomena of emotional responses, social judgment, and conversations about causes. Norms are assumed to be constructed ad hoc by recruiting specific representations. Category norms are derived by recruiting exemplars. Specific objects or events generate their own norms by retrieval of similar experiences stored in memory or by construction of counterfactual alternatives. The normality of a stimulus is evaluated by comparing it to the norms that it evokes after the fact, rather than to precomputed expectations. Norm theory is applied in analyses of the enhanced emotional response to events that have abnormal causes, of the generation of predictions and inferences from observations of behavior, and of the role of norms in causal questions and answers. This article is concerned with category norms that represent knowledge of concepts and with stimulus norms that govern comparative judgments and designate experiences as surprising. In the tradition of adaptation level theory (Appley, 1971; Helson, 1964), the concept of norm is applied to events that range in complexity from single visual displays to social interactions. We first propose a model of an activation process that produces norms, then explore the role of norms in social cognition. The central idea of the present treatment is that norms are computed after the event rather than in advance. We sketch a supplement to the generally accepted idea that events in the stream of experience are interpreted and evaluated by consulting precomputed schemas and frames of reference. The view developed here is that each stimulus selectively recruits its own alternatives (Garner, 1962, 1970) and is interpreted in a rich context of remembered and constructed representations of what it could have been, might have been, or should have been. Thus, each event brings its own frame of reference into being. We also explore the idea that knowledge of categories (e.g., ""encounters with Jim"") can be derived on-line by selectively evoking stored representations of discrete episodes and exemplars. The present model assumes that a number of representations can be recruited in parallel, by either a stimulus event or an"

In real-life classrooms, achievement and further characteristics are often confounded. We disentangled achievement, ethnicity and minority status and examined whether the achievement of ethnic minority students is judged according to the predominant expectation (expectation hypothesis) and whether teachers’ judgment accuracy is influenced by students’ ethnicity or their minority status (ethnicity hypothesis or minority hypothesis). We conducted 4 experimental studies with a computer simulation (the Simulated Classroom). In Studies 1 and 2 with N = 34 and N = 30 participants, we implemented Turkish (Study 1) and Asian students (Study 2) as minorities. In contrast to the expectation hypothesis, the expectations attributed to the achievement of ethnic minority students did not bias teachers’ judgments. In both studies we found greater judgment accuracy for ethnic minority students, thereby probing the ethnicity hypothesis. In Study 3 with N = 48 participants, we further disentangled ethnicity and minority using German students as minority students, thus probing the minority hypothesis. Again, minority students were judged more accurately. Implementing gender (male vs. female) as the minority characteristic in Study 4, with N = 52 participants, yielded the same result: Minority students were judged more accurately, therefore supporting the minority hypothesis. Thus, classroom characteristics need to be considered in research on teachers’ judgment accuracy to clarify the influence of individual student characteristics and composition effects beyond individual effects.

We suggest that characteristics of the learning instantiation alone can give rise to different levels of transfer. We propose that concreteness of the learning instantiation can hinder analogical transfer of well-defined structured concepts, such as mathematical concepts. We operationalize the term concreteness as the amount of information communicated through a specific instantiation of a concept. The 5 reported experiments with undergraduate students tested the hypothesis by presenting participants with the concept of a commutative mathematical group of order 3. The experiments varied the level of concreteness of the training instantiation and measured transfer of learning to a new instantiation. The results support the hypothesis, demonstrating better transfer from more generic instantiations (i.e., ones that communicate minimal extraneous information) than from more concrete instantiations. Specifically, concreteness was found to create an obstacle to successful structural alignment across domains, whereas generic instantiations led to spontaneous structural alignment. These findings have important implications for the theory of learning and transfer and practical implications for the design of educational material. Although some concreteness may activate prior knowledge and perhaps offer a leg up in the learning process, this benefit may come at the cost of transfer."

Specifically, the study examined whether students’ vulnerability to mind wandering during the lecture would predict learning from, and situational interest in, the video and also whether longhand note-taking would help reduce mind wandering, at least for some students. One half of the participants took notes during the video, and all were subsequently tested on lecture content without notes. Regression and mediation analyses indicated that (a) several individual-differences variables (e.g., pretest score, prior math interest, classroom media multitasking habits) uniquely predicted in-lecture mind wandering frequency; (b) although the note-taking manipulation did not reduce mind wandering at the group level, note-taking still reduced mind wandering for some individuals (i.e., those with lower prior knowledge and those who took notes of high quality and quantity); (c) mind wandering uniquely predicted both learning (posttest) and situational interest outcomes above and beyond all other individual-differences variables; (d) moreover, mind wandering significantly mediated the effects of several individual differences; and, finally, (e) not all types of mind wandering were problematic—in fact, off-task reflections about lecture-related topics positively predicted learning.

Whereas prior research has examined the effects of experimentally induced mental contrasting, we address sad mood as a contextual influence promoting self-initiated mental contrasting. Across various mood inductions, sad moods--which are associated with problem solving strategies--facilitated self-initiated mental contrasting more than neutral moods (Studies 1, 5) or happy moods (Studies 2, 3, 4, 6). Importantly, mood did not affect the relation between mental contrasting and selective formation of goal commitment (Studies 5, 6).

It is therefore surprising that few studies have investigated the impact of intergroup contexts and motivations on attention to the eyes of ingroup and outgroup members. Four experiments investigated differences in eye gaze to racial and novel ingroups using eye tracker technology. Whereas Studies 1 and 3 demonstrated that White participants attended more to the eyes of White compared to Black targets, Study 2 showed a similar pattern of attention to the eyes of novel ingroup and outgroup faces. Studies 3 and 4 also provided new evidence that eye gaze is flexible and can be meaningfully influenced by current motivations. Specifically, instructions to individuate specific social categories increased attention to the eyes of target group members. Furthermore, the latter experiments demonstrated that preferential attention to the eyes of ingroup members predicted important intergroup biases such as recognition of ingroup over outgroup faces (i.e., the own-race bias; Study 3) and willingness to interact with outgroup members (Study 4). The implication of these findings for general theorizing on face perception, individuation processes, and intergroup relations are discussed."

Dorsal system learning is implicit and associates noncategorized stimuli within dimensional modules. Ventral system learning can be implicit or explicit. It also allows associating events across dimensions and therefore is the basis of cross-task integration or interference. depending on degree of cross-task correlation of signals. Accordingly, lack of correlation rather than limited capacity is responsible for dual-task effects on learning.

Relative to baseline performance in the standard-naming task, participants were induced to respond with faster latencies, shorter durations, and lower levels of accuracy by instructing them to time response initiation with an experimentally controlled tempo. The tempo response cue attenuated stimulus effects, and as faster tempos reduced latencies, the number of spelling-sound errors remained constant, whereas the number of word, nonword, and articulatory errors increased. To explain these results, the authors propose input gain as a mechanism of control over processing speed. The experimenters sketch how input gain could account for the current results as well as for the results from stimulus-blocking experiments testing the route emphasis and time criterion hypotheses of strategic control."

Contrary to predictions, Afrocentricity was associated with less perceived partner dependability and satisfaction for the couples.

The teachers were taught to analyze students’ responses to instruction using a strategic protocol, which included a series of verbally governed questions. The study was designed to determine whether the instructional method would affect the number of verbally governed decisions which the teachers made as well as the number of academic objectives achieved by the teachers’ students. A multiple baseline design across three teachers and six students was used to measure the effectiveness of the instructional procedures. The results indicated that the teachers’ students achieved significantly more learning objectives when they used a verbally governed algorithm to solve instructional problems. Applications to teaching of research findings from the basic and applied sciences of behavior require teachers that can function as strategic scientists. In other words, teachers need to analyze the learning problems of individual children and know when and how to apply relevant and tested tactics from the literature. This is the hallmark of differentiated instruction or therapy by evidence-based applied behavior analysis. The identification of effective tactics requires the location of the possible source of the problem as well as the selection of a tactic that is most likely to remediate the problem. Both of these steps require the teacher to complete a contingency analysis of the components of instruction (Greer, 2002; Greer, 2004; Greer, Keohane & Healy 2003; Greer & Keohane 2004;). The pursuit of solutions to particular learning problems involves many of the repertoires that Skinner (1957) characterized as the verbal behavior of scientists.

Whereas some studies have reported an increase in TL priming over development, others have reported a decrease. These findings have led to the development of 2 somewhat contradictory accounts of letter position development: the lexical tuning hypothesis and the multiple-route model. One factor that may be contributing to these discrepancies is the use of baseline primes that substitute letters in the target word, which may confound the effect of changes in letter position processing over development with those of letter identity. The present study included an identity prime (e.g., listen-LISTEN), in addition to the standard two-substituted-letter (2SL; e.g., lidfen-LISTEN) and all-letter-different (ALD; e.g., rodfup-LISTEN) baselines, to remove the potential confound between letter position and letter identity information in determining the effect of the TL prime. Priming effects were measured in a lexical decision task administered to children aged 7-12 and a group of university students. Using inverse transformed response times, targets preceded by a TL prime were responded to significantly faster than those preceded by 2SL and ALD primes, and priming remained stable across development. In contrast, targets preceded by a TL prime were responded to significantly slower than those preceded by an ID prime, and this reaction-time cost increased significantly over development, with adults showing the largest cost. These findings are consistent with a lexical tuning account of letter position development, and are inconsistent with the multiple-route model. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Participants displayed a wide range of reading ability and attention control. Multiple regression was used to determine how well the phonological processing components, verbal working memory, and attention control predict reading performance. All equations were highly significant. Phonological memory predicted word identification and decoding. In addition, phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming predicted every aspect of reading assessed, supporting the notion that phonological processing is a core contributor to reading ability. Nonetheless, phonological processing was not the only predictor of reading performance. Verbal working memory predicted fluency, decoding and comprehension, and attention control predicted fluency. Based upon our results, when using Baddeley’s model of working memory it appears that the phonological loop contributes to basic reading ability, whereas the central executive contributes to fluency and comprehension, along with decoding. Attention control was of interest as some children with ADHD have poor reading ability even if it is not sufficiently impaired to warrant diagnosis. Our finding that attention control predicts reading fluency is consistent with prior research which showed sustained attention plays a role in fluency.

Method: 105 children from second to fifth grades of elementary school were gathered into six groups: Dyslexia group (D; n=19), Language-based learning disability group (LBLD; n=16); their respective control groups paired according to different variables - age, gender, grade and school system (public or private) (D-control and LBLD-control); and other control groups paired according to different reading accuracy (D-accuracy; LBLD-accuracy). All of the children read an expository text and orally retold the story as they understood it. The analysis quantified propositions (main ideas and details) and retold links. A retelling reference standard (3-0) was also established from the best to the worst performance. We compared both clinical groups (D and LBLD) with their respective control groups by means of Mann-Whitney tests. Results: D showed the same total of propositions, links and reference standards as D-control, but performed better than D-accuracy in macro structural (total of links) and super structural (retelling reference standard) measures. Results suggest that dyslexic children are able to use their linguistic competence and their own background knowledge to minimize the effects of their decoding deficit, especially at the highest text processing levels. LBLD performed worse than LBLD-control in all of the retelling measures and LBLD showed worse performance than LBLD-accuracy in the total retold links and retelling reference standard. Those results suggest that both decoding and linguistic difficulties affect reading comprehension. Moreover, the linguistic deficits presented by LBLD students do not allow these pupils to perform as competently in terms of text comprehension as the children with dyslexia do. Thus, failure in the macro and super-structural information processing of the expository text were evidenced. Conclusion: Each clinical group showed a different retelling profile. Such findings support the view that there are differences between these two clinical populations in the non-phonological dimensions of language."

Although behavioral weight-loss interventions effectively produce modest weight losses in the short term, defined as 5–10% of initial weight in six months (Wadden, Crerand, & Brock, 2005), long-term maintenance remains elusive. Overweight and obese individuals typically give up the lifestyle and self-regulatory changes they have made during a weight-loss program—such as healthy eating, physical activity, and vigilant record keeping—and regain 30–50% of the weight loss within one year after the program ends (Barte et al., 2010; Jeffery et al., 2000). Maintenance interventions based on a ‘continued care’ perspective rely on active intervention and staff contact over time to sustain skills learned during weight loss, such as record-keeping and problem-solving skills (Perri & Corsica, 2002; Svetkey et al., 2008; Wadden et al., 2005). Although often highly successful at improving weight-loss maintenance when intervention and staff contact are in place, these maintenance interventions may only delay rather than prevent weight regain (Perri & Corsica, 2002; Wadden et al., 2005). Discouragingly, individuals leaving interventions with active maintenance components typically regain weight at the same rate as individuals leaving weight-loss programs without such maintenance components, sometimes regaining weight even before maintenance contact ends (Perri & Corsica, 2002; Perri et al., 2001; Wadden et al., 2005).

Whereas these results could be interpreted as providing even stronger support for a continued care perspective, there may be additional skills that must be mastered for long-term weight maintenance. These skills may be independent from those needed for losing weight (King et al., 2002; Rothman, 2000; Sciamanna et al., 2011), but are not currently being incorporated into interventions. We hypothesized that individuals who want to successfully maintain a weight loss may need to proactively focus on weight “stability,” that is how to keep themselves at a stable and steady weight (Kiernan et al., 2005; Kiernan, Goldberg, & Durkin, 2003; Kiernan, Goldberg, Kirkpatrick, & Raymond, 2000). Consequently, they may need to learn a set of “stability skills” that optimizes satisfaction with the immediate day-to-day experience of engaging in lifestyle and self-regulatory habits. These skills include learning how to eat a healthy diet in appropriate portion sizes and be more physically active without feeling deprived or dissatisfied (relative deprivation theory; Kruglanski & Mayseless, 1990) and learning how to regulate or “fine-tune” the balance between their eating, activity, and weight with the minimum effort and attention necessary (limited resources theory; Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, & Tice, 1998). In addition, individuals may be more successful if they learn these stability skills before initiating weight loss, thus, capitalizing on initial motivation, providing a mastery experience for weight stability, and increasing perceived self-efficacy for maintaining a stable weight in the future (social cognitive theory; Bandura, 1986).

This randomized trial examined whether learning a novel set of stability skills before losing weight improved long-term weight management, i.e., during a 12-month follow-up period after intervention sessions and staff contact had ended. Overweight/obese women were randomly assigned to one of two 6-month interventions that differed in the content and order of the maintenance modules. In Maintenance First, women participated first in an 8-week weight stability skills maintenance module, then in a standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss program. In Weight Loss First, women participated first in a standard 20-week behavioral weight-loss program, then in an 8-week problem-solving skills maintenance module. Thus, Maintenance First (a multi-component approach) differed in two important ways from Weight Loss First (a standard care approach). The Maintenance First condition consisted of both novel content (learning a set of stability skills designed to optimize day-to-day satisfaction with lifestyle and self-regulatory habits) and a novel order (placing a maintenance module before a weight loss program). In this trial, we hypothesized that women randomized to Maintenance First would regain less weight over the 12-month follow-up than women randomized to Weight Loss First."

START,START,2134602297,hypnosis and cognition,2014,john f kihlstrom,NA,0,7,117,"This article summarizes the contributions of hypnosis to our understanding of cognition. These contributions have been especially salient in the study of memory, and include source amnesia and the distinction between episodic and semantic memory; the occurrence of semantic priming in implicit (unconscious) memory; and paramnesia (false memory). Posthypnotic amnesia shows that explicit and implicit memory can be dissociated even under optimal encoding conditions. The hypnotic alterations of perception may expand the scope of central executive control over “low-level” sensory and perceptual processes, and offer a new perspective on perceptual couplings. Implicit (unconscious) perception in hypnosis is not subject to the same analytic limitations encountered in masked priming. In the study of “high-level” thought processes, hypnosis has played an important role in understanding the formation of delusional beliefs, and of intuitions in problem-solving. Studies of hypnosis suggest that automatic processes can be “de-automatized,” as in the reversal of Stroop interference by suggestions for hypnotic agnosia. In social cognition, Orne’s analysis of demand characteristics laid the foundations for the cognitive revolution in social psychology, by underscoring the status of subjects—and people outside the laboratory—as active, sentient, problem-solving agents. The search for correlates of hypnotizability led to the incorporation of openness to experience as a major cognitive dimension in the structure of personality.

Twenty-seven low-achieving readers and 34 typically achieving readers participated in this study. The low-achieving readers performed significantly more slowly than their typically achieving reading peers on the four measures of rapid naming. The response rates for both alphanumeric naming tasks (digits and letters) showed strong negative correlations with oral reading fluency, while their response rates for the non-alphanumeric naming tasks (Color and Object naming) showed relatively weak relationships with reading measures for both groups. In regression equations, Letter naming tasks were uniquely associated with both word recognition and oral reading fluency. The utility of using alphanumeric naming tasks as indicators for identifying Korean Hangul readers who are at risk for reading disabilities is discussed."

We show that both images are correct, but that the routes to creativity are culturally patterned, such that Catholic creatives are relatively more likely to take the emotionally intense route and Protestant creatives relatively more likely to take the sublimating route. This pattern is consistent for both the Big-C creativity of historical eminents (Studies 1 and 1b) and small-c creativity of student samples (Studies 2 and 3). The student samples also highlighted the moderating role of Protestant asceticism, as Protestants who were high in asceticism and who also repressed or minimized troublesome emotions were particularly creative.

How do practicing clinical psychologists use the context of life events to judge the abnormality of a person’s current behaviors? The appropriate role of life-event context in assessment has long been the subject of intense debate and scrutiny among clinical theorists, yet relatively little is known about clinicians’ own judgments in practice. The authors propose a proportionate-response hypothesis, such that judgments of abnormality are influenced by whether the behaviors are a disproportionate response to past events, rendering them difficult to understand or explain. Licensed, practicing clinical psychologists (N 77) were presented with vignettes describing hypothetical people’s behaviors (disordered, mildly distressed, or unaffected) that had been preceded by either traumatic or mildly distressing events. Experts’ judgments of abnormality were strongly and systematically influenced by the degree of mismatch between the past event and current behaviors in strength and valence, such that the greater the mismatch, the more abnormal the person seemed. A separate, additional group of clinical psychologists (N 20) further confirmed that the greater the degree of mismatch, the greater the perceived difficulty in understanding the patient. These findings held true across clinicians of different theoretical orientations and in disorders for which these patterns of judgments ran contrary to formal recommendations in the DSM–IV–TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).

In the article a black line should have been included with an arrow from “Prosodic sensitivity” to “Reading comprehension” in Figure 2b.] Emerging evidence suggests that children’s sensitivity to suprasegmental phonology such as stress and timing (i.e., prosodic sensitivity) contributes to reading. The primary goal of this study was to investigate pathways of the relation of prosodic sensitivity to reading (word reading and reading comprehension) using data from 370 first-grade children. Specifically, we examined (a) the nature of the relations of prosodic sensitivity to word reading by systematically testing five alternative models (i.e., direct relations and indirect relations via phonological awareness or morphological awareness) after accounting for letter naming fluency and rapid automatized naming and (b) the relation of prosodic sensitivity to reading comprehension (a direct relation over and above word reading and listening comprehension, or an indirect relation via word reading and listening comprehension). A prosodic sensitivity task tapping into stress and timing (i.e., word stress task) was used. Structural equation model results showed that prosodic sensitivity was not directly related to word reading. Instead, its relation was completely mediated by phonological awareness and morphological awareness. Furthermore, once word reading, listening comprehension, and working memory were accounted for, prosodic sensitivity was not related to reading comprehension. Therefore, it appears that prosodic sensitivity makes a contribution to word reading primarily via phonological awareness and morphological awareness, and its influence on reading comprehension is via word reading and listening comprehension. These results suggest that explicit attention to prosodic sensitivity might be beneficial for developing phonological awareness and morphological awareness, which, in turn, improve reading skills.

START,START,1991013767,recollections of an accidental contrarian,2006,doreen kimura,canadian journal of experimental psychology,1,0,8,"First, I sincerely thank BBCS for this honour. It seems especially appropriate to receive this award in Montreal, where I started my studies many years ago at McGiIl University. As so often in life, I got to McGiIl somewhat by chance. I was finishing off my high school senior year with the Saskatchewan government correspondence school while teaching in a one-room schoolhouse in northern Manitoba. I noticed an ad in the Manitoba Teacher's magazine urging teachers to encourage qualified students to apply for an entrance scholarship to McGiIl. I applied, and to my delight was successful. So I ended up in 1953 living in Royal Victoria College at the corner of University and Sherbrooke, at that time the McGiIl women's residence. For a girl from a farming village in Saskatchewan this was quite a change. My teacherage in Manitoba had no telephone, no electricity, no running water, no central heating (in fact not much heating at all), and no indoor toilets (Figure 1). In two months I went from that to a stately and comfortable mansion in the heart of a big city. The after-dinner coffee was served to us in gracious lounges by freshmen residents. It was quite another world (Figure 2). In my first year at McGiIl, I took Introductory Psychology taught by Dr. Hebb. Although he insisted that we not take notes, and in fact encouraged us to bring our knitting, his lectures were such a fascinating series of informed speculations about how the brain might work in mediating behaviour that it influenced all my subsequent research. There was an oral examination at the end of the Honours Psychology program. Hebb's question to me was, what contribution had Tinkelpaugh made to psychology? I had never heard of Tinkelpaugh. For any of you in the same boat, Tinkelpaugh did a study on monkeys in the 1920s that Hebb was particularly fond of and you can read about it in both the Organization of Behavior (1949) and in Hebb's introductory textbook (1958). I felt my ignorance had not made a great impression on Hebb, and when in my last year I went to talk to him about going into graduate school, somewhat at the last minute, he said ""Why would a nice girl like you want to go into graduate school?"" This seemed a strange question to me - and probably elicited a gasp from some in today's audience. But I believe, aside from an element of real concern, that it had another purpose, which was to determine how serious I was. He pointed out that I had been a teacher and that this was a satisfying occupation, whereas research could be very frustrating. But I persisted, and managed to convince him that within the limits of my experience, I had enjoyed research more than anything else I had done. He ultimately became extremely helpful, and was instrumental in getting me accepted at Berkeley. I was offered a research assistantship at Berkeley, which at that time meant that the first two years would be spent doing prescribed research entirely for someone else (admittedly a world-renowned researcher) while I studied for comprehensive exams. This really did not appeal to me, and I went back to Hebb with the letter. He had always argued that graduate students should get started on research of their own very early; he agreed that the Berkeley offer was unpalatable, and I was then and there admitted to graduate studies at McGUl. In the first year of graduate school, all students at that time took part in what was called only ""Hebb's seminar."" In our first assignment, we did a group presentation and in my group I was designated the organizer. The topic was ""The circumnavigation of cognition,"" the paper by that name spoofing the overarching learning theory of the time, which explained much of what is called ""cognition"" as a series of unidirectional S-R connections. Apparently I had redeemed myself from the Tinkelpaugh episode. Graduate School Hebb's approach to graduate student education emphasized doing research right from the start. …"

Results Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were employed to investigate a number of possible theory-based models of phonological processing and reading in the kindergarten and Grade 1 data separately. In kindergarten, the most successful model showed naming and memory abilities contributing toward the acquisition of letter knowledge and the development of rhyming ability, which in turn supported synthesis, which then contributed to analysis which had the only significant effect upon reading. In the Grade 1 data, the most successful model followed the same general' structure, with fewer significant paths for naming, memory, and rhyming abilities. The kindergarten data were then used to predict Grade 1 reading ability, in both structural equation modelling and regression analysis. These results indicated that phonological analysis was the most salient predictor of Grade 1 reading, and that the causal path was more plausibly from analysis to reading than from reading to analysis.

Interest in reading in Grade 1 was weakly correlated with Grade 3 reading ability, but correlations were lower for interest measured in Grades 2 and 3. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated weak and inconsistent effects of reading interest on reading ability after controlling general cognitive ability, SES, phonological awareness and naming speed.

The authors describe the theoretical connexions amongst these indicators and word reading. The authors conclude that there is substantial evidence of each contributing to reading, and in most cases, this contribution is above and beyond that of the other predictor constructs. These findings have implications for early and regular cognitive assessment, and for curriculum development and teacher education. Keywords: reading development, phonological awareness, naming speed, orthographic processing, morphological awareness Our goal in this paper is to review evidence concerning six major factors that have been shown to be related to reading development. We chose to focus on cognitive factors, not because motivation and self-perception are unimportant, but rather because the cognitive factors are more plausible causes of reading development. We also confined our discussion to specific cognitive factors that are involved in the process of reading, rather than on more general cognitive factors, such as intelligence, that are related to a broader range of behaviours, and whose specific causal role is more difficult to establish. Similarly, we omitted the various demographic characteristics that have been related to reading, such as gender and socioeconomic status (SES), partly because it is difficult to establish their causal status or exercise an influence on them, but also because, like the socioemotional factors, they operate on reading through the cognitive mechanisms that support reading. Finally, we focus on word reading, and not on reading comprehension. We do this partly because of the evidence that reading comprehension depends upon word reading (e.g., Adams, 1990), and partly because the cognitive factors on which we focus have a more proximal relationship to the more basic aspects of reading. We seek to understand the longitudinal predictors of reading for two reasons. First, because reading is a critical academic skill and because it takes so long to acquire, we would like to be able to predict reading difficulties before they occur and act to prevent them as best we can. Second, because the cognitive processes involved in learning to read are diverse and causally tangled, we explore the development of reading and its underlying processes so that we can untangle these causal relations. The first justification should lead to better educational practise, the second to better theory and practise. Reading instruction, broadly speaking, includes the intended curriculum, classroom teaching methods, assessment practises, remedial practises, and so on. These practises tend to develop in an ad hoc manner, with relatively little input from theory. Curriculum planners and classroom teachers are often not in a good position to judge theories and the evidence upon which they are based. Therefore, we see it as the responsibility of researchers in psychology and educational psychology to provide the empirical research foundation on which best practises in curriculum, teaching, assessment, and diagnosis are designed. A comprehensive theory based on solid evidence would provide a better basis for the development of principled practise and could make a substantial contribution to teacher education. The remainder of this paper consists of three sections. In the first, we briefly review several theories and sketch an overall theoretical framework that involves six causal factors. In the second, we examine each of the six factors in greater detail, and the evidence for their effects on reading. In this section, we pay particular attention to how the causal factors are related to each other, and whether they have unique effects in the presence of each other. …"

Measures were selected to address five phonological processing constructs (naming speed, memory, rhyming, phonological synthesis, and phonological analysis), letter knowledge, and the ability to pronounce words by analyzing them into smaller parts (decoding). Measures of these constructs and several measures of reading achievement were administered to an initial sample of 161 kindergarten children and then readministered to as many of the same children as possible in grades 1 and 2; in grade 3 the reading achievement tests were administered. Principal components analyses were used to derive factor scores for the phonological constructs in kindergarten and grades 1 and 2. In grade 2 five factors were found, but in kindergarten and grade 1 the phonological synthesis and analysis measures formed one phonological awareness factor. The factor scores, letter knowledge, decoding, and the reading achievement scores for each grade were used as predictors of reading achievement in subsequent grades in a series of hierarchical regression analyses. Results supported the proposed theory, with phonological awareness (or analysis), naming speed, and letter recognition being the most frequent significant predictors and R2s ranging from .69 to .89. The constructs identified in the theory are argued to be important targets for both assessment and instruction. The value of theoretical models of achievement is discussed."

NA Research suggests that, under some conditions, redundant multisensory cues supports better learning, when compared with unisensory cues. NA This was examined systematically across two experiments. NA In Experiment 1, children aged 5-, 7- and 10- years were allocated to one of the three ‘modality’ conditions (audio informative only, visual informative only, and audiovisual informative) and explicitly instructed to learn the category membership of individual exemplars, as determined by a threshold of correct responses. Unisensory or redundant multisensory cues determined category membership, depending on the learning condition. In addition to significant main effects of age group and condition, a significant interaction between age and sensory condition was found, with five-year-olds performing better when presented with redundant multisensory cues compared to unisensory cues. 10-year-olds performed better with auditory informative only cues, compared to visual informative only cues, or informative but redundant multisensory cues, with no significant difference between the latter two. In Experiment 2, the multisensory condition was presented to separate groups of 5-, 7-, and 10-year-olds, examining explicit learning outcomes in the audiovisual informative condition. NA Results showed that children who reached threshold during training were faster, made fewer errors, and performed better during test trials. Learning appeared to be based on the visual informative cues. Findings are discussed in the context of age-related selective attention, suggesting that the value of providing multisensory informative cues to support real-world learning depends on age and instructional context."

The authors hypothesized that type of binding is critical for the occurrence of such deficits. Relational binding abilities (associating separate visual units) should degrade with age, whereas more automatic conjunctive binding abilities (associating features within an object) should not. They contrasted associative memory and item memory using a change-detection task with colors and shapes in younger (18-33 years) and older (64-82 years) healthy adults. Color was either a surface feature of the shape (conjunctive binding) or a feature of a shape-external frame (relational binding). In a direct test of associative memory, participants memorized color-shape associations; in an indirect item memory test, participants were required to memorize only the shapes, and the authors measured the costs of ignoring task-irrelevant color changes from study to test. In the direct test, associative memory was poorer when relational binding was required rather than conjunctive binding, and associative memory was poorer in the older group, but no age-related association deficit was apparent. In the indirect test, by contrast, type of binding interacted with age: younger participants showed study-test congruence effects independent of the type of binding, but older adults showed enhanced congruence effects for conjunctive stimuli, indicating intact or even enhanced conjunctive binding, and practically no costs for relational stimuli, indicating poor relational binding. This stimulus-specific effect of a task-irrelevant feature change indicates that relational and conjunctive binding in working memory are differently affected by healthy aging.

Paradoxically, Japanese children have serious difficulty analysing phonological processes when they have dyslexia. Neurobiological deficits in Japanese dyslexia remain unclear and need to be identified, and may lead to better understanding of the commonality and diversity in the disorder among different linguistic systems. The present study investigated brain activity that underlies deficits in phonological awareness in Japanese dyslexic children using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We developed and conducted a phonological manipulation task to extract phonological processing skills and to minimize the influence of auditory working memory on healthy adults, typically developing children, and dyslexic children. Current experiments revealed that several brain regions participated in manipulating the phonological information including left inferior and middle frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, and bilateral basal ganglia. Moreover, dyslexic children showed altered activity in two brain regions. They showed hyperactivity in the basal ganglia compared with the two other groups, which reflects inefficient phonological processing. Hypoactivity in the left superior temporal gyrus was also found, suggesting difficulty in composing and processing phonological information. The altered brain activity shares similarity with those of dyslexic children in countries speaking alphabetical languages, but disparity also occurs between these two populations. These are initial findings concerning the neurobiological impairments in dyslexic Japanese children."

Clinicians have traditionally worked together with ministers to help them understand the special vulnerabilities faced by members of the clergy.

Previous accounts of PI differed in whether they attributed PI to impaired retrieval or impaired encoding. Here, we suggest an integrated encoding-retrieval account, which assigns a role for each of the two types of processes in buildup of PI. Employing a typical PI task, we examined (i) the role of encoding processes in PI by recording scalp EEG during study of nontarget and target lists, and (ii) the role of retrieval processes in PI by measuring recall totals and response latencies in target list recall. In addition, we measured subjects' working memory capacity (WMC). Behaviorally, the PI effect arose in both recall totals and response latencies, indicating PI at the sampling and the recovery stage of recall. Neurally, we found an increase in electrophysiological activities in the theta frequency band (5-8 Hz) from nontarget to target list encoding, indicating an increase in memory load during target list encoding. The results demonstrate that impaired retrieval and impaired encoding can contribute to PI. They also show that WMC affects PI. For both encoding and retrieval processes, PI was reduced in high-WMC subjects, suggesting that these subjects are able to separate target from nontarget information and create stronger focus on the target material."

The available empirical evidence for this general valence asymmetry in similarity suffers from a lack of direct tests, low representativeness, and possible confounding variables (e.g., differential valence intensity, frequency, familiarity, or concreteness of positive and negative stimuli). To address these problems, Study 1 first validated the spatial arrangement method (SpAM) as a similarity measure. Using SpAM, Studies 2-6 found the proposed valence asymmetry in large, representative samples of self- and other-generated words (Studies 2a/2b), for words of consensual and idiosyncratic valence (Study 3), for words from 1 and many independent information sources (Study 4), for real-life experiences (Study 5), and for large data sets of verbal (i.e., ∼14,000 words reported by Warriner, Kuperman, & Brysbaert, 2013) and visual information (i.e., ∼1,000 pictures reported in the IAPS; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 2005; Study 6).

Across 2 pilot studies and 9 main studies (N = 3,264) with different methodologies and various self-control domains, we found consistent evidence that individuals experience higher satisfaction with restraint the more they rely on reason than on feelings. The proposed effect uniquely concerns individual differences in lay rationalism and is independent from individual differences in trait self-control. We also show that authenticity (feeling true to oneself) is the mechanism underlying this effect and rule out self-typicality (acting in ways typical of oneself) as an alternative account. Additionally, we examined downstream consequences of this effect for compensatory authenticity seeking. These findings advance a more nuanced view of self-control based on identity and suggest that the subjective utility of restraint is contingent upon individual differences in reliance on reason versus feelings in decision making. Our research contributes to the understudied topic of the phenomenology of self-control and provides novel insights into its potential downsides for some individuals.

The data supporting this idea pertain almost entirely to demands for physical effort. However, the same minimization principle has often been assumed also to apply to cognitive demand. The authors set out to evaluate the validity of this assumption. In 6 behavioral experiments, participants chose freely between courses of action associated with different levels of demand for controlled information processing. Together, the results of these experiments revealed a bias in favor of the less demanding course of action. The bias was obtained across a range of choice settings and demand manipulations and was not wholly attributable to strategic avoidance of errors, minimization of time on task, or maximization of the rate of goal achievement. It is remarkable that the effect also did not depend on awareness of the demand manipulation. Consistent with a motivational account, avoidance of demand displayed sensitivity to task incentives and covaried with individual differences in the efficacy of executive control. The findings reported, together with convergent neuroscientific evidence, lend support to the idea that anticipated cognitive demand plays a significant role in behavioral decision making."

The results demonstrated that counting and RAN were powerful predictors of arithmetic and reading fluency. Controlling for phonological awareness, vocabulary, memory, and mother's education had little impact on the predictive relation of counting and RAN to fluency in arithmetic and reading. The number concept skill did not remove the predictive relation of counting with reading or arithmetic and had only a predictive relation to arithmetic fluency after controlling for cognitive skills. Findings suggest that the strong predictive relation counting had with reading and arithmetic fluency does not exist with all number skills. This finding supports the view that there is something specific in the verbal counting skill related to the development of fluency, which should be studied in the future."

We propose a 2-stage framework to explain the benefits of retrieval. Stage 1 takes place as one attempts to retrieve an answer, which activates knowledge related to the retrieval cue. Stage 2 begins when the answer becomes available, at which point appropriate connections are strengthened and inappropriate connections may be weakened. This framework raises a basic question: Does it matter whether Stage 2 is initiated via successful retrieval or via an external presentation of the answer? To test this question, we asked participants to attempt retrieval and then randomly assigned items (which were equivalent otherwise) to be retrieved successfully or to be copied (i.e., not retrieved). Experiments 1, 2, 4, and 5 tested assumptions necessary for interpreting Experiments 3a, 3b, and 6.

START,START,2135979820,the concept of activity in soviet psychology vygotsky his disciples and critics,1986,alex kozulin,american psychologist,1,166,28,"The concept of activity is deeply ingrained in Soviet psychological theory, and exactly for that reason contemporary Soviet psychologists have found it extremely difficult to define it clearly. This concept was first suggested by Lev Vygotsky as a theoretical remedy for psychological systems that tautologically ""explained"" phenomena of consciousness through the concept of consciousness. Vy- gotsky' s disciples, notably Alexei Leontiev, departed from the original concept of their teacher. The demarcation line separating Vygotsky's theory from that of Leontiev oc- curred in the evaluation of the relative importance of se- miotic mediation and practical actions for the development of intelligence. Currently there is a revival of interest in the problem of activity both in the Soviet Union and in the United States. The concept of activity plays as important and ambiguous a role in Soviet psychology as did the concept of behavior in American studies circa 1920 to 1950 and the concept of consciousness in European psychology of the late 19th century. Activity has been the chief category of psycho- logical research in contemporary Soviet psychology since the beginning; and exactly for that reason, the concept of activity has been extremely difficult for Soviet psy- chologists to define clearly. Since the time of its inception in the 1920s, this category has undergone a metamor- phosis and has been the subject of so many disputes that it cannot be adequately comprehended out of the context of its history. The goal of this article is to provide a historical- theoretical analysis of the evolution of the concept of ac- tivity in Soviet psychology. The origin of this concept can be found in the early writings of Lev Vygotsky (1896- 1934), who suggested that socially meaningful activity (Tdtigkeit) may serve as an explanatory principle in re- gard to, and be considered as a generator of, human con- sciousness. Further, I review the process of incorporating the concept of activity into Vygotsky's cultural-historical theory of higher mental functions and discuss its relevance for Vygotsky's studies in the development of language and concept formation. The most dramatic event in the history of the concept of activity occurred in the mid- 1930s when a group of Vygotsky's disciples came up with a ""revisionist"" version of activity theory that put practical (material) actions at the forefront while simultaneously playing down the role of signs as mediators of human activity. This revisionist position was elaborated theoret- ically by Alexei Leontiev, who subsequently gained the status of official interpreter of Vygotsky's ideas. Thus the myth of succession between Vygotsky's and Leontiev's schools of psychology was born. Only in the late 1970s has this myth been subjected to a critical scrutiny, and Vygotsky's genuine views have attracted a renewed in- terest. For a long period of time, the concept of activity has remained a local affair of Soviet psychology. In his clas- sical book The New Man in Soviet Psychology, Raymond Bauer (1952) neglected entirely the concept of activity. More recent studies, such as those of Ted Payne (1968), Levy Rahmani (1973), and Luciano Mecacci (1979), mentioned this problem but hardly made it a center of their work. The major breakthrough occurred when a volume of translations, The Concept of Activity in Soviet Psychology, edited by James Wertsch, appeared in 1981. Since then, there has been a growing interest among American psychologists in the problem of activity. To comprehend this problem properly, one should, however, be cognizant of its complex history and the current re- evaluation of it by the younger generation of Soviet psy- chologists.

Eleven dyslexic children underwent an eight week training focused on mental imagery, articulation and tracing of letters, groups of letters and words, which resulted in significant gains in reading skills. This was followed by an eight week null period (control) where no intervention was administered and no further significant gains in reading were observed. Structural scans were obtained before the intervention, after the intervention and after the null period. GMV increases between the first two time points were found in the left anterior fusiform gyrus/hippocampus, left precuneus, right hippocampus and right anterior cerebellum. However these areas did not change between time points two and three (control period), suggesting that the changes were specific to the intervention period.

The present study examined the effectiveness of three remedies (judicial instructions, deliberation, and continuance) in combatting the negative impact of different types of pretrial publicity. Two different types of pretrial publicity were examined: (a) factual publicity (which contained incriminating information about the defendant) and (b) emotional publicity (which contained no explicitly incriminating information, but did contain information likely to arouse negative emotions). Neither instructions nor deliberation reduced the impact of either form of publicity; in fact, deliberation strengthened publicity biases. Both social decision scheme analysis and a content analysis of deliberation suggested that prejudicial publicity increases the persuasiveness and/or lessens the persuasibility of advocates of conviction relative to advocates of acquittal. Acontinuance of several days between exposure to the publicity and viewing the trial served as an effective remedy for the factual publicity, but not for the emotional publicity. The article concludes by discussing the potential roles of affect and memory in juror judgment and evaluating the available remedies for pretrial publicity."

Some theories of mind wandering suggest that it is caused by decreased attentional control associated with lower working memory (WM) capacity. Others suggest that it is caused by attention being directed toward internally generated thoughts and that it is associated with higher WM capacity. These ideas were assessed testing older adults because they have been argued to have reduced attentional control and lower WM capacity. The first account predicts that mind wandering should increase in older adults, while the second account predicts the opposite. Two experiments show that older adults exhibited a lower rate of mind wandering than younger adults. However, when using text interest as a covariate, the age difference in mind wandering disappeared.

To maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of same-sex social relationships, we propose that women’s mate guarding is functionally flexible and that women are sensitive to both interpersonal and contextual cues indicating whether other women might be likely and effective mate poachers. Here, we assess one such cue: other women’s fertility. Because ovulating (i.e., high-fertility) women are both more attractive to men and also more attracted to (desirable) men, ovulating women may be perceived to pose heightened threats to other women’s romantic relationships. Across 4 experiments, partnered women were exposed to photographs of other women taken during either their ovulatory or nonovulatory menstrual-cycle phases, and consistently reported intentions to socially avoid ovulating (but not nonovulating) women—but only when their own partners were highly desirable. Exposure to ovulating women also increased women’s sexual desires for their (highly desirable) partners. These findings suggest that women can be sensitive to subtle cues of other women’s fertility and respond (e.g., via social exclusion, enhanced sexual attention to own mate) in ways that may facilitate their mate retention goals while not thwarting their affiliative goals.

The current study investigates attentional biases toward emotions in two closely related species, humans and chimpanzees. Prior research has demonstrated that humans typically show an attentional bias toward emotions. We here build on that literature by studying the underlying unconscious mechanisms within and across humans and chimpanzees and aim to gain insight into the evolutionary continuity of expressions. Experiment 1 tested whether chimpanzees show an attentional bias toward the expressions of conspecifics and whether this putative bias is modulated by the stimulus presentation duration, being 33 ms or 300 ms. The stimuli were followed by a visual mask in the form of a neutral body image. This backward-masking procedure eliminated the visibility of the stimuli that were presented for 33 ms, rendering their presentation subliminal. In contrast to our prediction, no attentional bias toward emotions was observed in chimpanzees. The goal of Experiment 2 was to verify this finding and to investigate chimpanzees' reaction to human stimuli. Replicating Experiment 1, no evidence of an attentional bias toward emotions was observed in chimpanzees. In Experiment 3 we used the same chimpanzee and human expressions in 711 museum visitors and confirmed that humans do have an attentional bias toward emotions. Interestingly, this bias was independent of the stimulus presentation duration and most strikingly, independent of the species that was observed. Implications for theorizing about species differences in attentional mechanisms in processing emotions are discussed, as well as directions for future research, to investigate our preliminary findings and this potential species difference further.

Previous research on the effects of grade retention on student development has, however, generated ambiguous results, particularly in terms of motivational outcomes. This ambiguity has been attributed in part to a lack of high-quality studies including a longitudinal design, a suitable comparison group, and adequate statistical control of preretention differences. Based on longitudinal data of N = 3,288 German students over 3 years of secondary school, we examined differences in their academic self-concept, scholarly interests, learning motivation, and achievement motivation between those being retained in the 6th grade (n = 61) and those of the same age being promoted annually. To account for confounding variables, we applied full propensity score matching on baseline measures of the dependent variables, as well as various other covariates that have been found to be associated with the risk of retention (e.g., cognitive ability, academic performance, and family background variables). Results reveal a steep decline in students’ academic self-concept, interests, and learning motivation during the last months spent in the original class, just before retention. For those measures that were available, negative effects were still partly significant after 1 year, but had diminished 2 years after grade retention. Contrary to predictions suggested by the big-fish-little-pond effect, we found no positive effects of retention on students’ academic self-concept.

Seven studies reported here demonstrate that this occurred partly because most past studies gave subjects hase-rate information before giving them individuating information. A recency effect in the use of base-rate and individuating information is demonstrated using a set of reasoning problems of varying character. The recency effect is shown to be the result of subjects' inferences (based on conversational conventions) that the experimenter believes that subjects should rely most on the piece of information presented last. Additional evidence discredits the hypothesis that the recency effect is due to heightened availability of more recently acquired information in memory. One of the most engaging topics of research in social cognition has been the impact of base-rate information on social judgments. Numerous empirical studies have compared the impact of base-rate information with the impact of individuating information about a person on assessments of the person's category membership or likely future behavior. Although early research suggested that individuating information overwhelms base-rate information (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; Nisbett & Borgida, 1975), later studies revealed that base-rate information can have substantial impact when the base rate is derived from a representative sample (Wells & Harvey, 1977), when the individuating information lacks credibility (Schwarz, Strack, Hilton, & Naderer, in press), when the base rate has strong causal implications (Ajzen, 1977), when people bring a scientific orientation to a problem (Zukier & Pepitone, 1984), or when inferential rules suggesting the use of base rates have been activated (Ginossar & Trope, 1987).

Ninety-four children, aged 72 to 91 months at the outset, were examined across five testing occasions spanning the first two-and-a-half years of formal schooling.

The experimental words were written in hiragana (syllabaries) or kanji (morphograms), two types of scripts in the Japanese writing system. The words consisted of six clusters: (a) real words transcribed in hiragana, involving no special syllables and involving special syllables; (b) pseudowords in hiragana; (c) real words transcribed in kanji, in the language textbook for Grade 2 and for Grade 4; and, (d) pseudowords in kanji. Single-word vocalization latencies were significantly shorter for skilled comprehenders than for less skilled comprehenders in both hiragana and kanji, for all clusters. These results were replicated when pseudowords were excluded (Experiment 2) and when real words and pseudowords were presented in separate subsessions (Experiment 3). The results were consistent with findings for English and suggested that naming speed is a good indicator of the automaticity of the lexical access for both syllabaries and morphograms. Contrary to the previous findings for English, however, the skilled/less skilled differences in vocalization latencies were greater for real words than for pseudowords for both hiragana and kanji. The skilled/less skilled differences in vocalization latencies were greater for real kanji words than for real hiragana words. The applicability of the verbal efficiency theory proposed by Perfetti (1985) across languages and orthographies is discussed.



SE REALIZARON tres experimentos para examinar si las latencias de vocalizacion para palabras japonesas diferian entre buenos lectores y lectores con dificultades de quinto grado. Las palabras experimentales estaban escritas en hiragana (silabarios) o kanji (morfogramas), dos tipos de escritura del sistema de escritura del japones. Los itemes consistian en seis palabras con grupos consonanticos: (a) palabras reales transciptas en hiragana con y sin silabas especiales, (b) pseudopalabras en hiragana, (c) palabras reales transcriptas en kanji, en los libros de lectura de 2° y de 4° grado y (d) pseudopalabras en kanji. Las latencias de vocalizacion fueron significativamente mas breves en el caso de los buenos lectores que en el de los lectores con dificultades, tanto en hiragana como en kanji, para todos los grupos consonanticos. Estos resultados fueron replicados cuando se excluyeron las pseudopalabras (Experimento 2) y cuando las palabras reales y las pseudopalabras se presentaron en sesiones diferentes (Experimento 3). Los resultados fueron consistentes con los obtenidos para el ingles y sugieren que la velocidad para nombrar palabras es un buen indicador de la automaticidad del acceso lexico tanto para los silabarios como para los morfogramas. Contrariamente a lo reportado para el ingles, sin embargo, las diferencias en latencias de vocalizacion entre buenos lectores y lectores con dificultades fue mayor para palabras reales que para pseudopalabras, tanto en hiragana como en kanji. Las diferencias en latencias de vocalizacion entre buenos lectores y lectores con dificultades fue mayor para palabras reales en kanji que para palabras reales en hiragana. Se discute la adecuacion para diferentes lenguas y ortografias de la teoria de la eficiencia verbal propuesta por Perfetti (1985).



DREI EXPERIMENTE wurden durchgefuhrt, um zu uberprufen, ob begabte und weniger begabte japanische Pflichtschuler der 5. Schulstufe Vokalisationslatenzen bei japanischen Wortern aufweisen. Die experimentellen Begriffe wurden in Hiragana (Silbenschrift) oder Kanji (Bilderschrift) geschrieben, den zwei Formen der japanischen Schreibweise. Der Wortschatz bestand aus 6 Gruppen: (a) reale Worter, transkribiert in Hiragana, sowohl ohne als auch mit besonderen Silbenzeichen; (b) Pseudoausdrucke in Hiragana; (c) reale Worter transkribiert in Kanji aus dem Sprachubungsbuch fur die Stufe 2 und 4; weiters (d) Pseudoworter in Kanji. Die Erfassung der Lautung von einzelnen Wortern war deutlich rascher bei geubten Lesern als bei weniger begabten, sowohl in Hiragani als auch in Kanji, was bei allen Wortgruppen zu beobachten war. Diese Ergebnisse wurden bestatigt, als Pseudoworter ausgelassen wurden (Experiment 2) und als wirkliche Worter und Pseudoworter in eigenen, untergeordneten Lehreinheiten prasentiert wurden (Experiment 3). Die Resultate ergaben sich aus der richtigen Benennung im Englischen und legten nahe, das die Geschwindigkeit in der Erfassung und Benennung der Begriffe ein guter Indikator fur den automatisierten lexikalischen Zugang ist, was sowohl fur Silben als auch fur Morpheme gilt. Im Gegensatz zur vorangegangenen Treffsicherheit in der richtigen Benennung des japanischen Begriffes im Englischen konnte ein eindeutiger Unterschied der Begabten/Unbegabten bei der Vokalisation von realen Kanji-Wortern gegenuber ebensolchen in Hiragana festgestellt werden. Die Anwendung der verbalen Effizienz-These, vorgestellt von Perfetti (1985), und die Querverbindung von Sprache und Orthographie wird ebenso diskutiert."

Spontaneous clustering did not differ between age groups or between an individual-words (presentation of individual study words in consecution) and a whole-list (presentation of the whole study list at once for the same total duration) presentation format in 132 younger (18–30 years, M ? 19.7) and 120 older (60–84 years, M ? 69.5) adults. However, after instructions to use semantic clustering (second list) age-related differences in recall magnified, indicating a utilization deficiency, and both age groups achieved higher recall in the whole-list than in the individual-words format. While this whole-list benefit was comparable across age groups, it is notable that older adults were only able to improve their average recall performance after clustering instructions in the whole-list but not in the individual-words format. In both formats, instructed clustering was correlated with processing resources (processing speed and, especially, working memory capacity), particularly in older adults. Spontaneous clustering, however, was not related to processing resources but to metacognitive beliefs about the efficacy and difficulty of semantic clustering, neither of which indicated awareness of the benefits of the whole-list presentation format in either age group. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that presentation format has a nontrivial influence on the utilization of semantic clustering in adults. The analyses further highlight important differences between output-based and list-based clustering measures."

Integrating perspectives from social identity theory and acculturation research with a coalitional psychology framework, we show that an underlying mechanism for such bias is the perception that dual identifiers are disloyal to the majority group. In Study 1, majority-group participants in the U.S. questioned the loyalty of a dually identified Arab immigrant more than one who identified solely with the (American) majority group, especially under intergroup threat, which in turn predicted less favorable feelings toward the immigrant. Study 2 conceptually replicated the effect of the identity manipulation and the mediating influence of perceived loyalty on judgments about an immigrant being allowed to enlist in the U.S. military. Study 3, partially replicated the findings in Poland, focusing on Russian immigrants as targets. In Study 4, which independently manipulated both the identity expressed by immigrants and their loyalty, a dually identified immigrant whose loyalty to the majority group was portrayed as high was not judged as less qualified than an immigrant who identified only with the majority group for jobs with the potential to inflict damage on the majority group. Study 5, replicated and extended the previous studies in the context of fans of allied or rival soccer teams in Germany, revealing the moderating role of existing group relations on the hypothesized loyalty processes. In summary, coalitionally driven perceptions of (dis)loyalty appear to undergird bias toward minority-group members who hold dual identifications.

Two structural equation models were compared: Model 1, in which students’ test scores were explained by grade point average (GPA) together with mastery and detrimental motivational attitudes, and Model 2, in which TOT was added to the model to mediate the effects of GPA and the 2 motivational constructs. Fitting the models to nationally representative data of 4,249 Finnish 9th graders (Mage = 15.92 years) confirmed the hypothesis that investment of time plays a key role in explaining test scores in low-stakes assessment even when prior ability (GPA) is taken into account. It was also confirmed that the effects of the detrimental attitudes on students’ attainment were mediated by TOT. The study makes an important contribution to research regarding the role of motivational attitudes and TOT in low-stakes assessment, which is vital for the use of the assessment results in national and international benchmarking. It is concluded that log data provide a functional way to investigate time investment in CBA as an indicator for students’ effort, yielding relevant implications for educational psychologists."

Drawing on common experiential features of leisure, psychological need theories, and bottom-up models of SWB, we suggest that leisure engagement influences SWB via leisure satisfaction. We examine the proposed cross-sectional relations and mediation model using random-effects meta-analyses that include all available populations. To provide a stronger test of causal influence, we also examine longitudinal relations between leisure satisfaction and SWB and effects of experimental leisure interventions on SWB using random effects meta-analyses of all available populations. Findings based on 37 effect sizes and 11,834 individuals reveal that leisure engagement and SWB are moderately associated (inverse-variance weighted r = .26) and mediated by leisure satisfaction. Cross-lagged regression analyses of longitudinal studies, controlling for prior SWB, reveal bottom-up effects of leisure satisfaction on SWB (β = .15) and top-down effects of SWB on leisure satisfaction (β = .16). Experimental studies reveal that leisure interventions enhance SWB (d = 1.02). Compared with working samples, retired samples exhibit a stronger relation between leisure engagement and SWB, and between leisure satisfaction and SWB. Measures of the frequency and diversity of leisure engagement are more strongly associated with SWB than measures of time spent in leisure. Overall, although not minimizing top-down influences, results are consistent with bottom-up models of SWB and suggest that the leisure domain is a potentially important target for enhancing SWB"

During select years of the study we also administered tests of counting and math facts skills. We examined whether girls or boys were overrepresented among the bottom or top performers on any of these tasks, relative to their peers, and whether growth rates or predictors of math-related skills differed for boys and girls. Our findings support the notion that sex differences in math are minimal or nonexistent on standardized psychometric tests routinely given in assessments of primary school age children. There was no persistent finding suggesting a male or female advantage in math performance overall, during any single year of the study, or in any one area of math or spatial skills.

This theory was later rejected on the basis of numerous findings that people identify irrelevant (and supposedly unattended) stimuli. A careful review of this evidence, however, reveals strong reasons to doubt that these irrelevant stimuli were in fact unattended. This review exposed a clear need for new experiments with tight control over the locus of attention. The authors present 5 such experiments using a priming paradigm. When steps were taken to ensure that irrelevant stimuli were not attended, these stimuli produced no priming effects. Hence, the authors found no evidence that unattended stimuli can be identified.

These perceptions consist of a person’s knowledge and beliefs about a particular group, and they typically contain an affective component. Children use these perceptions or social categories to help interpret social situations and guide their behavior in social situations (Crick & Dodge, 1994). One very important social category for children in elementary and middle school is one based on popularity or peer status. During these years of development, children become increasingly concerned with their own peer status and, as a result, increasingly susceptible to peer influence (e.g., O’Brien & Bierman, 1988). Understanding the characteristics attributed to peers who are seen as popular and socially central may inform researchers about the behavioral processes that children and adolescents use to increase their own status in the peer group. Within developmental psychology, most research on peer status has used sociometric nominations as the primary method of gathering data. Using this methodology, researchers have typically asked children in the peer group to name those peers that they like and those they dislike and have then classified these target peers into groups on the basis of the votes received (e.g., Coie, Dodge, & Coppotelli, 1982).

In three experiments the authors reexamined these conclusions by introducing novel measures of task knowledge and self-insight and using ""rolling regression"" methods to analyze individual learning.

Specifically, successful math achievement is necessary for the technological jobs of the 21st century and for many other daily activities (Mazzocco & Thompson, 2005). As a result of the growing emphasis on technology in today's workplace, employees are expected to display a higher skill level in mathematics than in the past (Clarke & Shinn, 2004). Furthermore, according to the National Science Board (2003), the careers with the highest rate of growth will require individuals who are proficient in math and science. Therefore, students with mathematics deficiencies may have limited career opportunities. In addition to the limited job opportunities associated with mathematics deficiency, there are also economic consequences of poor mathematics achievement. Because math-oriented jobs tend to yield higher salaries, differences in mathematics achievement levels may contribute to the growing economic disparity among various groups in the United States. As such, there has been increased concern for individuals of lower socioeconomic status, minorities, and females because these groups generally tend to exhibit lower levels of mathematics achievement (Arnold, Fisher, Doctoroff, & Dobbs, 2002; Business-Higher Education Forum, 2005; National Science Foundation, 2003). As a result, these patterns of mathematics proficiency and career opportunities may contribute to the gender gap in salaries and to intergenerational cycles of poverty (Arnold et al., 2002). Given the importance of mathematics proficiency in today's society, it is necessary to understand current mathematics achievement among students in the United States. Children's Achievement in Mathematics Recent research shows that many students in the United States are failing to acquire the mathematics skills necessary to succeed both within and outside the classroom (Clarke & Shinn, 2004; National Research Council [NRC], 2001; Reese, Miller, Mazzeo, & Dossey, 1997). Furthermore, national studies examining students' math achievement indicate that students may not possess the skills necessary to meet the changing technological demands of the workplace (Clarke & Shinn, 2004). One such assessment is the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which is an ongoing assessment of the proficiency of America's students in various skill areas (e.g., reading, mathematics, writing). NAEP provides insights regarding the academic achievement, instructional experiences, and school environment for students in Grades 4, 8, and 12. The 2007 NAEP results in mathematics showed that approximately 18% of students in Grade 4 and 29% of students in Grade 8 were below the basic level of achievement. Approximately 37% of fourth-graders and 32% of eighth-graders were at the basic level. The basic level is defined by NAEP as ""partial mastery of knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work"" (Reese et al., 1997, p. 53). In the same assessment, 39% of fourth-graders and 32% of eighth-graders were at or above the proficient level. Proficiency is defined by NAEP as students having ""demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter"" and being ""well-prepared for the next level of schooling"" (Reese et al., 1997, p. 53). Overall, results of the NAEP show that the majority of students are failing to meet the national standards set for proficiency in mathematics. The demand for mathematical skills in the workplace, coupled with current low levels of mathematics proficiency, suggest a need to examine how math skills develop and which early math skills are most important for later mathematics achievement. In addition, results of such research would inform early identification and intervention efforts to promote early mathematics development and prevent later failure. Early Development of Mathematics Skills The importance of early identification of children who are likely to experience later academic difficulties in school has been highlighted by many scholars and school-based practitioners. …"

However, research on bilingual word recognition in the auditory modality has been scarce, and it has yielded mixed results with regard to the degree of this language nonselectivity. In the present study, we investigated whether listening to a second language (L2) is influenced by knowledge of the native language (L1) and, more important, whether listening to the L1 is also influenced by knowledge of an L2. Additionally, we investigated whether the listener's selectivity of lexical access is influenced by the speaker's L1 (and thus his or her accent). With this aim, Dutch-English bilinguals completed an English (Experiment 1) and a Dutch (Experiment 3) auditory lexical decision task. As a control, the English auditory lexical decision task was also completed by English monolinguals (Experiment 2). Targets were pronounced by a native Dutch speaker with English as the L2 (Experiments 1A, 2A, and 3A) or by a native English speaker with Dutch as the L2 (Experiments 1B, 2B, and 3B). In all experiments, Dutch-English bilinguals recognized interlingual homophones (e.g., lief [sweet]-leaf /li:f/) significantly slower than matched control words, whereas the English monolinguals showed no effect. These results indicate that (a) lexical access in bilingual auditory word recognition is not language selective in L2, nor in L1, and (b) language-specific subphonological cues do not annul cross-lingual interactions."

The critical stimuli were interlingual homophones (e.g., lief [sweet] - leaf /li:f/). Participants recognized homophones significantly slower than matched control words. Importantly, neither the semantic constraint of the sentence, nor the proficiency level of the bilinguals interacted with this interlingual homophone effect. However, when we compared the slow and fast reaction times (RTs), we observed a reduction in the homophone interference effect when listening to high-constraining sentences in L1 for the slow RTs, but not for the fast RTs. Taken together, this provides strong evidence for a language-nonselective account of lexical access when listening in L1, and suggests that even when low-proficient bilinguals are listening to high-constraint sentences in L1, both languages of a bilingual are still activated."

We assessed the extent to which these handwriting measures are associated with spelling. A series of regression analyses revealed that the handwriting measures altogether significantly contributed to children’s spelling performance, with age, nonverbal reasoning, and vocabulary knowledge statistically controlled. Handwriting fluency and Vietnamese copying were unique correlates of spelling even after considering all well-established cognitive measures, including morphological awareness, orthographic awareness, and phonological awareness.

According to terror management theory, maintaining a basic meaningful view of reality is a key prerequisite for managing concerns about mortality. Therefore, mortality salience should decrease liking for apparently meaningless art, particularly among those predisposed to unambiguous knowledge. Accordingly, mortality salience diminished affection for modem art in Study 1, and this effect was shown in Study 2 to be specific to individuals with a high personal need for structure (PNS). In Studies 3 and 4, mortality salient high-PNS participants disliked modern art unless it was imbued with meaning, either by means of a title or a personal frame of reference induction.

Visual and Auditory Temporal Order Judgement were administered as well as three subtests of a standardized attention test. The correlation between visual and auditory TOJ was only moderate, challenging the assumption of a general, cross-modal temporal processing deficit. Regression analyses revealed attention as a significant predictor of children's TOJ performance. Once attentional differences were accounted for, temporal processing made a significant but small contribution (3% of variance explained) to reading (but not spelling), but also to arithmetic achievement, indicating that the prediction is not specific to literacy skills. Phonology and Rapid Automatized Naming explained considerable variance even when introduced after TOJ, contradicting the assumption that the verbal deficits in dyslexia result from temporal processing problems. Multiple case studies of 40 children with serious deficits in temporal processing revealed no consistent group pattern. Problems in temporal processing do not necessarily lead to literacy impairment but might be a marker of minor deviances in brain development."
START,START,2137786269,deficits in phoneme segmentation are not the core problem of dyslexia evidence from german and english children,2000,"karin landerl, heinz wimmer",applied psycholinguistics,1,168,23,"A widely held assumption about dyslexia is that difficulties in accessing the constituent phonemes of the speech stream are responsible for specific reading and spelling difficulties. In consistent orthographies, however, the acquisition of accurate phonological recoding and phonemic awareness was found to pose much less difficulty than in English, and even dyslexic children were found to exhibit high levels of performance in phonemic segmentation (Wimmer, 1993). Nevertheless, using a rather complex phonological awareness and manipulation task (spoonerisms: MAN–HAT → HAN– MAT), Landerl, Wimmer, and Frith (1997) found support for the original position on phonological awareness deficit, as both German and English dyslexic children showed poor performance. In the present studies, the spoonerism responses of Landerl et al. were reanalyzed such that children were given credit for partially correct responses (e.g., a response of HAN for MAN–HAT). Such partially correct responses were taken to indicate full segmentation of both stimulus words at the onset–rime level. The effect of this rescoring was that the error rate dropped from 76% to 26% for the English dyslexic children and from 63% to 15% for the German dyslexic children. Even higher performance levels, although not perfect as for the age-matched control children, were found on a nonword spelling task in both groups. A second study examined the segmentation of consonant clusters in younger German dyslexic children and found performance levels of about 90% correct when memory problems were ruled out. We argue that, at least in the context of a consistent orthography (and a phonics-based teaching approach), deficits in phoneme awareness are only evident in the early stages of reading acquisition, whereas rapid naming and phonological memory deficits are more persistent in dyslexic children."

In a group of 115 students (65 girls, 50 boys) acquiring the phonologically transparent German orthography, prediction measures (letter knowledge, phonological short-term memory, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, and nonverbal IQ) were assessed at the beginning of Grade 1; reading fluency and spelling were tested at the end of Grade 1 as well as in Grades 4 and 8. Reading accuracy was close to ceiling in all reading assessments, such that reading fluency was not heavily influenced by differences in reading accuracy. High stability was observed for word reading fluency development. Of the dysfluent readers in Grade 1, 70% were still poor readers in Grade 8. For spelling, children who at the end of Grade 1 still had problems translating spoken words into phonologically plausible letter sequences developed problems with orthographic spelling later on. The strongest specific predictors were rapid automatized naming for reading fluency and phonological awareness for spelling. Word recognition speed was a relevant and highly stable indicator of reading skills and the only indicator that discriminated reading skill levels in consistent orthographies. Its long-term development was more strongly influenced by early naming speed than by phonological awareness."

Specifically, it examined the relation between inhibitory control and number line estimation performance. Experiment 1 compared the accuracy of adults’ (N = 53) estimates on 2 number line tasks, 1 with standard (power of 10) endpoints (0–1,000) and the other with nonstandard endpoints (364–1,364). Inhibition, as measured by Stroop task performance, predicted the accuracy of estimation on the nonstandard number line task, above and beyond estimation on the standard task. In Experiment 2, changes in kindergartners’ (N = 42) 0–100 number line estimation were elicited through randomized training conditions, which involved playing a numerical board game. Stroop task performance was related to the rate of improvement in estimation, controlling for pretest number line task performance. The results provide a potential explanation for the relation between inhibitory control and mathematics achievement: Individuals with better inhibitory control may be better able to suppress the activation of prior knowledge and may be less vulnerable to interference from such knowledge. Potential implications for instructional design are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

The authors examined whether this camera perspective bias persists in more ecologically valid contexts. In Study 1, neither a realistic videotaped trial simulation nor potentially corrective judicial instruction was sufficient to mitigate the prejudicial effect of camera perspective on mock jurors’ assessments of voluntariness or on their all-important final verdicts. Study 2 suggests that perhaps the best camera perspective to use is one that focuses trial fact finders’ attention on the interrogator, as this particular vantage point may facilitate decision makers’ capacity to detect coercive influences, which in turn could, in some cases, improve assessments of the confession’s reliability. In criminal trials, fact finders (judges and jurors) make decisions based on an evaluation of the evidence presented. The kind of evidence that possibly has the greatest impact on the decision making of these trial fact finders is a defendant’s prior admission of guilt. This view of confessions as highly incriminating is held not only by legal scholars and practitioners but also by the general public (Kassin & Neumann, 1997; McCormick, 1972; Wigmore,"
START,START,1980809464,the reciprocal effects of science on practice insights from the practice and science of goal setting,2001,gary p latham,canadian psychology,1,16,65,"Abstract The hypothesis of this paper is that the science and practice of psychology are interdependent. Science drives practice which drives science. The science and practice of 25 years of programmatic research on goal setting theory in industrial-organizational (1/0) psychology is used in support of this hypothesis. Scientists, practitioners, and scientist-practitioners alike are encouraged to work in unison in order to advance psychology for all. The Smothers brothers, two comedians, have made millions of dollars from one sentence: ""Mom always liked you best."" People laugh in empathy recalling how as the older child, only the baby sat on mom's knee, or as the younger child recalling that only the older child was granted special privileges. The Smothers brothers' description of their relationship is not unlike the description one can make of the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA) in that many practitioners feel strongly that CPA exists primarily for scientists; many scientists know that CPA exists primarily for practitioners. The hypothesis of this paper is that the science and practice of psychology are interdependent rather than a dichotomy. Scientific theories in psychology provide frameworks for practice. They facilitate the development of effective methodologies as well as provide a basis for understanding the success or failure of a predictor or an intervention (Latham & Crandall, 1991). They thus provide a basis for predicting, understanding, and influencing what people say and do. Practice provides evidence for the external validity of a scientific theory. Practice facilitates the abandonment, modification or improvement of theory through subsequent hypothesis testing in both the field and in laboratory settings. In short, practice suggests refinements to theory, and the refined theory provides an improvement in guidelines for effective practice. An illustration of this bidirectional refinement is the science and practice of goal setting theory in industrial-organizational (I/o) psychology. I/0 psychology explicitly embraces the scientist-practitioner model. GOAL SETTING THEORY The core findings of Locke and Latham's (1990) goal setting theory are that: (1) Specific high goals lead to higher performance than setting no goals or setting an abstract goal such as ""do your best""; (2) There is a linear relationship between goal difficulty and performance. Thus the higher the goal the higher the performance; (3) Variables such as feedback, participation in decision making, and competition only affect performance to the extent that they lead to the setting of and commitment to specific high goals; (4) Three of the four mediators of the goal setting performance relationship are motives tional, namely direction, effort, and persistence; the fourth is cognitive, namely, task strategies. Moderators of the effect of goals on performance are ability, commitment, feedback, task complexity, and situational constr-aints. The immediate empirical origin of this theory can be found in Locke's (1964) doctor-al dissertation as well as a series of laboratory experiments that he conducted shortly thereafter (Locke, 1968). The dependent variables in his experiments included mathematical problems, making words from anagrams, as well as creating toys. On the scientist-practitioner continuum, Locke places himself on the scientific end, although he has had a practice in clinical psychology and continues to have a consulting relationship with organizations in the public and private sector. I, on the other hand, view myself on the practitioner side of the continuum although I conduct research in both field and laboratory settings, and I hold a full-time position in an academic institution. My consulting practice is incorporated in Canada and in the United States. Locke and I have collaborated productively for 25 years. We view one another as scientistspractitioners.

Specifically, we focus on the Holocaust and the fact that massive failure of the environment to mediate needs, as in genocide, will throw into question the existence of empathy, human communication, and ultimately one's own humanity, to which any mirroring ceases to exist. Such a life experience will represent, to the survivor of trauma, failure of a responsive empathic agent or function. Because it is precisely representations of need-satisfying interactions that provide the basis for links between personal existence and social connectedness, undermining the individual's representation of the need-mediating context will deconstruct the link between self and other. Destruction of the victim's representational matrix of interpersonal relatedness results in a vulnerability and loneliness in his or her internal world representation which is the sine qua non of man-made trauma."

The aim of this paper is to provide a cross-cultural exploration of dreaming in the context of shamanism. We proceed by addressing 2 fundamental questions: What is meant by the terms shaman and shamanic principle, and what is the distinction between monophasic and polyphasic social groups with regards to the veridicality and cultural significance of dreams? It will be demonstrated that the kind of society in which shamanism arises (groups having polyphasic cultures) is quite different compared to modern materialistic/technocratic society (those having monophasic cultures). Subsequently, our cross-cultural investigation of shamanic dreaming focuses on the shamanic call, initiation and healing. Finally, we elucidate the major elements of core shamanism as they appear to influence dreaming, dream interpretation and dream culture, and suggest that in fact dreaming invites shamanism."

However, the question of the functional role of each of these systems remains seldom addressed and poorly understood. We capitalized on the formal framework of Bayesian Programming to develop COSMO (Communicating Objects using Sensory-Motor Operations), an integrative model that allows principled comparisons of purely motor or purely auditory implementations of a speech perception task and tests the gain of efficiency provided by their Bayesian fusion. 
Here, we show three main results. (i) In a set of precisely defined “perfect conditions”, auditory and motor theories of speech perception are indistinguishable. (ii) When a learning process that mimics speech development is introduced into COSMO, it departs from these perfect conditions. Then auditory recognition becomes more efficient than motor recognition in dealing with learned stimuli, while motor recognition is more efficient in adverse conditions. We interpret this result as a general “auditory-narrowband vs. motor-wideband” property. (iii) Simulations of plosive-vowel syllable recognition reveal possible cues from motor recognition for the invariant specification of the place of plosive articulation in context, that are lacking in the auditory pathway. This provides COSMO with a second property, where auditory cues would be more efficient for vowel decoding and motor cues for plosive articulation decoding. These simulations provide several predictions, which are in good agreement with experimental data and suggest that there is natural complementarity between auditory and motor processing within a perceptuo-motor theory of speech perception."

Some authors claim that actively encoding objects improves their representation in episodic memory. Conversely, episodic memory has also been shown to improve in passive conditions, suggesting that the action itself could interfere with the encoding process. This study looks at the impact of attention and action on episodic memory using a novel what-where-when (WWW) task that includes information about object identity (what) and spatial (where) and temporal (when) properties. With this approach, we studied the episodic memory of 2 types of objects: a target, where attention or an action is defined, and a distractor, an object to be ignored, following 2 selective states: active versus passive selection. When targets were actively selected, we found no evidence of episodic memory enhancement compared to passive selection; instead, memory from irrelevant sources was suppressed. The pattern was replicated across a 2-D static display and a more realistic 3-D virtual environment. This selective attention effect on episodic memory was not observed on nonepisodic measures, demonstrating a link between attention and the encoding of episodic experiences.

Second, we tested the measurement invariance of the instruments between pediatric and adult burn survivor samples. Third, possible differences in structural parameters across groups were tested. Fourth, we tested whether the three perceived stigmatization factors and the social comfort factor loaded on one second-order factor. Participants included 369 pediatric and 347 adult burn survivors. RESULTS: The four-factor model was superior to the comparison models. The PSQ and SCQ demonstrated measurement invariance. Factor variance, factor covariance, and the latent means of the PSQ did not vary across groups. The adult group had a significantly lower latent mean on the SCQ than the pediatric group.

Late-identified reading deficits were heterogeneous; some children were weak in both comprehension and word-level processing, whereas others had deficiencies in 1 component of reading but were unimpaired in the other. Although most reading skill deficits were about as severe for late- as for early-identified RD, and profiles of associated characteristics were similar, few of the former had yet been identified by their schools. Third-grade achievement, retrospectively examined, had been higher for the group with late-identified RD, suggesting that their reading difficulties were not just late identified but actually late emerging. A great deal of knowledge and understanding about children’s reading disabilities has been amassed over the past few decades. The focus of most research has been early-emerging difficulties that are identified prior to the fourth grade. As noted by Chall (1983), however, there also occurs a smaller “second wave” of students who appear to undergo a “fourth-grade slump” in reading achievement. There has been almost no investigation of the nature and severity of these less typical reading disabilities (RD) that emerge after the primary grades. In this study, we compared the reading and spelling abilities and literacy-related skills of children with early- versus late-emerging RD. In practice, during the elementary and middle school years, there is typically an increasing emphasis on reading comprehension in curricula, instruction, and assessments (Anderson, Hiebert,"

According to a stereotype, people who wear glasses are more intelligent, but less attractive. In a series of four experiments, we showed how full-rim and rimless glasses, differing with respect to the amount of face they cover, affect face perception, recognition, distinctiveness, and the attribution of stereotypes. Eyeglasses generally directed observers’ gaze to the eye regions; rimless glasses made faces appear less distinctive and resulted in reduced distinctiveness in matching and in recognition tasks. Moreover, the stereotype was confirmed but depended on the kind of glasses – rimless glasses yielded an increase in perceived trustworthiness, but not a decrease in attractiveness. Thus, glasses affect how we perceive the faces of the people wearing them and, in accordance with an old stereotype, they can lower how attractive, but increase how intelligent and trustworthy people wearing them ap..."

Five studies provide support for the hypothesis that these self-regulatory strategies differ for individuals with distinct self-construal patterns that encourage one or another from of goal pursuit. Specifically, individuals with a dominant independent self-construal were predicted to place more emphasis on promotion focused information, whereas those with a dominant interdependent self-construal were predicted to place more emphasis on prevention focus. Support for this hypothesis was obtained for participants who scored high versus low on the Independent-Interdependent scale in the U.S., participants from a western (U.S.) versus eastern (Hong Kong) culture, and participants across cultures who were presented with an independent versus interdependent situation (e.g., individual versus team event). Moreover, the moderating role of interdependence upon regulatory focus could be seen in both importance ratings of promotion vs. prevention framed information, and affective responses consistent with promotion or prevention focus. These results, robut across distinct operationalizations of self-construal, are discussed in light of cultural differences in socialization, self-enhancement motives, and optimism and pessimism. Finally, the findings also underscore the malleability of self-construal within the individual, and may thus help predict when distinct self-regulatory strategies will be invoked."

In contrast, work in philosophy of science suggests that analogical inference is also guided by causal models of the source and target. In 3 experiments, the authors explored the possibility that people may use causal models to assess the strength of analogical inferences. Experiments 1–2 showed that reducing analogical overlap by eliminating a shared causal relation (a preventive cause present in the source) from the target increased inductive strength even though it decreased similarity of the analogs. These findings were extended in Experiment 3 to cross-domain analogical inferences based on correspondences between higher order causal relations. Analogical inference appears to be mediated by building and then running a causal model. The implications of the present findings for theories of both analogy and causal inference are discussed."

Children (N = 151 10-year-olds) were tested twice, 1 year apart, and were administered tests of updating capacities (2 complex span and 1 running span task), computation (from the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test), patterns (function machine, number patterns), and algebraic word problems. Proficiencies on the patterns and computational tasks predicted algebraic proficiency. Proficiencies on the computational and patterns tasks are, in turn, predicted by updating capacity. These findings suggest that algebraic reasoning may be difficult if the child has poor updating capacity and either poor facility with computation or difficulty in recognizing and generalizing rules about patterns."

Fifty-six male students who comprised these groups performed a battery of cognitive tests: memory, speed of information processing, visual perception, and attention.

Despite the large body of research surrounding the topic, varying theories as to the time course and function of this recoding still exist. The present review synthesizes this body of research, addressing the topics of time course and function in tandem. The varying theories surrounding the function of phonological coding (e.g., that phonological codes aid lexical access, that phonological codes aid comprehension and bolster short-term memory, or that phonological codes are largely epiphenomenal in skilled readers) are first outlined, and the time courses that each maps onto (e.g., that phonological codes come online early [prelexical] or that phonological codes come online late [postlexical]) are discussed. Next the research relevant to each of these proposed functions is reviewed, discussing the varying methodologies that have been used to investigate phonological coding (e.g., response time methods, reading while eye-tracking or recording EEG and MEG, concurrent articulation) and highlighting the advantages and limitations of each with respect to the study of phonological coding. In response to the view that phonological coding is largely epiphenomenal in skilled readers, research on the use of phonological codes in prelingually, profoundly deaf readers is reviewed. Finally, implications for current models of word identification (activation�verification model, Van Orden, 1987; dual-route model, e.g., M.

These relatively chronic theories can be experimentally altered, and can be affected by parent or teacher feedback. Little is known about whether people might selectively shift their implicit beliefs in response to salient situational goals. We predicted that, when motivated to reach a desired conclusion, people might subtly shift their implicit theories of change and stability to garner supporting evidence for their desired position. Any motivated context in which a particular lay theory would help people to reach a preferred directional conclusion could elicit shifts in theory endorsement. We examine a variety of motivated situational contexts across 7 studies, finding that people�s theories of change shifted in line with goals to protect self and liked others and to cast aspersions on disliked others. Studies 1�3 demonstrate how people regulate their implicit theories to manage self-view by more strongly endorsing an incremental theory after threatening performance feedback or memories of failure. Studies 4�6 revealed that people regulate the implicit theories they hold about favored and reviled political candidates, endorsing an incremental theory to forgive preferred candidates for past gaffes but leaning toward an entity theory to ensure past failings �stick� to opponents. Finally, in Study 7, people who were most threatened by a previously convicted child sex offender (i.e., parents reading about the offender moving to their neighborhood) gravitated most to the entity view that others do not change. Although chronic implicit theories are undoubtedly meaningful, this research reveals a previously unexplored source of fluidity by highlighting the active role people play in managing their implicit theories in response to goals.

Heckhausen & P. M. Gollwitzer, 1987) were analyzed in patients with frontal lesions, patients with nonfrontal lesions, and university students. In Study 1, reflective action control in terms of goal selection was assessed, and impaired deliberation was found in patients with frontal lesions. Study 2 assessed reflexive action control in terms of automatic action initiation as a result of forming implementation intentions (P. M. Gollwitzer, 1999). All participants sped up their responses to critical stimuli by forming implementation intentions. Moreover, lesion patients with weak performances on the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task did worse than patients with strong TOH performances in Study 1 but better than control participants in Study 2. Findings are interpreted as a functional dissociation between conscious reflective action control and automatic reflexive action control. Patients with frontal lobe damage are often unable to cope with everyday life despite their unaffected performance in tests of intelligence, language, memory, and perception (Grattan & Eslinger, 1991). This discrepancy has stimulated various models describing the planning and action control deficits in patients with frontal brain lesions. For a long time, the frontal lobes have been considered to be involved in regulating and programming behavior (e.g., Harlow, 1896/1993; Luria, 1962, 1973; Pribram, 1987; Pribram & Tubbs, 1967). Hierarchical models of brain functioning (Stuss & Benson, 1986; Tranel, Anderson, & Benton, 1994) assume that executive functions (including anticipation, goal selection, planning, monitoring, and use of feedback), located in the prefrontal cortex, control the lower level fixed functional systems (e.g., attention, memory).

The anatomical risk index was significantly associated with broad cognitive ability (Pearson r = .53, p < .0001), reading comprehension (r =.58, p <.0001), and a measure of nonverbal reasoning (r =.39, p < .01), but not with age, parental socioeconomic status, symptom measures, alcohol use, or processing speed.

Oral comprehension skills accounted for a unique variance in reading comprehension at every time point examined. Motivational orientations started to make unique contributions to subsequent decoding accuracy, reading comprehension and arithmetic from preschool onwards, over and above the effects of prior linguistic and math skills. High task orientation was beneficial for beginning reading, whereas high social dependence orientation was detrimental for reading comprehension and arithmetic.

In a longitudinal study using brain event-related potentials (ERPs) we investigated 1) whether dyslexic children with familial risk background would show atypical pitch processing from birth and 2) how these newborn ERPs later relate to these same children’s pre-reading cognitive skills and literacy outcomes. Auditory ERPs were measured at birth for tones varying in pitch and presented in an oddball paradigm (1100 Hz, 12%, and 1000 Hz, 88%). The brain responses of the typically reading control group children (TRC group, N = 25) showed clear differentiation between the frequencies, while those of the group of reading disability with familial risk (RDFR, 8 children) and the group of typical readers with familial risk (TRFR, 14 children) did not differentiate between the tones. The ERPs of the latter two groups differed from those of the TRC group. However, the two risk groups also showed a differential hemispheric ERP pattern. Furthermore, newborn ERPs reflecting passive change detection were associated with phonological skills and letter knowledge prior to school age and with phoneme duration perception, reading speed (RS) and spelling accuracy in the 2nd grade of school. The early obligatory response was associated with more general pre-school language skills, as well as with RS and reading accuracy (RA). Results suggest that a proportion of dyslexic readers with familial risk background are affected by atypical auditory processing. This is already present at birth and also relates to pre-reading phonological processing and speech perception. These early differences in auditory processing could later affect phonological representations and reading development. However, atypical auditory processing is unlikely to suffice as a sole explanation for dyslexia but rather as one risk factor, dependent on the genetic profile of the child."

Specifically, communicators focus more on the costs of deception to them—for example, the guilt they feel when they break a moral rule—whereas targets focus more on whether deception helps or harms them. As a result, communicators and targets make asymmetric judgments of prosocial lies of commission and omission: Communicators often believe that omitting information is more ethical than telling a prosocial lie, whereas targets often believe the opposite. We document these effects within the context of health care discussions, employee layoffs, and economic games, among both clinical populations (i.e., oncologists and cancer patients) and lay people.

By fostering perspective taking, viewing action abstractly also related to empathizing with and expressing willingness to help nonstigmatized and stigmatized others (e.g., AIDS patients; Studies 3-5) and to donating money to help those in need (Study 6).

Notwithstanding the popularity of the rehearsal notion, there have been few detailed examinations of its underlying mechanisms. We explicitly implemented rehearsal in a decay model and explored its role by simulation in several benchmark paradigms ranging from immediate serial recall to complex span and delayed recall. The results show that articulatory forms of rehearsal often fail to counteract temporal decay. Rapid attentional refreshing performs considerably better, but so far there is scant empirical evidence that people engage in refreshing during STM tasks. Combining articulatory rehearsal and refreshing as 2 independent maintenance processes running in parallel leads to worse performance than refreshing alone. We conclude that theoretical reliance on articulatory rehearsal as a causative agent in memory may be unwise and that explanatory appeals to rehearsal are insufficient unless buttressed by quantitative modeling."

Children with SSD were classified as SSD-only, SSD with LI but without childhood apraxia of speech (SSD + LI/No CAS), and CAS and LI (CAS + LI). The SSD-only group did not differ in spelling from the No SSD/LI group, suggesting that SSD-only did not increase risk for poor spelling.

The present experiments investigated why handwriting practice facilitates visual categorization by comparing 2 hypotheses: that handwriting exerts its facilitative effect because of the visual-motor production of forms, resulting in a direct link between motor and perceptual systems, or because handwriting produces variable visual instances of a named category in the environment that then changes neural systems. We addressed these issues by measuring performance of 5-year-old children on a categorization task involving novel, Greek symbols across 6 different types of learning conditions: 3 involving visual-motor practice (copying typed symbols independently, tracing typed symbols, tracing handwritten symbols) and 3 involving visual-auditory practice (seeing and saying typed symbols of a single typed font, of variable typed fonts, and of handwritten examples). We could therefore compare visual-motor production with visual perception both of variable and similar forms. Comparisons across the 6 conditions (N = 72) demonstrated that all conditions that involved studying highly variable instances of a symbol facilitated symbol categorization relative to conditions where similar instances of a symbol were learned, regardless of visual-motor production. Therefore, learning perceptually variable instances of a category enhanced performance, suggesting that handwriting facilitates symbol understanding by virtue of its environmental output: supporting the notion of developmental change though brain-body-environment interactions.

One possible source of information for children is the pretender’s behaviors. Pretender behaviors may vary systematically across real and pretend scenarios, perhaps signaling to toddlers to interpret certain events as not real. Pretender behaviors were examined in 2 experiments in which mothers were asked both to pretend to have a snack and really to have a snack with their 18-month-olds. Episodes were analyzed for condition differences in verbal and nonverbal behaviors, including smiling, looking, laughter, and functional movements. Reliable differences were found across conditions for several variables. In a 3rd experiment, children’s apparent understanding of pretense in relation to their mothers’ behaviors was examined, and significant associations were found with some of the mothers’ behavioral changes but not others. This work provides a first inroad into the issue of how children learn to interpret pretense acts as pretense. Pretend play is a significant activity of childhood, noted for its conceptual links to many of those activities that some consider hallmarks of the human species. It appears to involve the symbolic capacity, like language, because one entity represents another entity (Piaget, 1945/1962; Werner & Kaplan, 1963). Several researchers have noted pretending’s links to hypothetical reasoning, planning, and creativity (Bretherton, 1984; Harris, 2000; Kavanaugh & Harris, 1999; Rubin, Fein, & Vandenberg, 1983).

Research to date has not provided a clear description of their nature, extent, mechanisms, and duration. To investigate the impairments and factors that could influence their identification and severity, the present meta-analysis brings together research on this topic in adult cancer patients. METHOD: Our random-model meta-analysis includes 44 studies investigating the cognitive performance of adults treated with chemotherapy for non-central nervous system malignancies, primarily breast and testicular cancer. We conducted several subgroup analyses to identify the level of cognitive impairments in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. We also pursued several multilevel model regressions to investigate the impact of methodological (study quality) and clinical moderators (diagnosis, age, time since treatment) on the observed effect sizes. RESULTS: Cognitive impairments were found in cross-sectional studies in immediate free recall, delayed memory, verbal memory, delayed recognition memory, selective attention, and attention capacity. Surprisingly, prior to chemotherapy, patients performed better than matched controls. In longitudinal studies, patients' performance increased from baseline to follow-up, an effect that was stronger in patients than controls. None of the chosen moderators influenced the magnitude of estimated summary effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood to identify impairments rests on the type of design employed, as memory and attention impairments are only detected in cross-sectional studies. We discuss the lack of significant impact of moderators on the effect sizes despite the heterogeneity of results, while providing recommendations toward decreasing the heterogeneity in future studies."

Students may interact with scientific phenomena during these out-of-school experiences, providing additional opportunities for learning to take place. Prior studies have found that optional science experiences have positive effects on science knowledge and attitudes. However, these studies do not always account for initial differences between students who are able to participate in many optional experiences and those who cannot. Moreover, many studies focus on high-quality science programs, which may not be representative of the average out-of-school experience. Using a longitudinal dataset of 3,700 6th and 8th grade students in urban and suburban schools from two regions in the United States, the current study investigates the effects of typically occurring optional science experiences during the school year on the development of science knowledge and attitudes. Using propensity score matching, we matched participating and nonparticipating students for characteristics that drive self-selection into these experiences, then analyzed separately for effects of school-related versus home-related science learning experiences. Stable patterns across analytic models reveal growth in science attitudes with both school- and home-related science experiences, but a greater relative decline in science knowledge with school-related science experiences. Thus, typically occurring optional science experiences can influence students’ attitudes and knowledge, but the effects can vary by the type of experience that students attend.

The present meta-analysis included 75 studies yielding 237 effect sizes that examined associations between peers' smoking and adolescents' smoking initiation and continuation with longitudinal designs across 16 countries. Mixed-effects models with robust variance estimates were used to calculate weighted-mean Odds ratios. This work showed that having peers who smoke is associated with about twice the odds of adolescents beginning (OR ¯ = 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.76, 2.19]) and continuing to smoke (OR ¯ = 1.78, 95% CI [1.55, 2.05]). Moderator analyses revealed that (a) smoking initiation was more positively correlated with peers' smoking when the interpersonal closeness between adolescents and their peers was higher (vs. lower); and (b) both smoking initiation and continuation were more positively correlated with peers' smoking when samples were from collectivistic (vs. individualistic) cultures. Thus, both individual as well as population level dynamics play a critical role in the strength of peer influence. Accounting for cultural variables may be especially important given effects on both initiation and continuation.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the current study compared morphological processing in a RD group (11-13-years old) to an age-matched typically developing (TD) group. Participants made semantic relatedness judgments to incongruent word pairs that were either semantically related but did not share a morpheme or semantically unrelated but did share a morpheme. This was compared to conditions where semantic relatedness and morphemic information was congruent. A smaller incongruency effect was found in left dorsal posterior (BA9) and ventral anterior (BA47) inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the RD compared to the TD, suggesting that the RD is less sensitive to morphological information. This was a specific deficit as a phonological control task that manipulated congruency between orthography and phonology did not show group differences in the IFG. Moreover, brain activation in the IFG for the incongruency effect in the semantic task was negatively correlated with reading skill for the RD group only, suggesting that higher skill children with RD may rely on a compensatory whole-word strategy by ignoring the morphemic information.

An important corollary of this theory is that the amount of perceptual load determines the vulnerability of the attention system to being captured by completely irrelevant stimuli, predicting larger amounts of capture with low perceptual load than with high perceptual load. This prediction was first confirmed by Forster and Lavie (2008). Here, we report 6 experiments that followed up on those earlier results, where we find that in many cases, the opposite pattern is obtained: attentional capture increased with increasing perceptual load. Given the lack of generalizability of the theory to new experimental contexts with fairly minor methodological differences, we conclude that Perceptual Load may not be a useful framework for understanding attentional capture. The theoretical and applied importance of these findings is discussed. In particular, we caution against using this theory in applied tasks and settings because best-use recommendations stemming from this theory regarding strategies to decrease distractibility may in fact produce the opposite effect: an increase in distractibility (with distractibility being indexed by the magnitude of the capture effect).

We extend prior research with adolescents by examining rehabilitation group composition among adult male incarcerated offenders. METHOD: Data were gathered from institution files of rehabilitation completers (N = 1,832; M age = 33.5; 19% Aboriginal, 68% Caucasian), including general, substance, violent, and sex offenders. Capacities for treatment (including motivation, learning ability, and inhibitory control) were gathered from intake assessments. At the beginning and end of rehabilitation, providers rated program performance. Risk for recidivism and postrelease recidivism were gathered from official files, up to 3 years following release. RESULTS: Group effects accounted for up to 40% of variance in program outcomes. Group features (average group participant risk to reoffend and risk score diversity) significantly interacted with treatment capacities to explain program outcomes. Most models revealed a dampening effect whereby the positive association between capacities and outcome was reduced in groups of higher risk and more risk diverse coparticipants. Group composition typically accounted for 30-38% of variance between groups, but total variance in outcome explained was generally small. Higher average group risk predicted postrelease recidivism among family violence offenders.

However, sound-symbolism has mostly been investigated with nonwords in forced choice tasks, neither of which are representative of natural language. This study uses ideophones, which are naturally occurring sound-symbolic words that depict sensory information, to investigate how sensitive Dutch speakers are to sound-symbolism in Japanese in a learning task. Participants were taught 2 sets of Japanese ideophones; 1 set with the ideophones' real meanings in Dutch, the other set with their opposite meanings. In Experiment 1, participants learned the ideophones and their real meanings much better than the ideophones with their opposite meanings. Moreover, despite the learning rounds, participants were still able to guess the real meanings of the ideophones in a 2-alternative forced-choice test after they were informed of the manipulation. This shows that natural language sound-symbolism is robust beyond 2-alternative forced-choice paradigms and affects broader language processes such as word learning. In Experiment 2, participants learned regular Japanese adjectives with the same manipulation, and there was no difference between real and opposite conditions. This shows that natural language sound-symbolism is especially strong in ideophones, and that people learn words better when form and meaning match. The highlights of this study are as follows: (a) Dutch speakers learn real meanings of Japanese ideophones better than opposite meanings, (b) Dutch speakers accurately guess meanings of Japanese ideophones, (c) this sensitivity happens despite learning some opposite pairings, (d) no such learning effect exists for regular Japanese adjectives, and (e) this shows the importance of sound-symbolism in scaffolding language learning."

We frame our arguments within an investigation of the face-inversion effect—the greater processing disadvantage of inverting faces compared to non-faces. We report data from three simulations and three experiments wherein faces or non-faces are studied upright or inverted in a recognition procedure. The simulations demonstrate that (1) critical conclusions depend on which theory is used to interpret data and (2) dimensional theory is the more flexible and consistent in identifying underlying psychological structures, because dimensional theory subsumes linear theory as a special case.

Processing is considered automatic if it relies on retrieval of stored instances, which will occur only after practice in a consistent environment. Practice is important because it increases the amount retrieved and the speed of retrieval; consistency is important because it ensures that the retrieved instances will be useful. The theory accounts quantitatively for the power-function speed-up and predicts a power-function reduction in the standard deviation that is constrained to have the same exponent as the power function for the speed-up. The theory accounts for qualitative properties as well, explaining how some may disappear and others appear with practice. More generally, it provides an alternative to the modal view of automaticity, arguing that novice performance is limited by a lack of knowledge rather than a scarcity of resources. The focus on learning avoids many problems with the modal view that stem from its focus on resource limitations."

The present study provides a review of the existing literature on the visual verbal connection as measured by two tasks, rapid serial naming and isolated (or discrete-trial) naming speed, as they relate to reading ability. For each identified study, a secondary data analysis was conducted using the provided correlations between serial naming, isolated naming, and reading. The same analysis was repeated for average population-level correlations among these constructs using meta-analytic weighting techniques. Results suggested that isolated naming acts as a suppressor variable in the relation of serial naming with reading, indicating that there exists at least one cognitive component of the serial naming task that is predictive of reading but is not shared with isolated naming speed.

However, the construct being measured by rapid naming is yet undetermined. The Phonological Processing theory suggests that rapid naming relates to reading because of similar demands of access to long-term stored phonological representations of visual stimuli. Some researchers have argued that isolated or discrete-trial naming is a more precise measure of lexical access than serial naming, thus it is likely that any shared variance between these two formats can be attributed to similar lexical access demands. The present study examined whether there remained any variance in reading ability that could be uniquely explained by the rapid naming task while controlling for isolated naming. Structural equation modeling was used to examine these relations within the context of the phonological processing model. Results indicated that serial naming uniquely predicted reading, and the relation was stronger with isolated naming controlled for, suggesting that isolated naming functioned as a suppressor variable in the relation of serial naming with reading."

The method is based on the assessment of non-verbal abilities using video-like interfaces and was compared to more established methodologies in (Papadopoulos, Laouris, Makris, Proceedings of IDA 54th annual conference, San Diego, 2003), such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Watkins et al., Psychol Sch 34(4):309–319, 1997). To do so, various tests have been applied to a population of 134 children aged 7–12 years old. This paper addresses the issue of identifying a minimal set of variables that are able to accurately predict the learning abilities of a given child. The use of Machine Learning technologies to do this provides the advantage of making no prior assumptions about the nature of the data and eliminating natural bias associated with data processing carried out by humans. Kohonen’s Self Organising Maps (Kohonen, Biol Cybern 43:59–69, 1982) algorithm is able to split a population into groups based on large and complex sets of observations. Once the population is split, the individual groups can then be probed for their defining characteristics providing insight into the rationale of the split. The characteristics identified form the basis of classification systems that are able to accurately predict which group an individual will belong to, using only a small subset of the tests available. The specifics of this methodology are detailed herein, and the resulting classification systems provide an effective tool to prognose the learning abilities of new subjects."

This study examined the joint and unique predictive significance of emergent literacy skills for both later emergent literacy skills and reading in two samples of preschoolers. Ninety-six children (mean age = 41 months, SD = 9.41) were followed from early to late preschool, and 97 children (mean age = 60 months, SD = 5.41) were followed from late preschool to kindergarten or first grade. Structural equation modeling revealed significant developmental continuity of these skills, particularly for letter knowledge and phonological sensitivity from late preschool to early grade school, both of which were the only unique predictors of decoding. Reading skills provide a crucial piece of the foundation for children's academic success. Children who read early and well experience more print exposure and consequent growth in numerous knowledge domains (Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997; Echols, West, Stanovich, & Zehr, 1996; Morrison, Smith, & DowEhrensberger, 1995). In contrast, children who lag behind in their reading skills receive less practice in reading than other children do (Allington, 1984), miss opportunities to develop reading comprehension strategies (Brown, Palincsar, & Purcell, 1986), often encounter reading material that is too advanced for their skills (Allington, 1984), and may acquire negative attitudes about reading itself (Oka & Paris, 1986). Such processes may lead to what Stanovich (e.g., 1986) termed a Matthew effect, in which poor reading skills impede learning in other academic areas (Chall, Jacobs, & Baldwin, 1990), which increasingly depend on reading across the school years.

Results: Linguistic and cognitive abilities predicted reading comprehension. A measure of reading speed (the reading time of pseudo-words) was the best predictor of reading comprehension when assessed by the PROLEC-R test. However, measures of word recognition (the orthographic choice task) and verbal working memory were the best predictors of reading comprehension when assessed by means of the DARC test. Conclusion: These results show, on the one hand, that reading speed and word recognition are better predictors of Spanish language comprehension than reading accuracy. On the other, the reading comprehension test applied here serves as a critical variable when analyzing and interpreting results regarding this topic."

A battery of reading achievement, sound-symbol processing, and speech and language tests were administered before and after treatment. A multiple regression model was developed to determine whether aspects of the sample's diagnostic profile before treatment could predict differential response to the DS, OWLS, and CSS treatments. Factor analysis of the pre- and posttest battery resulted in a 24-variable solution with four factors: reading/spelling, rapid automatized naming, phonological processing, and language. A multiple regression equation was constructed in which the criterion variable was posttest reading/spelling and the predictor variables included pretest reading/spelling, treatment group, an independent pretest variable (Factors 2, 3, 4, Verbal IQ, Performance IQ or age), and interaction terms for pretest reading/spelling × group and for the pretest independent variable × group. From six multiple regressions, three interactions of the latter type were obtained. Pretest language. Verbal IQ, and Performance IQ were found to predict differential response to the present three treatments, although the amount of posttest variance accounted for was small.

On foundational word reading skills (standardized measures), children who received intervention earlier, in 1st and 2nd grade, made gains relative to controls almost twice that of children receiving intervention in 3rd grade. At follow-up, the advantage of 1st grade intervention was even clearer: First graders continued to grow at faster rates over the follow-up years than 2nd graders on 6 of 8 reading outcomes. For some outcomes with metalinguistic demands beyond the phonological, however, a posttest advantage was revealed for 2nd Grade Triple participants and for 3rd Grade Triple participants relative to controls. Estimated IQ predicted growth during intervention on 7 of 8 outcomes. Growth during follow-up was predicted by vocabulary and visual sequential memory. These findings provide evidence on the importance of early intensive evidence-based intervention for reading problems in the primary grades.

Few connections have been drawn between these 2 families of models. In this study, the authors show how psychological concepts originating in the classic signal-detection theory (SDT), a small-world approach to decision making, can be used to understand the workings of a class of simple models known as fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs). Results indicate that (a) the setting of the subjective decision criterion in SDT corresponds directly to the choice of exit structure in an FFT; (b) the sensitivity of an FFT (measured in d) is reflected by the order of cues searched and the properties of cues in an FFT, including the mean and variance of cues’ individual ds, the intercue correlation, and the number of cues; and (c) compared with the ideal and the optimal sequential sampling models in SDT and a majority model with an information search component, FFTs are extremely frugal (i.e., do not search for much cue information), highly robust, and well adapted to the payoff structure of a task. These findings demonstrate the potential of theory integration in understanding the common underlying psychological structures of apparently disparate theories of cognition."

Whereas previous research suggests that anti-egalitarians (vs. egalitarians) dispositionally exhibit less empathy for others, we propose that this relationship depends on the target’s position in the social hierarchy. We examined this question across eight studies (N = 3,154) conducted in the U.S. and the U.K., including online and in-person experiments and examining attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. We observed that (anti-)egalitarianism negatively predicted empathy for members of disadvantaged groups subjected to harmful situations, but positively predicted empathy for members of advantaged groups. This pattern held regardless of perceivers’ own membership in advantaged or disadvantaged groups (i.e., perceiver gender, race, or SES). (Anti-)egalitarianism’s differential effects on empathy for advantaged versus disadvantaged targets were attributable in part to differences in perceived degree of harm incurred (beyond roles for perceived value conflict and perceived deservingness): Egalitarians perceived the same action as more harmful than anti-egalitarians when it occurred to a disadvantaged target but less harmful than anti-egalitarians when it occurred to an advantaged target. We also explored how these patterns informed individuals’ downstream policy attitudes and policy-relevant behavior (e.g., willingness to sign a petition). Our findings enrich understanding of (anti-)egalitarianism by testing competing perspectives on the link between (anti-)egalitarianism and empathy, and by demonstrating when and why individuals’ preferences for social equality (vs. hierarchy) lead them to extend versus withhold empathy.

Most previous applications have used a multilevel manifest covariate (MMC) approach, in which the observed (manifest) group mean is assumed to be perfectly reliable. This article demonstrates mathematically and with simulation results that this MMC approach can result in substantially biased estimates of contextual effects and can substantially underestimate the associated standard errors, depending on the number of L individuals per group, the number of groups, the intraclass correlation, the sampling ratio (the percentage of cases within each group sampled), and the nature of the data. To address this pervasive problem, the authors introduce a new multilevel latent covariate (MLC) approach that corrects for unreliability at L2 and results in unbiased estimates of L2 constructs under appropriate conditions. However, under some circumstances when the sampling ratio approaches 100%, the MMC approach provides more accurate estimates. Based on 3 simulations and 2 real-data applications, the authors evaluate the MMC and MLC approaches and suggest when researchers should most appropriately use one, the other, or a combination of both approaches."

Latencies were longer for long-vowel words than for short-vowel words in lexical decision but not in naming. Further, lexical decision on long-vowel words benefited more from identity priming than lexical decision on short-vowel words, suggesting that representations of long-vowel words achieve activation thresholds more slowly.

Though emotions play a central role in many forms of prosocial behavior, no work has investigated how emotions influence behavior when one has the opportunity to tell a prosocial lie-a situation that presents a conflict between two prosocial ethics: lying to prevent harm to another, and honesty, which might also provide benefits to the target of the lie. Here, we examine whether the emotion of compassion influences prosocial lying, and find that compassion causally increases and positively predicts prosocial lying. In Studies 1 and 2, participants evaluated a poorly written essay and provided feedback to the essay writer. Experimentally induced compassion felt toward the essay writer (Study 1) and individual differences in trait compassion (Study 2) were positively associated with inflated feedback to the essay writer. In both of these studies, the relationship between compassion and prosocial lying was partially mediated by an enhanced importance placed on preventing emotional harm. In Study 3, we found moderation such that experimentally induced compassion increased lies that resulted in financial gains for a charity, but not lies that produced financial gains for the self. This research illuminates the emotional underpinnings of the common yet morally complex behavior of prosocial lying, and builds on work highlighting the potentially harmful effects of compassion-an emotion typically seen as socially beneficial.

An open question is what are the consequences of this learning for cognition and perception? Here, we present a series of experiments that examine effects of verbal labels on the activation of conceptual information as measured through picture verification tasks. We find that verbal cues, such as the word “cat,” lead to faster and more accurate verification of congruent objects and rejection of incongruent objects than do either nonverbal cues, such as the sound of a cat meowing, or words that do not directly refer to the object, such as the word “meowing.” This label advantage does not arise from verbal labels being more familiar or easier to process than other cues, and it does extends to newly learned labels and sounds. Despite having equivalent facility in learning associations between novel objects and labels or sounds, conceptual information is activated more effectively through verbal means than through non-verbal means. Thus, rather than simply accessing nonverbal concepts, language activates aspects of a conceptual representation in a particularly effective way. We offer preliminary support that representations activated via verbal means are more categorical and show greater consistency between subjects. These results inform the understanding of how human cognition is shaped by language and hint at effects that different patterns of naming can have on conceptual structure."

In order to disentangle effects of morphological, semantic, and phonological relatedness, target verbs were combined (e.g., zahlen - to count) with four context verbs: Two morphologically related context verbs that were either semantically transparent (verzahlen - to miscount) or semantically opaque (erzahlen - to tell), a semantically related (rechnen - to calculate) and a phonologically related (zahmen - to tame) context verb. Morphologically related complex verbs reduced picture naming latencies as well as lexical decision latencies. Semantically related verbs did not show any reliable effects. In production, morphological facilitation was almost four times larger than phonological facilitation. In comprehension, pure form overlap produced inhibition. We argue that in German, production and comprehension processes operate on morphologically decomposed lexical form representations. Independent from semantic transparency, complex verbs are broken down into their morphemes during comprehension and are assembled during production. Keywords: language production, language comprehension, verbs, morphology, picture-word interference, cross-modal priming An English speaking person will hardly ever hear or say the compound antidisestablishmentarianism or high voltage electricity grid systems supervisor (Aronoff & Fudemann, 2005). Nonetheless, listeners easily understand these words because they can be analysed into smaller units, so-called morphemes. A morpheme can be defined as the smallest linguistic unit with a grammatical function (Aronoff & Fudeman, 2005). How words consisting of multiple morphemes are processed and represented is the topic of hot debate (e.g., Bentin & Feldman, 1990; Butterworth, 1983; Feldman & Soltano, 1999; Feldman, Soltano, Pastizzo, & Francis, 2004; Frost, Forster, & Deutsch, 1997; Taft, 2004; Zwitserlood, 1994a). Some suggest that morphologically complex words are represented as undivided entities, while others propose that complex words are composed during production and decomposed during comprehension. The many studies on the comprehension side have taught us a lot about the representation of morphologically complex words. However, only few production studies concentrate on morphology. In our research, we considered the representational structure of morphologically complex words within a unitary framework of language use, that is, in speaking and comprehension. We consider such a combined investigation to be an important cornerstone for the advance of general theories on linguistic representation and language use. In particular, we assessed whether lexical access involves morphological composition during word production and morphological decomposition during comprehension. Only a few studies explicitly compared morphological processing in production and comprehension. Baayen, Levelt, Schreuder, & Ernestus (2008) investigated the production of singular- or plural-dominant nouns. In addition, they reanalysed lexical decision data obtained by Baayen, Dijkstra, & Schreuder (1997) using continuous predictors instead of dichotomized predictors (high vs. low frequency). They observed a facilitatory lexeme frequency effect in production and comprehension. They suggest that such abstract representation is accessed first. There are even more fine-grained aspects of a word indicating that the mental lexicon captures regularities present in environment over and above frequency, for instance the entropy and the relative entropy of inflectional paradigms (Baayen, Feldman, & Schreuder, 2006; Baayen et al., 2008; Milin, Durdevic, & Moscoso del Prado Martin, 2009). Such subtle aspects contradict assumptions in which decomposed constituents of a morphologically complex word are recombined at a later stage (Taft & Ardasinski, 2006). …"

Here, we present 2 experiments conducted in Natal, Brazil, that extend this line of research. Experiment 1 tested if the brightness distortion effect would generalize to a Brazilian population. Experiment 2 tested if speech accent would have a similar effect on brightness perception.

In Experiment 2, we found that speech accent influenced brightness perception in a similar manner: Faces were perceived to be darker when paired with an accent associated with low socioeconomic status than when they were paired with an accent associated with high socioeconomic status. Whereas racial concepts in Brazil are often claimed to be much more fluid compared with the United States, our findings suggest that the populations are quite similar with respect to associations between facial features and skin tone.

Some are better than others at this, which may be explained by mode of thought, among other factors. Specifically, it may be that empathically-accurate people tend to rely more on intuitive rather than systematic thought when perceiving others. Alternatively, it may be the reverse--that systematic thought increases accuracy. In order to determine which view receives empirical support, we conducted four studies examining relations between mode of thought (intuitive versus systematic) and empathic accuracy. Study 1 revealed a lay belief that empathic accuracy arises from intuitive modes of thought. Studies 2-4, each using executive-level professionals as participants, demonstrated that (contrary to lay beliefs) people who tend to rely on intuitive thinking also tend to exhibit lower empathic accuracy. This pattern held when participants inferred others' emotional states based on (a) in-person face-to-face interactions with partners (Study 2) as well as on (b) pictures with limited facial cues (Study 3). Study 4 confirmed that the relationship is causal: experimentally inducing systematic (as opposed to intuitive) thought led to improved empathic accuracy. In sum, evidence regarding personal and social processes in these four samples of working professionals converges on the conclusion that--contrary to lay beliefs --empathic accuracy arises more from systematic thought than from gut intuition."

The present study set out to determine the precise impact of language impairment on word reading skills. We investigated single-word reading in 27 French children with specific speech and language impairment (2SLI). Precise quantification of reading levels in the 2SLI group showed an average delay of 3.5 years. Approximately 90% of these children were affected by a reading disorder, whereas for the remaining 10%, reading performance was within normal limits. Word reading procedures are analyzed using the so-called ‘dual route model’, which proposes that reading is achieved through two processes, the phonological and the orthographic procedures. Group comparison analyses of 27 reading level-matched control children, revealed an increased lexicality effect in the 2SLI group, indicating a specific deficit in the phonological procedure. Moreover, multiple case analyses revealed interindividual differences among the children with 2SLI, with four reading subtypes. Approximately 60% of these children reached the standard levels expected of younger children with identical reading levels (delayed reading profile) in both procedures. Twenty percent displayed qualitatively different reading mechanisms, with a greater deficit in the phonological procedure (phonological profile). These children showed a severe impairment in language production at the phonological level. Ten percent exhibited a greater orthographic deficit (surface profile) and 10% had normal reading skills (normal profile). Further research is required to improve our understanding of the relationships between 2SLI or specific language impairment and reading acquisition. The present results suggest that in clinical practice, both reading procedures should be exercised, with emphasis on the phonological procedure for children with more severe deficits in phonological production."

We therefore examined longitudinal associations between child fear/BI and PE and parental depression, and children's cortisol stress reactivity, in 205 7-year-olds. Paternal depression and child fear/BI predicted greater cortisol stress reactivity at a follow-up of 164 9-year-olds, and maternal depression and child PE interacted to predict children's cortisol reactivity, such that higher child PE predicted lower cortisol reactivity in the context of maternal depression.

Distractor words, which were phonologically related or unrelated to the context object's name, were used to determine whether the context object had become phonologically activated. All objects had high frequency names, and the ease of processing of these objects was manipulated by a visual degradation technique. In Experiment 1, both objects were nondegraded; in Experiment 2, both objects were degraded; and in Experiment 3, either the target object or the context object was degraded. Distractor words, which were phonologically related to the context objects, interfered with the naming response when both objects were nondegraded, indicating that the context objects had become phonologically coactivated. The effect vanished when both objects were degraded, when only the context object was degraded, and when only the target object was degraded. These data demonstrate that the amount of available processing resources constrains the forward cascading of activation in the conceptual-lexical system. Context objects are likely to become phonologically coactivated if they are easily retrieved and if prioritized target processing leaves sufficient resources."

Participants read short narratives and thought aloud with an instruction to either explain, predict, associate, or understand. The think-aloud protocols were used to predict sentence reading times for other participants who read silently with the same strategies. The results indicated that readers are capable of strategically controlling the inferences that they generate. However, strategic control comes at some cost in that it limits the resources devoted to other inferences. Furthermore, strategic processing is heavily constrained by a text. Text-based explanations occurred when there was an identifiable causal antecedent in the prior text. Knowledge-based inferences occurred when there were no antecedents and when new characters and objects were introduced. These effects occurred across reading strategies. Reading to explain led to better memory, but only when reading silently."

Yet, there are no a priori reasons why linear relations should be expected over nonlinear ones, which represent a much larger set of all possible associations. Using 2 techniques, quadratic and generalized additive models, we tested for linear and nonlinear associations of general intelligence (g) with 10 personality scales from Project TALENT (PT), a nationally representative sample of approximately 400,000 American high school students from 1960, divided into 4 grade samples (Flanagan et al., 1962). We departed from previous studies, including one with PT (Reeve, Meyer, & Bonaccio, 2006), by modeling latent quadratic effects directly, controlling the influence of the common factor in the personality scales, and assuming a direction of effect from g to personality. On the basis of the literature, we made 17 directional hypotheses for the linear and quadratic associations. Of these, 53% were supported in all 4 male grades and 58% in all 4 female grades. Quadratic associations explained substantive variance above and beyond linear effects (mean R² between 1.8% and 3.6%) for Sociability, Maturity, Vigor, and Leadership in males and Sociability, Maturity, and Tidiness in females; linear associations were predominant for other traits. We discuss how suited current theories of the personality�intelligence interface are to explain these associations, and how research on intellectually gifted samples may provide a unique way of understanding them. We conclude that nonlinear models can provide incremental detail regarding personality and intelligence associations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)"

In contrast, in the present work, early handwriting is viewed as involving a suite of perceptual, motor and cognitive abilities, which must work in unison if children are to write letters efficiently. To study such coordination, head-mounted eye-tracking technology was used to investigate the process of visual-motor coordination while kindergarten children (N=23) and adults (N=11) copied individual letters and strings of letters that differed in terms of their phonemic properties. Results indicated that kindergarten children were able to copy single letters efficiently, as did adults. When the cognitive demands of the task increased and children were presented with strings of letters, however, their ability to copy letters efficiently was compromised: children frequently interrupted their writing mid-letter, whereas they did not do so on single letter trials. Yet, with increasing age, children became more efficient in copying letter strings, in part by using vision more prospectively when writing. Taken together, the results illustrate how the coordination of perceptual, motor and cognitive processes contributes to advances in the development of letter writing skill."

The Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP; Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005) is one prominent implicit measure that has been widely used in this and other work. However, the status of the AMP as a measure of unintentional responding has been a matter of debate, which necessarily also raises questions about the “implicitness” of the updated responses within recent person impression research. In re-analyses of published work, we identify multimodal distributions of AMP responses that raise concerns about potential intentional influences on this task. Drawing on 8 new studies, however, we find that such patterns are not likely attributable to intentional responding (Studies 1, 2A–2B), and that methodological modifications to the AMP procedure eliminate bimodality but do not eliminate effects of rapid revision (Studies 3A–6). Furthermore, these modifications provide evidence that the rapid-revision effects reported in earlier work can be produced under suboptimal conditions such as distraction and increased vigilance against prime influence. We advocate for the continued use of judgmental misattribution as a valuable tool in the arsenal of implicit social cognition researchers, but also encourage researchers to continue to examine the distributional patterns of measures like the AMP, and what those patterns might reflect.

Seventy Greek children were followed from kindergarten until grade 4. In kindergarten they were tested in non-verbal intelligence, vocabulary, phonological sensitivity, rapid naming, and letter knowledge. The parents of the children also responded on a questionnaire regarding the frequency of storybook reading, the number of books at home, and the frequency of teaching letter names, sounds, and words. Reading fluency and comprehension were measured in grade 4. The results indicated that the early home literacy experience variables were related to the emergent literacy skills but did not directly predict future reading skills. Thus, the Home Literacy Model applies to consistent orthographies before any formal reading instruction takes place."

Teachers who reported a higher emphasis on didactic instruction tended to refer more children to the transition room. In addition, there were lower levels of involvement for parents of transition-referred children. Moreover, referred children were younger, evaluated their own school abilities less favorably, scored lower on the Gesell Developmental Assessment, and were described by their teachers as less competent academically and less well adjusted socially. The referral of children to a readiness-transitional program is a complex process. Embedded in a sociocultural context, this process is shaped by many forces, including the school system's philosophies and structures; the teachers' views, beliefs, and activities; the family-school connection; and children's skills and characteristics. Despite the controversy surrounding the issue of nonpromotion and its variant, the transition room, school districts across the nation continue to promote these placements as sound educational choices for at-risk students. Seventy-two percent of U.S. schools use transition rooms, kindergarten retention, or both (Love, Logue, Trudeau, & Thayer, 1992). As an alternative to first-grade placement, schools with transition programs assign 13% of their kindergartners to these classrooms (Love et al., 1992). This figure is higher in some states (i.e., New Hampshire) where the average transition room placement of children is reported to be approximately 28% (Gredler, 1992)."

START,START,1973851830,does attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have a dimensional latent structure a taxometric analysis,2011,"david k marcus, tammy d barry",journal of abnormal psychology,1,110,21,"ADHD is one of the most commonly diagnosed childhood disorders, affecting approximately 8% of school-age children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) distinguishes among three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined type. Although there has been progress in diagnosing, understanding, and treating ADHD, researchers are far from a comprehensive etiological model of the disorder and a number of issues remain unresolved. For example, is ADHD best understood as arising from a single core deficit (e.g., Barkley, 1997) or can it be better explained by a multiple pathway model (e.g., Sonuga-Barke, 2002)? Although ADHD is frequently comorbid with other conditions such as conduct problems, the precise relation between ADHD and these related conditions remains in question (e.g., Waschbusch, 2002). Also unresolved is whether ADHD is a qualitatively distinct category (i.e., a taxon) or whether it is better understood as existing on a continuum, which is the focus of this investigation.

There has been ongoing debate about whether childhood disorders, in general, are better conceptualized dimensionally or as categories. Beauchaine (2003) noted that developmental psychopathologists generally prefer dimensional models for a variety of reasons, including that dimensional systems may better capture developmental processes (as opposed to categories that identify presumptively immutable outcomes) and because categories may minimize the importance of situational influences. It is, however, worth noting that some developmental processes, such as puberty, may be categorical, and situational influences can contribute to taxonic conditions (e.g., cancers resulting from a combination of a genetic diathesis and an environmental carcinogen). In terms of assessment, Achenbach and McConaughy (1997) advocated for classifying childhood disorders quantitatively and Achenbach’s (1991a) Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is a frequently used dimensional measure of child psychopathology. Consistent with a dimensional approach, Fergusson and Horwood (1995) found that continuous measures of externalizing behaviors were better predictors of subsequent substance abuse and delinquent behaviors, than were DSM-III-R diagnoses. However, Cantwell (1996) defended the value of categorical approaches both for identifying rare disorders and for their pragmatic value. Ultimately, whether a specific “disorder represents a discrete entity is an empirical question that cannot be settled through methodological convention or philosophical debate” (Beauchaine, 2003, p. 503), or as noted by Sonuga-Barke (1998), “particular categories of disorder should be seen as scientific hypotheses that can be tested using taxometric analysis” (p. 116).

Sonuga-Barke (2005) noted that knowing whether ADHD is a discrete category or a continuous trait is critical to identifying causal models for ADHD. Many experts believe that ADHD is best understood dimensionally (e.g., “the dimensional approach to ADHD seems most consistent with the available evidence” Barkley, 2006, p. 96). Additionally, multiple pathway models of ADHD (e.g., Nigg, Goldsmith, & Sachek, 2004; Sonuga-Barke, 2005) are likely to be more consistent with a dimensional latent structure than with a taxonic latent structure. A number of studies provide indirect support for a dimensional conceptualization. Delays and variability in processing speed are linearly distributed from typical controls, to children with borderline ADHD, to those with ADHD (Kalff et al., 2005). A meta-analysis on genetic and environmental influences on ADHD symptoms stated that “examination of behavioral dimensions as opposed to diagnostic subtype categories may provide a more clear and consistent answer as to potential etiological differences between” symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity (Nikolas & Burke, 2010, p. 2).

Nevertheless, these findings do not address the question of latent structure directly. Although it appears that various indicators of ADHD (e.g., processing speed, inattention, response inhibition) are continuously distributed, dimensional indicators can be symptoms of a taxonic condition (e.g., fever as an indicator of influenza). Furthermore, ADHD may have a taxonic latent structure even if there are varying levels of severity within the taxon (e.g., mild and severe cases of influenza may be caused by the same pathogen). In fact, there appears to be consensus that the question of whether ADHD is categorical or continuous is both important and unresolved (e.g., Levy, McStephen, & Hay, 2001; Nigg et al., 2002; Sonuga-Barke, 1998; Stevenson et al., 2005).

Some studies have used latent class analysis (LCA) to examine the structure of ADHD. The primary aim of these studies has been to clarify the subtypes of ADHD (e.g., is there a pure hyperactive-impulsive subtype?), and only a few of these studies have explicitly addressed the question of whether ADHD or its subtypes are categorical or dimensional. Hudziak et al. (1998) examined the latent structure of ADHD symptoms in a sample of female adolescent twins. They analyzed parent reports of DSM-IV ADHD symptoms and found evidence of three separate dimensions (inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and combined). Each dimension was continuously distributed and there was no evidence to suggest that ADHD or any of these subtypes were categorical. In their LCA of parent interview data, Neuman et al. (1999) found evidence of inattentive and combined subtypes. Both subtypes were continuously distributed in their sample, again suggesting that ADHD is not taxonic. However, Todd et al. (2001) found greater heritability within than across latent class ADHD subtypes, which they took as possible evidence that the various latent classes may be categorical.

Ultimately, LCA is useful for identifying subgroups, but because researchers are left to interpret whether the latent classes are qualitatively or quantitatively distinct, LCA does not directly test whether a construct is taxonic or dimensional. In contrast, Meehl’s (e.g., Ruscio, Haslam, & Ruscio, 2006; Waller & Meehl, 1998) taxometric method appears to be a more accurate method for identifying a construct’s latent structure. There have been two prior taxometric analyses of ADHD. Haslam et al. (2006) examined the latent structure of ADHD in two large epidemiological samples, one of children and one of adolescents. They used two taxometric procedures to analyze indicators drawn from parent reports on the CBCL and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children. A clear majority of the findings were more consistent with a dimensional than a taxonic structure, and overall, this study provided support that ADHD has a dimensional latent structure.

Frazier, Youngstrom, and Naugle (2007) examined the latent structure of ADHD symptoms in a clinical sample of individuals referred for ADHD evaluations, 72% of whom were subsequently diagnosed with ADHD. The taxometric analyses used a range of indicators including parent reports, intelligence and achievement test results, and results from the Connors’ Continuous Performance Task (CPT). Frazier et al.’s analytic strategy involved performing separate taxometric analyses for each domain of symptoms (e.g., one set of analyses for CPT performance and another set for IQ indexes), as well as analyses using a mixture of indicators across domains. Consistent with Haslam et al. (2006), Frazier and colleagues concluded that ADHD has a dimensional structure.

Despite the lack of evidence to fully support qualitatively distinct subgroups of individuals with or without ADHD, the conceptualization and treatment of ADHD as categorical is still held strongly within much current research—particularly in fields, such as genetic and psychiatric research (e.g., Acosta et al., 2008; Althoff et al., 2006). For example, Elia and colleagues (2009) identified six ADHD phenotypes via LCA that they described as homogenous groups that could be used in future genetic research. Similarly, a categorical conceptualization remains the way that ADHD is diagnosed clinically based on the current DSM-IV-TR and the proposal criteria for the DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association, 2010). Thus, based on extant research it may be that categorical views of ADHD have been disproportionately influential on shaping ADHD research and diagnosis and additional research on the latent structure of ADHD is needed to clarify existing ideas and practices.

The present study bridges the gap between the Haslam et al. and Frazier et al. studies by using (a) indicators drawn from a wide range of domains and methods with (b) a general population sample of individuals. We conducted a set of taxometric analyses using parent and teacher ADHD symptom reports and measures of cognitive and executive functions as indicators. These data were collected as part of a multi-site population-based study. In addition, we tested the validity of our taxometric findings by comparing the utility of dimensional versus categorical models of ADHD on their ability to predict features associated with ADHD (for the importance of validating taxometric findings see Waldman & Lilienfeld, 2001; Watson, 2006). More specifically, we examined whether continuous scoring of ADHD symptoms or dichotomous classification systems accounted for more variance in known correlates of ADHD."

Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST) suggests that with increasing age, positive emotions become more meaningful, and emotional meaningfulness matters more for situation selection. Other developmental descriptions suggest that negative affect may be meaningful and interesting in youth. In Study 1, United States 18–86 year olds read descriptions of TV programs that varied in levels of warmth, funniness, sadness, and fright; in Study 2, United States and German 18–82 year olds watched film trailers that varied in levels of gore and meaningfulness. Participants rated their anticipated emotions, anticipated meaningfulness of the content, and their viewing interest. Consistent with SST, in both studies, anticipated meaningfulness was a stronger predictor of viewing interest for older adults relative to younger adults, and the indirect path (Emotion → Meaning → Interest) was stronger for older relative to younger adults. In Study 1, warmth (but not funniness) was more predictive of meaningfulness for older relative to younger adults; sadness and fear were not more predictive of meaningfulness for younger adults. In Study 2, there were age differences in the effects of fright on interest, in part via effects on anticipated fun and suspense (but not arousal). Overall, the results provide limited evidence that positive or negative emotions are more meaningful or interesting at different ages. However, they support the argument that emotional meaningfulness matters more to older than to younger adults."

Little is known about the origins of these individual differences. The current study investigated the genetic and environmental contributions to identity formation. In total, 571 11-year-old twins (85 monozygotic complete pairs and 176 dizygotic complete pairs) reported on their identity formation, using the Dimensions of Identity Development Scale (DIDS; Luyckx, Schwartz, Berzonsky, et al., 2008), as part of the Longitudinal Israeli Study of Twins (LIST; Avinun & Knafo, 2013). Multidimensional scaling analysis and confirmatory factor analysis supported the presence of all 5 dimensions at this young age: commitment making, exploration in-breadth, ruminative exploration, identification with commitment, and exploration in-depth. However, a model where exploration in-depth was divided into two subscales had a better fit to the data. Monozygotic twins were more similar to each other than dizygotic twins on all dimensions, except for one of the exploration in-depth subscales, supporting the idea that individual differences in various dimensions of identity formation are at least partially influenced by genetics (18-45%). For these dimensions, the rest of the variance was explained by nonshared environment effects (55-82%). Only one of the exploration in-depth subscales, that is, the tendency to explore commitments through discussion with others, showed evidence for the influence of the environment shared by twins (21%) but no genetic effect.

People who evaluated disgust (or joy) less favorably than others were less likely to expose themselves to disgusting (or joyful) pictures (Study 1). These links were emotion-specific and could not be explained by differences in state or trait emotion (Study 2) or in emotional reactivity (Study 3). We were further able to show that the choice of emotion-inducing stimuli affected emotional experience in a congruent manner. People with more (vs. less) negative attitudes toward disgust (or sadness) were more likely to avoid disgusting (or sad) stimuli, resulting in more intense experiences of disgust (or sadness; Study 2). Finally, people with more negative attitudes toward disgust chose to avoid more disgusting stimuli, whether attitudes were assessed explicitly or implicitly (Study 3). These findings suggest that people avoid stimuli that induce emotions that they evaluate less favorably, even when such evaluations are not consciously accessible. (PsycINFO Database Record"

For example, the parent of a child displaying problematic behavior has to decide whether this behavior is likely related to mental health concerns and necessitates professional care. The process of identifying mental health concerns is made more complicated by the rich background of real-world environmental factors or contexts in which concerns can present—contexts that might or might not relate to the presence of mental health concerns. We investigated whether laypeople use contextual information to make judgments regarding childhood mental health disorder symptoms. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that laypeople’s judgments of the likelihood of a mental disorder are influenced by non-diagnostic contextual information that surrounds symptoms of the disorder. In Experiment 2, we demonstrated that providing a causal origin for such disorder symptoms accentuates the use of context, regardless of the nature of the causal process (i.e., environmental vs. biological). These findings indicate that contextual influences on judgments about mental health concerns may reflect a more general set of mental reasoning processes than indicated by previous work focused on clinicians’ judgments. Consequently, these findings have important implications for how we think about the influence of contextual information on decision making more generally as well as for improving our ability to both reliably identify children in need of mental health care and increase children’s access to such care."

Encoder is a connectionist model that learns to convert images like the fixated text images human readers encode into the corresponding letter sequences. The computational theory of classification learning predicts that fixated text-image size makes this learning difficult but that reducing image variability and biasing learning should help. Encoder confirms these predictions. It fails to learn as image size increases but achieves humanlike visual encoding accuracy when image variability is reduced by regularities in fixation positions and letter sequences and when learning is biased to discover mapping functions based on the sequential, componential structure of text.

In Experiments 2A and 2B higher levels of brain activation were found for ambiguous sentences compared with unambiguous sentences matched for syntactic complexity, even when the ambiguities were resolved in favor of the preferred syntactic construction (despite the absence of this difference in previous reading time results). Although results can be reconciled with either serial or parallel models of sentence parsing, they arguably fit better into the parallel framework. Serial models can admittedly be made consistent but only by including a parallel component. The fMRI data indicate the involvement of a parallel component in syntactic parsing that might be either a selection mechanism or a construction of multiple parses. Functional neuroimaging provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into the processing of linguistic ambiguity, because it indicates how much brain activity is associated with the comprehension of different types of ambiguous and comparable unambiguous sentences. Purely behavioral studies have easily demonstrated that being led down a linguistic “garden path” (being led to interpret an ambiguity in favor of a more likely but ultimately incorrect interpretation) results in longer processing times and larger error probabilities, but these studies cannot provide a measure of the amount of computation that is being performed per unit time. fMRI offers a proxy for amount of computation per unit time, namely the amount of brain activity per unit time. With a singlesentence, event-related, experimental design, the present fMRI study provided a measurement of the amount of brain activity every 1,500 ms for different types of ambiguous and unambiguous sentences."
START,START,2055177553,reenacting the route to interpretation enhanced perceptual identification without prior perception,1992,"michael e j masson, colin m macleod",journal of experimental psychology general,1,139,91,"Memory for processing a stimulus event may be expressed indirectly through more fluent processing of that stimulus on a later occasion. In 11 experiments, enhanced identification of words presented under visual masking was measured following events that involved reading target words or generating them from semantic cues. Amount of enhancement was related not to whether a word was actually seen on its first presentation, but to the degree to which it was integrated with its encoding context—integration led to less enhancement. It is proposed that 2 sets of operations are carried out during encoding. Interpretive encoding operations construct a context-sensitive interpretation of the stimulus and are optionally followed by elaborative encoding operations. Enhanced word identification due to memory for a prior episode is determined by the fluent reenactment of interpretive encoding operations applied during that episode. In their everyday use of the word, people usually think of remembering as a single act. This is evident in the frequent analogy to locating a book on a library shelf: The routine is done essentially the same way every time. But cognitive psychologists have shown over and over that, as appealing as the library analogy may be, it is not appropriate for describing memory. Remembering is not a single routine; it is a family of skills that we learn to use alone or in combination to meet the demands placed on us by our contexts. To understand memory, then, a key step will involve categorizing different types of remembering, finding commonalities among superficially different acts of remembering. In the past decade, this enterprise has focused particularly on a distinction between two ways of remembering—the deliberate recollection of specific episodes and the fluent application of memory for past experience to current task performance. Situations in which we deliberately attempt to remember have been called direct or explicit tests of memory (Richardson"

However, in laboratory studies, findings are mixed and often reveal no age differences. In the current series of experiments, we examined whether age differences in risk seeking are more likely to emerge when choices include a certain option (a sure gain or a sure loss). In four experiments, we found that age differences in risk preferences only emerged when participants were offered a choice between a risky and a certain gamble but not when offered two risky gambles. In particular, Experiments 1 and 2 included only gambles about potential gains. Here, compared with younger adults, older adults preferred a certain gain over a chance to win a larger gain and thus, exhibited more risk aversion in the domain of gains. But in Experiments 3 and 4, when offered the chance to take a small sure loss rather than risking a larger loss, older adults generally exhibited more risk seeking in the domain of losses than younger adults. In a nutshell, our findings suggest that older adults weigh certainty more heavily than younger adults."

A number of theories of sentence comprehension make a clear distinction between knowledge that is encoded in the lexicon, versus world or event knowledge (Bornkessel & Schlesewsky, 2006; Chomsky, 1975; Katz, 1972; Schlesinger, 1995; Sperber & Wilson, 1986). On these accounts, the first is linguistically relevant knowledge, and is used rapidly in the time-course of understanding sentences. The second is not represented within the linguistic system, but instead is part of a comprehender's general knowledge about events (see Jackendoff, 2002, for a summary of this distinction). That is, semantic knowledge, including people's knowledge of generalized events in the world, is activated more slowly than lexical (or syntactic) knowledge, and thus is used only after a short delay (Bornkessel & Schlesewsky, 2006; Clifton & Staub, 2008; Frazier, 1995; van Gompel, Pickering, Pearson, & Liversedge, 2005). In stark contrast, other researchers claim that event-based knowledge is used immediately during on-line sentence comprehension (Delong, Urbach, & Kutas; 2005; Garnsey, Pearlmutter, Myers, & Lotocky, 1997; Kamide, Altmann, & Heywood, 2003; McRae, Spivey-Knowlton, & Tanenhaus, 1998; van Berkum, Brown, Zwitserlood, Kooijman, & Hagoort, 2005; Vu, Kellas, Petersen, & Metcalf, 2003).

One key theoretical construct that is central to this debate is that of selectional restrictions. Selectional restrictions refer to knowledge of semantic constraints on verbs' arguments, primarily patients (the entities or objects on which an action is performed). One example of a selectional restriction is ±animacy, which is assumed to be stored in the lexical representations of verbs such as convince, reflecting the fact that only animate entities can be convinced (Chomsky, 1965). Furthermore, many researchers argue that selectional restrictions are syntactic in nature, which is an additional reason why they have temporal precedence over more general event-based knowledge (Bornkessel & Schlesewsky, 2006). Although there have been divergent views as to whether selectional restrictions reflect syntactic or semantic knowledge, in many theories, they are considered as lexical information that is temporally privileged in terms of access and use during sentence comprehension. The notion of selectional restrictions has played a central role in interpreting the results of numerous sentence comprehension studies (Altmann & Kamide, 1999; Caplan, Hildebrandt, & Waters, 1994; Trueswell, Tanenhaus, & Garnsey, 1994; Warren & McConnell, 2007).

The purpose of this article is to investigate further the proposed architecturally-determined delay in the use of the general cognitive knowledge of aspects of events. In doing so, we focus on empirical results that recently have been used to argue that event-based knowledge is delayed relative to linguistically-relevant knowledge of selectional restrictions (Warren & McConnell, 2007)."

In the current research, we draw upon the literature on implicit theories of relationships to develop and validate a scale examining 2 types of lay beliefs about how sexual satisfaction can be maintained over time. Individuals high in sexual growth beliefs think that sexual satisfaction is attained from hard work and effort, whereas individuals high in sexual destiny beliefs think that sexual satisfaction is attained through finding a compatible sexual partner. Across 6 studies (2 cross-sectional online studies, a 21-day daily experience study, 2 dyadic studies, and an experimental manipulation; N = 1,896), we find evidence that those higher in sexual growth beliefs experience higher relationship and sexual satisfaction, and have partners who are more satisfied. Conversely, the effects of sexual destiny beliefs on satisfaction are contingent upon signs of partner compatibility: When individuals high in sexual destiny beliefs experience greater sexual disagreements in their relationship, they experience lower relationship quality. These results are independent of general relationship implicit beliefs, providing evidence for the uniqueness of these 2 constructs and the importance of examining implicit beliefs in the domain of sexuality. Overall, these results provide novel evidence that individuals’ lay beliefs about maintaining sexual satisfaction are important for understanding the quality of their sex lives and relationships.

Our results suggest that children with a double deficit are at great risk of developing dyslexia unless they receive specific support. Moreover, the results of the intervention study are the first to show how German speaking children with a double deficit can be adequately supported within the framework of standard beginners’ reading and writing lessons in inclusive classrooms so that impending difficulties in the acquisition of written language can be successfully prevented.

Our study shows that the nature of repetition matters. Specifically, although both negated repetition and affirmative repetition improve memory compared with no repetition, negated repetition hinders memory compared with affirmative repetition. After showing participants different entities, we asked them about features of these entities, leading to either “yes” or “no” responses. Our findings show that correctly negating an incorrect feature of an entity elicits an active forgetting effect compared with correctly affirming its true features. For example, after seeing someone drink a glass of white wine, answering “no” to “was it red wine?” may lead one to greater memory loss of the individual drinking wine at all compared with answering “yes” to “was it white wine?” We find this negation-induced forgetting effect in 4 experiments that differ in (a) the meaning given for the negation, (b) the type of stimuli (visual or verbal), and (c) the memory measure (recognition or free recall). We discuss possible underlying mechanisms and offer theoretical and applied implications of the negation-induced forgetting effect in relation to other known inhibition effects."

Methods: The present study was designed to explore whether additional evidence for a cognitive phenotype emerged from a larger sample.

Data from these boys were compared to data from 15 typically developing boys individually matched on age and grade in school to each of the 15 boys with Barth syndrome. Results: Although boys with Barth syndrome had age-appropriate performance on all measures of reading-related skills, their performance on mathematics and visual spatial tasks was significantly lower than that of boys in the compar- ison group. Moreover, specific aspects of visual short-term memory also differed from available norms. Con- clusion: Our findings support the validity of the preliminary findings and reflect a higher incidence of cognitive difficulties in boys with Barth syndrome relative to boys in the comparison group.

Experts were very willing to testify, but more so for the prosecution than the defense when interview suggestibility was low and vice versa when interview suggestibility was high. Experts' anticipated testimony focused more on prodefense aspects of the police interview and child's memory overall (negativity bias), but favored retaining party only when interview suggestibility was low. Prosecution-retained experts shifted their focus from prodefense aspects of the case in the high suggestibility interview to proprosecution aspects in the low suggestibility interview; defense experts did not. Blind raters' perceptions of expert focus mirrored those findings. Despite an initial bias toward retaining party, experts' evaluations of child victim accuracy and police interview quality were lower in the high versus low interview suggestibility condition only. Our data suggest that adversarial allegiance exists, that it can (but not always) influence how experts process evidence, and that it may be more likely in cases involving evidence that is not blatantly flawed.

First, if they can be identified, cores can be tested early to distinguish those children who might be at risk for reading difficulties, helping prevent and remediate dyslexia. Second, training of such core abilities might facilitate more optimal word recognition and word writing over time. In other words, identifying such core abilities can suggest more effective ways to teach early Chinese literacy skills.

Both tasks of morphological awareness predicted unique variance in Chinese character recognition in these children, after controlling for age, phonological awareness, speeded naming, speed of processing, and vocabulary. Developmentally, both tasks of morphological awareness improved with age. Results demonstrate that morphological awareness is uniquely important for early Chinese character recognition."

Although those low and high in SP in kindergarten had substantially different word-decoding scores by the middle of first grade (low: M = 6.8 words; high: M = 18.1 words), this difference was no longer significant once phonological processing was controlled, suggesting that the effect of SP on word decoding is mediated by phonological processing ability."

Past research suggests that people with high self-esteem are more expressive and self-disclosing because they trust that others care for them and will not reject them (Gaucher et al., 2012). However, feeling good about oneself may not always be enough; disclosure may also depend on how we feel about other people. Drawing on the principles of risk regulation theory (Murray et al., 2006), we propose that agreeableness—a trait that refers to the positivity of interpersonal motivations and behaviors—is a key determinant of trust in a partner’s caring and responsiveness, and may work in conjunction with self-esteem to predict disclosure. We examined this possibility by exploring how both self-esteem and agreeableness predict a particularly risky and intimate form of self-disclosure, the disclosure of emotional distress. In 6 studies using correlational, partner-report, and experimental methods, we demonstrate that self-esteem and agreeableness interact to predict disclosure: People who are high in both self-esteem and agreeableness show higher emotional disclosure. We also found evidence that trust mediates this effect. People high in self-esteem and agreeableness are most self-revealing, it seems, because they are especially trusting of their partners’ caring. Self-esteem and agreeableness were particularly important for the disclosure of vulnerable emotions (i.e., sadness; Study 5) and disclosures that were especially risky (Study 6). These findings illustrate how dispositional variables can work together to explain behavior in close relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"

The model consists of a large number of simple processing elements which send excitatory and inhibitory signals to each other via modifiable connections. Information processing is thought of as the process whereby patterns of activation are formed over the units in the model through their excitatory and inhibitory interactions. The memory trace of a processing event is the change or increment to the strengths of the interconnections that results from the processing event. The traces of separate events are superimposed on each other in the values of the connection strengths that result from the entire set of traces stored in the memory. The model is applied to a number of findings related to the question of whether we store abstract representations or an enumeration of specific experiences in memory. The model simulates the results of a number of important experiments which have been taken as evidence for the enumeration of specific experiences. At the same time, it shows how the functional equivalent of abstract representations--prototypes, logogens, and even rules--can emerge from the superposition of traces of specific experiences, when the conditions are right for this to happen. In essence, the model captures the structure present in a set of input patterns; thus, it behaves as though it had learned prototypes or rules, to the extent that the structure of the environment it has learned about can be captured by describing it in terms of these abstractions."

On average, students make much greater reading gains in 1st grade than they do in kindergarten. First-grade monthly reading growth averages 2.65 points per month, whereas kindergarteners make approximately 1.67 points of reading growth per month. Student-level variables (including socioeconomic status, ethnicity, kindergarten entry age, and gender) were better able to explain between-schools variability in students' initial reading scores and students' reading growth than school-level variables (percentage of minority students, percentage of free-lunch students, and sector). Although socioeconomic status had a minimal impact on reading growth while school was in session, it had a larger impact on summer reading growth. These results suggest that between-schools differences in achievement are largely explained by the differences in school clientele, rather than differences in instruction or resource allocation. These results also underscore the potential importance of preschool and summer programs for low-socioeconomic status children."

Relational encoding improved recall for low-interest stories but not high-interest stories; the reverse pattern was obtained with a manipulation encouraging extensive processing of the individual propositions. We suggest that interesting stories free up resources for relatively optional organizational processing of the text elements, thereby rendering additional relational processing redundant (for recall). Less interesting stories require more resources to keep attention focused on encoding the individual propositions, thereby rendering additional proposition-specific processing redundant."

The experiments reported here tested the hypothesis that autobiographical elaboration during study (i.e., generating autobiographical memories in response to cue words) would lead to more distinctive recollections than other item-specific encoding tasks, enhancing retrieval monitoring accuracy at test. Consistent with this hypothesis, false recognition was less likely when participants had to search their memory for previous autobiographical elaborations, compared to previous semantic judgments. These false recognition effects were dissociated from true recognition effects across four experiments, implicating a recollection-based monitoring process that was independent from familiarity-based processes. Separately obtained subjective measures provided converging evidence for this conclusion. The cognitive operations engaged during autobiographical elaboration can lead to distinctive recollections, making them less prone to memory distortion than other types of deep or semantic encoding."

Studies 1-4 revealed that social comparisons, temporal comparisons, and other self-enhancing cognitions (i.e., attributions, disidentification, relationship evaluations) are more likely to be mood incongruent when people adopt a reflective orientation to their negative feelings and more likely to be mood congruent when they adopt a ruminative orientation.

An advantage for low-frequency words emerged in both associative and item recognition at very low levels of learning. This early emergence casts doubt on explanations based on the traditional concept of recollection. A comparison of false alarms supports a role for item information or the joint use of cues but not familiarity in producing associative false alarms. We may also have found a way to measure the amount of attention being paid to a to-be-learned item or pair, independently of memory performance on the attended item. This result may be an important step in determining whether coherent theories about the role of attention in long- and short-term memory can be created."

Dreaming plays a key role as provocateur and shaper of this natality. Additionally, it serves as a vouchsafe for belief; as a transformative force; as a form of divination; and as a source for theological and liturgical information. This article focuses, in particular, on why dreaming in Vodou has received so little scholarly attention.

Little, 1983) was adapted to examine relations between participants' appraisals of their goal characteristics and orthogonal happiness and meaning factors that emerged from factor analyses of diverse well-being measures. In two studies with 146 and 179 university students, goal efficacy was associated with happiness and goal integrity was associated with meaning. A new technique for classifying participants according to emergent identity themes is introduced. In both studies, identity-compensatory predictors of happiness were apparent. Agentic participants were happiest if their goals were supported by others, communal participants were happiest if their goals were fun, and hedonistic participants were happiest if their goals were being accomplished. The distinction between happiness and meaning is emphasized, and the tension between efficacy and integrity is discussed. Developmental implications are discussed with reference to results from archival data from a sample of senior managers. Wisdom literature has long promoted being true to oneself as a desirable alternative to preoccupation with success. Warnings against blind achievement are present in two of the earliest known written records, from about 3,700 years ago. In the Atrahasis epic, the gods punish ""noisy"" ambition with a terrible flood, and in the Gilgamesh epic, personal accomplishments lose their meaning for the protagonist in light of his friend's death (Fisher, 1970; Guirand, 1977, pp. 49-72). Similarly, in the Genesis Tower of Babel story, ambition is punished by confusion, and in Ecclesiastes, achievements are dismissed as vanity and folly. The corollary to these recommendations is represented by injunctions from Greek philosophy that ""the unexamined life is not worth living"" and that one should ""know thyself."" The examples given above converge on a theme so commonplace that it regularly appears in Hollywood films (e.g., ""Regarding Henry,'' ' 'The Doctor,'' and ' 'The Fisher King''). Each of these films features a highly successful character absorbed in his accomplishments until some crisis makes his life feel meaningless."

Why do some children learn to read easily and quickly while others, in the same classroom and taught by the same teacher, don't learn to read at all?

She focuses on reading predictors, analyzing the effect individual differences in specific perceptual, linguistic, and cognitive skills may have on a child's ability to read. Because of the serious methodological problems she finds in the existing research on reading, many of the studies McGuinness cites come from other fields -- developmental psychology, psycholinguistics, and the speech and hearing sciences -- and provide a new perspective on which language functions matter most for reading and academic success. McGuinness first examines the phonological development theory -- the theory that phonological awareness follows a developmental path from words to syllables to phonemes -- which has dominated reading research for thirty years, and finds that research evidence from other disciplines does not support the theory. McGuinness then looks at longitudinal studies on the development of general language function, and finds a ""tantalizing connection"" between core language functions and reading success. Finally, she analyzes mainstream reading research, which links reading ability to specific language skills, and the often flawed methodology used in these studies. McGuinness's analysis shows the urgent need for a shift in our thinking about how to achieve reading success."

To solve this, researchers have posited constraints, and inference strategies, but assume that determining the referent of a novel word is isomorphic to learning. We present an alternative in which referent selection is an online process and independent of long-term learning. We illustrate this theoretical approach with a dynamic associative model in which referent selection emerges from real-time competition between referents and learning is associative (Hebbian). This model accounts for a range of findings including the differences in expressive and receptive vocabulary, cross-situational learning under high degrees of ambiguity, accelerating (vocabulary explosion) and decelerating (power law) learning, fast mapping by mutual exclusivity (and differences in bilinguals), improvements in familiar word recognition with development, and correlations between speed of processing and learning. Together it suggests that (a) association learning buttressed by dynamic competition can account for much of the literature; (b) familiar word recognition is subserved by the same processes that identify the referents of novel words (fast mapping); (c) online competition may allow the children to leverage information available in the task to augment performance despite slow learning; (d) in complex systems, associative learning is highly multifaceted; and (e) learning and referent selection, though logically distinct, can be subtly related.

However, little guidance exists in the published literature regarding techniques for detecting careless responses. Previously several potential approaches have been suggested for identifying careless respondents via indices computed from the data, yet almost no prior work has examined the relationships among these indicators or the types of data patterns identified by each. In 2 studies, we examined several methods for identifying careless responses, including (a) special items designed to detect careless response, (b) response consistency indices formed from responses to typical survey items, (c) multivariate outlier analysis, (d) response time, and (e) self-reported diligence. Results indicated that there are two distinct patterns of careless response (random and nonrandom) and that different indices are needed to identify these different response patterns. We also found that approximately 10%–12% of undergraduates completing a lengthy survey for course credit were identified as careless responders. In Study 2, we simulated data with known random response patterns to determine the efficacy of several indicators of careless response. We found that the nature of the data strongly influenced the efficacy of the indices to identify careless responses. Recommendations include using identified rather than anonymous responses, incorporating instructed response items before data collection, as well as computing consistency indices and multivariate outlier analysis to ensure high-quality data."
START,START,2001513998,concepts and conceptual structure,1989,douglas l medin,american psychologist,1,858,99,"Research and theory on categorization and conceptual structure have recently undergone two major shifts. The first shift is from the assumption that concepts have defining properties (the classical view) to the idea that concept representations may be based on properties that are only characteristic or typical of category examples (the probabilistic view). Both the probabilistic view and the classical view assume that categorization is driven by similarity relations. A major problem with describing cat- egory structure in terms of similarity is that the notion of similarity is too unconstrained to give an account of con- ceptual coherence. The second major shift is from the idea that concepts are organized by similarity to the idea that concepts are organized around theories. In this article, the evidence and rationale associated with these shifts are described, and one means of integrating similarity-based and theory-driven categorization is outlined. What good are categories? Categorization involves treat- ing two or more distinct entities as in some way equivalent"

This was tested by using a design that controlled for artifacts in prior studies. Participants, 191 production workers, their supervisors (N = 17), and 13 managers at a large industrial products plant, completed questionnaires containing measures of job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and work values. Responses were later matched with the attendance and performance records of the production workers in the sample. Results showed that workers were more satisfied and committed when their values were congruent with the values of their supervisor, \felue congruence between workers and their supervisors was not significantly correlated with workers' tenure; however, its effect on organizational commitment was more pronounced for longer tenured employees. The topic of corporate culture has recently captured the interest of practicing managers as well as academic researchers. This appeal is based on the general observation that organizations with strong cultures exhibit superior overall performance (Barney, 1986; Deal & Kennedy, 1982; Kilmann, 1984; Peters & Waterman, 1982). Further evidence for this conclusion has come from accounts of the Japanese system of management (Ouchi, 1981; Pascale & Athos, 1981). These descriptions attribute the high levels of motivation and involvement of Japanese workers, at least in part, to their adoption of the dominant values and company philosophies held by their organizations (Schein, 1981). The superior performance of firms with strong corporate cultures has been ascribed to their use of socialization and other techniques to emphasize specific core values that, when shared by employees (Barney, 1986; Tichy, 1983), are thought to perform certain crucial functions. Schein (1985) has succinctly described these functions as external adaptation and internal integration. In fostering external adaptation, holding these core values is believed to influence employees to behave in ways that are necessary for the organization to survive in its environment. In this mode, values are thought to have a direct effect on the behavior of individuals in the workplace. The role of values in internal integration is quite different,"

In a series of three experiments we investigated syntactic priming using a sentence recall task. Participants read and memorized a target sentence for later recall. After reading a prime sentence and engaging in a distraction task, they were asked to produce the target sentence aloud. Earlier investigations have shown that this task is sensitive to a syntactic priming effect. That is, the syntactic form of the prime sentence sometimes influences the syntactic form of the recalled target. In this paper we report on a variation on this task, using Spanish-English bilingual participants. In the first two experiments we replicated the prepositional phrase priming effect using English target sentences and Spanish prime sentences. In the final experiment we investigated two additional syntactic forms, using Spanish target sentences and English prime sentences. Implications for models of syntax generation and bilingual speech production are discussed."

The authors tested the hypothesis that RT-TRCE reflects activated overlearned response category codes in long-term memory (such as up or left). The results support the hypothesis by showing that (a) RT-TRCE was absent for tasks for which there were no response codes ready beforehand, (b) RT-TRCE was present after these tasks were practiced, and (c) these practice effects were found only if the tasks permitted forming abstract response category codes. The increase in the RT-TRCE with response slowness, found only for familiar tasks, suggests that the abstract response category codes may be verbal or linguistic in these cases. The results are discussed in relation to task-switching theories and prefrontal functions."

The review included both extreme group studies and correlational studies with unselected samples (235 studies were included, and 995 effect sizes were calculated). Results from extreme group comparisons indicated that children with dyslexia show a large deficit on phonemic awareness in relation to typically developing children of the same age (pooled effect size estimate: 1.37) and children matched on reading level (pooled effect size estimate: 0.57). There were significantly smaller group deficits on both rime awareness and verbal short-term memory (pooled effect size estimates: rime skills in relation to age-matched controls, 0.93, and reading-level controls, 0.37; verbal short-term memory skills in relation to age-matched controls, 0.71, and reading-level controls, 0.09). Analyses of studies of unselected samples showed that phonemic awareness was the strongest correlate of individual differences in word reading ability and that this effect remained reliable after controlling for variations in both verbal short-term memory and rime awareness. These findings support the pivotal role of phonemic awareness as a predictor of individual differences in reading development. We discuss whether such a relationship is a causal one and the implications of research in this area for current approaches to the teaching of reading and interventions for children with reading difficulties."

The present study investigated the role of visual-motor integration skills in reading Chinese among children with and without developmental dyslexia. In the study Chinese children with developmental dyslexia (DD-Group), chronological-age-matched children (CA-Group), and reading-level-matched children (RL-Group) were asked to participate in reading and reading related tasks as well as word-copying and picture-copying (visual-motor integration) tasks. The results revealed that the DD-Group performed significantly worse than the CA-Group on the word copying task, and that the DD-Group performed similarly to the RL-Group on the reading and reading related tasks and the word-copying task. However, the DD-Group performed significantly worse than the CA- and RL-Groups on the visual-motor integration task. Further, when age and intelligence were controlled visual-motor integration and word-copying skills could explain 14 and 16% of the variance in reading skills respectively. When reading-related cognitive skills were controlled, visual-motor integration skills could still explain 8% of variance in reading skills, but word-copying skills did not.

Regression analyses controlling for pre-consumption mood, blood alcohol concentration, and all other positive expectancies showed tension reduction expectancies to be a marginally significant positive predictor of negative mood post-drinking. This association was significant only for those who achieved lower blood alcohol concentrations in lab and those who reported less involvement with alcohol (i.e., lower typical quantity, heavy episodic drinking frequency, and years of regular drinking). Findings suggest that associations between expectations for mood and actual post-drinking mood outcomes may operate differently for less versus more involved drinkers.

This study investigates this relation in 20 children (aged 6:6 – 7:11) with word-finding difficulties (WFDs).

Briefly, the composite trace-used as a central construct in such models-can become catastrophically out of control. To solve the problem, a prestorage novelty-familiarity monitor and a simple control procedure need to be implemented. Eight lines of experimental evidence converge on the idea that output from such a novelty-familiarity monitor underlies people's metacognitive judgments of feeling of knowing. Breakdown of the monitoring-control mechanism produces Korsakoff-like symptoms in the model. Impairments in feeling-pf-knowing judgments and the failure to release from proactive inhibition, both characteristic of Korsakoff amnesia, are thus attribute to a monitoring-control failure rather than to deficits in the basic memory system"

The phonological-deficit model of reading disabilities, coupled with the classic dual-route model of word recognition, has led to two predictions: (a) a specific deficit in the pseudoword reading of those with reading disabilities and (b) an absent or reduced regularity effect for those with reading disabilities relative to reading-level controls. Previous reviews confirm the first prediction. The present meta-analysis tested the second prediction. There was a clear effect of word regularity for individuals with reading disabilities, the magnitude of which did not differ from the word regularity effect for reading-level controls. The authors explore how the contradictory support for these 2 predictions is inconsistent with classic dual-route models of word reading and how connectionist models are consistent with the empirical findings on reading disability."

It was argued that priming from the spatial code to the nonspatial code might facilitate the identification of the nonspatial stimulus feature in congruent Simon trials. In the present study, the authors provide evidence that the identification of the nonspatial information can be facilitated by the activation of an associated spatial code. In three experiments, participants first associated centrally presented animal and fruit pictures with spatial responses. Subsequently, participants decided whether laterally presented letter strings were words (animal, fruit, or other words) or nonwords; stimulus position could be congruent or incongruent to the associated spatial code. As hypothesized, animal and fruit words were identified faster at congruent than at incongruent stimulus positions from the association phase. The authors conclude that the activation of the spatial code spreads to the nonspatial code, resulting in facilitated stimulus identification in congruent trials. These results speak to the assumption of a third process involved in the Simon task."

Previous research has shown that the perceived duration of a short scene depicting a disk moving along a segmented path is reduced when the temporal order of the motion segments is reversed (Memento effect). This effect has been attributed to the idea that reversed segments give rise to the perception of distinct visual events, whereas continuous segments are perceived as a single event. It has been suggested that the reduction in perceived duration is a result of perceiving multiple distinct events rather than 1. Here, the authors replicate and investigate the origin of the Memento effect. In 4 experiments, they explore the role of the spatiotemporal predictability of the disk's movement as well as the influence of the number of discrete events on perceived duration. Controlling for spatiotemporal predictability eliminates the Memento effect; however, controlling for the number of distinct events does not. Thus, the authors' results suggest that violations in spatiotemporal predictability rather than a varying number of discrete events induce the Memento effect.

Three methods have been proposed to operationalize this approach: (a) the concordance/discordance method (C/DM; Hale F Flanagan, et al., 2007), and (c) the Discrepancy/Consistency Method (D/CM; Naglieri, 1999). Although often treated as interchangeable, these methods differ in important ways, including: (a) how achievement deficits and cognitive weaknesses are theoretically linked; (b) the role of exclusionary factors that may preclude LD identification (e.g., emotional, economic factors); (c) specified thresholds for achievement deficits; and (d) methods for establishing a cognitive discrepancy.

Proponents contend that PSW methods are important because cognitive assessment can be used to plan treatment and to differentiate students with “specific” learning disabilities from “slow learners” with more global deficits. Despite the strong claims by PSW advocates, empirical studies demonstrating the reliability and validity of PSW methods have been slow to emerge. No published empirical study has investigated the reliability and validity of LD identification decisions resulting from PSW methods. Further, no study has investigated the implementation of these LD identification methods following a determination of inadequate response to intervention, a “hybrid” model that provides early intervention through RTI service delivery models, followed by comprehensive assessment for LD identification for students who demonstrate inadequate response to Tier 2 intervention (Fiorello, Hale, & Snyder, 2010; Hale et al., 2010). In the present study, we utilized a sample of inadequate responders to Tier 2 intervention to investigate: (a) LD identification rates; (b) extent of agreement; and (c) academic attributes of groups resulting from two proposed PSW methods for LD identification: the C/DM and XBA methods. A third proposed PSW method, the D/CM, requires a specific assessment battery (Cognitive Assessment System, Naglieri & Das, 1997) and is therefore not included in the present study."

However, indices of agreement for classification decisions were low ( .29), especially for percent positive agreement (62%). The 2 batteries demonstrated agreement on the academic domain of eligibility for only 25 participants. Cognitive discrepancy frameworks for LD identification are inherently unstable because of imperfect reliability and validity at the observed level. Methods premised on identifying a PSW profile may never achieve high reliability because of these underlying psychometric factors.

Postexperimental debriefings are intended to eliminate such detrimental effects. However, experimentally induced beliefs can persevere even when the underlying information is explicitly discredited. The present research investigates, in the context of ego-threatening manipulations, whether postexperimental debriefings reestablish participants’ prestudy conditions. In 6 studies, participants received false feedback about their intelligence (Studies 1 and 5) or their attractiveness and likability (Studies 2–4 and 6), completed dependent variables indicative of well-being (Studies 1, 2, and 4–6), or aggressive behavior and hostile attributions (Study 3), and were thoroughly debriefed. Participants reported lower well-being and exhibited more hostile attributions after receiving negative compared with neutral or positive feedback. These effects were not eliminated when participants had been debriefed before completing the dependent variables, either in writing (Studies 1–6), in person (Studies 4 and 5), or when additionally writing a self-affirming essay (Studies 4 and 5). A prolonged and extensive personal debriefing (Study 6) was most effective in reducing the aversive effects of ego threat. Follow-up assessments revealed that affective consequences of the ego threat persevered for 2 weeks and longer. Internal meta-analyses corroborated these results, but also showed that all debriefing versions, even if not fully effective, ameliorated the effects of ego threat at least to some extent. Taken together, the present findings illustrate the only partial effectiveness of different debriefing procedures, stress the importance of carefully designing postexperimental debriefings to avoid ethical concerns, and more generally point to potentially effective ways to deal with negative feedback and personal threats.

We compared children with ADHD (mean age 9.78) to word reading-matched controls (mean age 9.89) on their ability to retell a passage. We found that even though children with ADHD recalled more central than peripheral information, they showed their greatest deficit, relative to controls, on central information—a centrality deficit (Miller and Keenan, Annals of Dyslexia 59:99–113, 2009). We explored the cognitive underpinnings of this deficit using regressions to compare how well cognitive factors (working memory, inhibition, processing speed, and IQ) predicted the ability to recall central information, after controlling for word reading ability, and whether these cognitive factors interacted with ADHD symptoms. Working memory accounted for the most unique variance. Although previous evidence for reading comprehension difficulties in children with ADHD have been mixed, this study suggests that even when word reading ability is controlled, children with ADHD have difficulty building a coherent mental representation, and this difficulty is likely related to deficits in working memory."

We used a computational cognitive model to isolate decision-making biases. We hypothesized that suicidal participants would exhibit a relatively elevated bias for making active responses to escape an aversive state and would show worse performance when escape required a passive response (i.e., ""doing nothing"" to escape). Our hypotheses were supported: The computational model revealed that suicidal participants exhibited a higher bias for an active response to escape compared with nonsuicidal psychiatric controls, suggesting that this finding was not just the result of the presence of psychopathology.

Low-frequency distractors produced greater interference on picture naming than did high-frequency distractors. This distractor frequency effect was not affected by manipulations that facilitated or hindered distractor recognition. Interference was reduced for distractors that were read aloud several times prior to being shown in the picture-naming task. Together these findings suggest that the distractor frequency effect has its locus at some stage of lexical access for production. Other findings further constrain hypotheses about which level of speech production is involved in the effect. The distractor frequency effect has implications for models of lexical processing in speaking as well as for accounts of picture–word interference and the frequency effect. Two effects, reliably observed in picture naming, have received much attention from researchers interested in word production: the name frequency and the word interference effects. The first effect refers to the observation that pictures with high-frequency (HF) names are named faster and more accurately than pictures with low-frequency (LF) names (e.g., Oldfield & Wingfield, 1965). The second effect refers to the fact that it takes longer to name a picture when it is shown along with a word. The Stroop effect, obtained in the color-naming task, is perhaps the best known case of word interference. The phenomenon of word interference can be observed with all sorts of pictures (not only colors) and all sorts of words (not only semantically related words; for reviews, see Deyer, 1973; Glaser, 1992; MacLeod, 1991). For example, it takes longer to name the picture dog when it is shown with the word cup compared with when the picture is shown with a nonsense string of letters (e.g., uvc). The interest in the effects of frequency and word interference originates in part from the view that these effects involve the selection of the pictures’ names rather than other stages"

The outcomes support an upward spiral of causality: Children who are more proficient in comprehension and technical reading and spelling skills read more; because of more print exposure, their comprehension and technical reading and spelling skills improved more with each year of education. For example, in preschool and kindergarten print exposure explained 12% of the variance in oral language skills, in primary school 13%, in middle school 19%, in high school 30%, and in college and university 34%. Moderate associations of print exposure with academic achievement indicate that frequent readers are more successful students.

A multilevel modeling approach was used to investigate the influence of age composition in 70 urban preschool classrooms. A series of hierarchical linear models demonstrated that greater variance in classroom age composition was negatively related to development on the Child Observation Record (COR) Cognitive, Motor, and Social subscales. This was true when controlling for class size, general classroom quality, and socioeconomic status at the classroom level and for age, gender, and baseline ability at the child level. Additionally, to address possible concerns related to nonrandom assignment to classrooms, a series of models were run including variance in developmental age (i.e., baseline ability) at the classroom level and at the child level. The results were consistent for chronological age composition and developmental age composition at the classroom level; greater variance in classroom developmental age composition was negatively related to Time 2 scores on the COR Cognitive, Motor, and Social subscales.

Whilst there have been many interventions developed to address this problem, very few of these have been rigorously evaluated. This article presents the findings of a randomised controlled trial that sought to measure the effectiveness of a book gifting programme (the Letterbox Club) that aims to improve literacy skills amongst children aged 7–11years in foster care. The programme involves children receiving six parcels of books sent through the post over a six-month period. The trial, which ran between April 2013 and June 2014, involved a sample of 116 children in Northern Ireland (56 randomly allocated to the intervention group and 60 to a waiting list control group). Outcome measures focused on reading skills (reading accuracy, comprehension and rate) and attitudes to reading and school. The trial found no evidence that the book-gifting programme had any effect on any of the outcomes measured. Drawing upon some of the emergent themes from the accompanying qualitative process evaluation that sought to determine foster carer/child attitude towards and engagement with the parcels, it is suggested that one plausible reason for the ineffectiveness of the Letterbox Club, as intimated by carers and children (rather than explicitly explored with them), is the lack of support provided to the carers/children in relation to the packs received. Reflective of an ecological model of children's development, it is recommended that for book-gifting programmes to be effective they need to include a focus on encouraging the direct involvement of foster carers in shared literacy activities with the children using the books that are gifted."

However, the limited evidence about how this occurs focuses predominantly on behavioral aspects of role modeling and reciprocation. We extend this research by more closely examining how ethical leaders can shape employee behavior via their effect on employees’ moral disengagement — a cognitive orientation that determines how individuals conceive and mentally approach decisions with ethical import. In three integrated studies, we find that ethical leadership decreases employees’ moral disengagement, which in turn mediates the effect of ethical leadership on employees’ deviant behavior and unethical decisions. Further, subordinate moral identity moderates the mediated effect of ethical leaders on subsequent subordinate decisions and misconduct. Whereas results from Study 2 support an “immunity” hypothesis, wherein high moral identity subordinates are less susceptible to less ethical leader behaviors, Study 3 findings support a “virtuous synergy” perspective wherein high moral identity subordinates are susceptible to the influence of moral exemplars. These results provide evidence that ethical leadership matters in employees’ tendencies to morally disengage, and that employees’ moral identity affects this relationship in important ways, with consequential behavioral outcomes for organizations."

To answer this question, we administered a vocabulary subscale from a common intelligence test along with several nonverbal subscales to 15 early-blind adolescents (onset of ≤2 years). Reliability of only the vocabulary test scores was insufficient for high-stakes testing.

In Experiment 2, we assessed whether the effects of disgust were selectively related to social contexts by contrasting interactions with a human partner with those involving a computer. Results showed that relative to being in a sad or neutral mood, induced feelings of disgust significantly increased rejection rates of unfair offers. Moreover, we found that when the partner was not responsible for the fairness violation, such as in the computer-offer condition, the disgust induction failed to affect participants' choices.

We examined whether differences in L2 between the two groups reflect differences in L1 with regard to reading and relevant subskills. In addition, the relationship between reading and its predictors within and across the two languages was investigated. Between group differences were similar in L1 and L2 when task conditions involved high levels of phonological and orthographic complexity or demanded speeded processing. Furthermore, serial rapid naming predicted speeded word reading in both languages and L2 text reading accuracy, while L2 phoneme awareness and orthographic knowledge explained unique variance in L2 text reading accuracy. Cross-linguistic prediction revealed that speeded word reading predicted its counterpart from L1 to L2 and vice versa.

In a lab paradigm, participants received many trials of simulated interpersonal situations in a new culture, each of which required them to make a choice, and then provided them with evaluative feedback about the accuracy of their choice with regard to local norms. Studies 1 to 3 found that participants higher on an individual difference dimension of metacognitive proclivity learned to adhere to the local norms faster. This relationship held up in simple and complex situations, that is, when the feedback was noisy rather than completely reliable, and it also held up when possibly confounding individual differences were controlled (Study 2). Further evidence suggested that the underlying mechanism is the largely implicit process of error monitoring and reactive error-based updating. A measure of surprise (an indicator of error monitoring) mediated the link between metacognitive proclivity and faster learning (Study 3). In experiments that varied the task so as to afford different kinds of metacognitive processing, participants learned faster with posterror prompts but not with postaccuracy prompts (Study 4). Further, they learned faster with nondirected prompts that merely provided a break for processing rather with prompts that directly instructed them to reason explicitly (Study 5). We discuss the implications of these findings for models of culture, first- and second-culture learning, and for training and selecting people for foreign or intercultural roles.

Study 1 showed that compared to a control condition, relative deprivation and relative gratification enhanced implicit discrimination—measured through variations of linguistic abstraction in intergroup descriptions. Whereas both relative deprivation and relative gratification produced linguistic ingroup favoritism, linguistic productions of relatively deprived groups also conveyed outgroup derogation. Study 2 showed that relatively deprived and relatively gratified groups were overtly discriminatory in intergroup allocations of negative outcomes. The effects of relative deprivation were mediated by perceived intergroup rivalry and, in part, by perceived common fate. Perceived common fate partly accounted for the effects of relative gratification. Study 3 focused on mediators of relative gratification. First, members of relatively gratified (vs. control) groups worried about losing the ingroup advantage, which together worked as sequential mediators of discrimination. Second, relatively gratified groups reported higher existential guilt, which, in turn, was related to expectations of discrimination by the relatively deprived outgroup, and these sequentially mediated the effects of relative gratification. Overall, these studies highlight that both relative deprivation and relative gratification enhance intergroup discrimination and contribute to the understanding of the underlying processes."

However, it has not been established whether it is an independent process that contributes to reading performance on its own or whether it is a process that is embedded in other linguistic skills (e.g., phonological awareness or phonological memory) and, therefore, contributing to reading performance indirectly. Research has shown that performance on tasks assessing associative learning, e.g., paired-associate learning (PAL) tasks, is lower in children with specific reading difficulties compared to typical readers. We explored the differential associations of two distinct verbal–visual PAL tasks (the Bala Bbala Graphogame, BBG, and a Foreign Language Learning Task, FLLT) with reading skills (word reading and pseudo-word decoding), controlling for phonological awareness, rapid naming, and letter and digit span in children at risk for reading disabilities and their typically developing peers. Our study sample consisted of 110 children living in rural Zambia, ranging in age from 7 to 18 years old (48.1% female). Multivariate analyses of covariance were used to explore the group differences in reading performance. Repeated-measures ANCOVA was used to examine children's learning across the PAL tasks. The differential relationships between both PAL tasks and reading performance were explored via structural equation modeling. The main result was that the children at risk for reading difficulties had lower performance on both PAL tasks. The BBG was a significant predictor for both word reading and pseudo-word decoding, whereas the FLLT—only for word reading. Performance on the FLLT partially mediated the association between phonological awareness and word reading. These results illustrate the partial independence of associative learning from other reading-related skills; the specifics of this relationship vary based on the type of PAL task administered."

These theoretical assumptions were critical for the development of coding schemes in prominent computational models of word recognition and reading aloud. In a reading-aloud study, we tested whether the human reading system represents the orthographic/phonological onset of printed words and nonwords as single units or as separate letters/ phonemes.

In Study 1 (N = 50), there was no significant difference in learning outcomes between the dialogue and tutoring conditions, while the dialogue condition was superior to the monologue condition. Study 2 (N = 40), which involved a younger population than in Study 1, did not replicate these results, in that students learned less from observing dialogue than from being tutored, and there was no significant difference between the dialogue and monologue conditions.

This analysis showed that in Study 1, the dialogue observers generated more substantive contributions than did the monologue observers. In contrast, in Study 2 there was no significant difference between the observers in terms of substantive contributions; moreover, the total number of contributions was modest, which may have hindered observer learning in that study.

The authors first consider principle-based accounts of these successes and failures, in which early successes imply knowledge of principles and failures are attributed to ancillary deficits. One account is that infants younger than 8 months have the object permanence principle but lack means-ends abilities. To test this, 7-month-olds were trained on means-ends behaviors and were tested on retrieval of visible and occluded toys. Means-ends demands were the same, yet infants made more toy-guided retrievals in the visible case. The authors offer an adaptive process account in which knowledge is graded and embedded in specific behavioral processes. Simulation models that learn gradually to represent occluded objects show how this approach can account for success and failure in object permanence tasks without assuming principles and ancillary deficits."

According to some theorists, retrieval-induced forgetting is the consequence of an inhibitory mechanism that acts to reduce the accessibility of nontarget items that interfere with the retrieval of target items. Other theorists argue that inhibition is unnecessary to account for retrieval-induced forgetting, contending instead that the phenomenon can be best explained by noninhibitory mechanisms, such as strength-based competition or blocking. The current article provides the first major meta-analysis of retrieval-induced forgetting, conducted with the primary purpose of quantitatively evaluating the multitude of findings that have been used to contrast these 2 theoretical viewpoints. The results largely supported inhibition accounts but also provided some challenging evidence, with the nature of the results often varying as a function of how retrieval-induced forgetting was assessed.

Participants were 127 Grade 1 Japanese-speaking children who were followed until Grade 2. The results showed that Grade 1 morphological awareness was uniquely and comparably associated with word reading skills in both Hiragana and Kanji in Grade 1 after controlling for nonverbal and verbal cognitive abilities, phonological awareness, and rapid automatized naming. The effect of Grade 1 morphological awareness on Grade 2 Kanji word recognition was slightly stronger (∆R2 = .10) than the effect on Grade 2 Hiragana reading fluency (∆R2 = .03). The findings suggest that morphological awareness plays an important role in early word reading skills across the two scripts, and with reading skill development it may become more important for mastering morphographic Kanji characters."

First, it demonstrates that the alarm andrepair rules are implicit procedural features of peoples relation-ship representations. In this way, this study illustrates the norma-tive power of the exchange scriptan oft-discussed but littlestudied feature of interdependent life (Berscheid & Regan, 2005).Second, it demonstrates that low and high self-esteem people bothseek supplementary behavioral means of securing their partnerscommitment on those occasions when exchange anxieties areactivatedimplicitly. Third,itdemonstrateshowthecalibrationofthissystem shifts as a function of peoples self-esteem when the exchangescript is consciously deliberated. Finally, this study is one of the firstto demonstrate how low self-esteem people might protect their rela-tionships in the face of persistent rejection anxieties. The Daily Diary Study: Even Newlyweds Need Insurance Does feeling inferior to a partner automatically elicit behavioralefforts to increase the partners dependence? And do such effortsensure that trust is not misplaced by strengthening the partnerscommitment? We posed these questions in a daily diary study ofnewlyweds. We examined whether Sallys inferiority anxiety onMonday predicted her self-sacrificing behaviormundane behaviors,such as looking for Harrys keys, that make her indispensableonTuesday. To provide preliminary, albeit indirect, evidence thatsuch a normative effect is automatic in nature, we estimated thisassociation controlling for Sallys inferiority anxiety on Tuesday.The effect of Mondays inferiority thus captures the effect ofinferiority concerns that do not surface in Sallys explicit reportson Tuesday. Because awareness is thought to be critical for con-scious control in most circumstances, social cognition scholarstypically utilize the lack of such insight as a precondition forestablishing automaticity (Bargh, Chen, & Burrows, 1996; Chen,Fitzsimons, & Andersen, 2007). We expected these uncontrolledinferiority anxieties to trigger dependence promotion regardless ofself-esteem. We also expected Sallys dependence-promoting be-haviors on Tuesday to diminish Harrys doubts about his commit-ment on Wednesday."

After describing the method, it is demonstrated in two content areas in cognitive psychology in which models are highly competitive: retention (i.e., forgetting) and categorization.

We investigated reading difficulties in Kannada among 8–12 year old children by conducting a between-groups followed by a case series analysis. We compared the children with reading difficulties with same age competent readers and younger readers who were similar in language level, matched on measures of vocabulary, syntactic processing, and morphological processing. Reading difficulties were characterized by poor akshara knowledge. Concomitant impairments were in syllable and phoneme level phonological skills, in rapid naming and in oral language skills. The case series analysis highlighted the variability of profiles among poor readers with the most common impairments being in akshara knowledge and phonological processing. Sub-groups of poor readers showed additional deficits in oral language, rapid naming, and visual processing skills. Together our findings indicate that the core deficit associated with reading difficulty in the alphasyllabary of Kannada is in the phonological domain. However, accompanying deficits in related skills, including visual processing, can further inhibit reading attainment. The findings from this study support a multifactorial model of reading development."

Less fluent 9- to 12-year-olds with lower orthographic knowledge were at floor on phoneme tasks, but more fluent readers, with greater orthographic knowledge, showed significant phonemic awareness. Orthographic knowledge, phoneme awareness, and RAN were independent predictors of reading rate and, together with syllable awareness, predicted individual differences in reading accuracy. Taken together, we suggest that increasing alphasyllabic literacy promotes a dual representation at the syllable and phoneme level and that the analytic processes involved in acquiring orthographic knowledge and mappings with phonology are a universal aspect of reading development across languages."

Mixed effects logistic regression models showed that both symbol-level (visual complexity, phonological complexity, frequency) and child-level (phoneme awareness, vocabulary, rapid automatized naming) measures predicted variations in akshara knowledge. Thus predictors of akshara knowledge appear to be related to aspects of both visual and phonological processing. It is argued that the visual complexity of the Kannada script pose somewhat different challenges to the child learning to read than those reported for visually less complex orthographies."

This striking finding in older adults remained significant after controlling for working memory span and for noticing their names in an attended channel. The findings were replicated when presentation rate was made slower and when the ear in which the unattended name was presented was controlled. These results point to an account of older adults’ performance involving not only an inhibition factor, which allows high-span young adults to suppress the channel to be ignored, but also an attentional capacity factor, with more unallocated capacity allowing low-span young adults to notice their names much more often than older adults with comparably low spans."

Results of a latent profile analysis, combining different eye movement parameters, indicated two distinct eye-patterns—fixating and switching patterns. The switching eye-pattern was associated with high mental rotation performance. There were no sex differences in eye-patterns.

We argue that a previously unexamined factor— beliefs about the malleability of racial bias—guides Whites’ strategies for difficult interracial interactions. We predicted and found that those who believe racial bias is malleable favor learning-oriented strategies such as taking the other person’s perspective and trying to learn why an interaction is challenging, whereas those who believe racial bias is fixed favor performance-oriented strategies such as overcompensating in the interaction and trying to end the interaction as quickly as possible. Four studies support these predictions. Whether measured (Studies 1, 3, and 4) or manipulated (Study 2), beliefs that racial bias is fixed versus malleable yielded these divergent strategies for difficult interracial interactions. Furthermore, beliefs about the malleability of racial bias are distinct from related constructs (e.g., prejudice and motivations to respond without prejudice; Studies 1, 3, and 4) and influence self-reported (Studies 1–3) and actual (Study 4) strategies in imagined (Studies 1–2) and real (Studies 3–4) interracial interactions.

START,START,2111275601,the emergence of autobiographical memory a social cultural developmental theory,2004,"katherine nelson, robyn fivush",psychological review,1,930,203,"The authors present a multicomponent dynamic developmental theory of human autobiographical memory that emerges gradually across the preschool years. The components that contribute to the process of emergence include basic memory abilities, language and narrative, adult memory talk, temporal understanding, and understanding of self and others. The authors review the empirical developmental evidence within each of these components to show how each contributes to the timing, quantity, and quality of personal memories from the early years of life. The authors then consider the relevance of the theory to explanations of childhood amnesia and how the theory accounts for and predicts the complex findings on adults’ earliest memories, including individual, gender, and cultural differences. In probing my childhood (which is the next best thing to probing one’s eternity) I see the awakening of consciousness as a series of spaced flashes, with the intervals between them gradually diminishing until bright blocks of perception are formed, affording memory a slippery hold. (Nabokov, 1951/1989, pp. 20 –21) The theory of autobiographical memory proposed here is that of a functionally new human memory system, one that emerges gradually across the preschool years in the context of developments in language, memory, and self, supplementing the memory systems of early life. Significant individual and gender differences and cultural variations characterize autobiographical memory in both early development and adulthood. The proposed theory accounts for such variation in terms of a multicomponent dynamic developmental system that yields multiple pathways toward converging but also differing endpoints (Fischer, 2000; Gottlieb, 1997; Oyama, 1985; van Geert, 1998). Autobiographical memoryis defined here as an explicit memory of an event that occurred in a specific time and place in one’s personal past (a detailed discussion of the definition follows). The components that contribute to the emergence of autobiographical memory include basic memory systems, the acquisition of complex spoken or signed language, narrative comprehension and production, memory talk with parents and others, style of parent talk, temporal understanding, representation of self, person perspective, and psychological understanding (i.e., theory of mind). Our ultimate goal is to explain universals of process, developmental change, and differences in the pathways toward and ultimate characteristics of mature autobiographical memory. Toward this end, we need to understand the ways in which these components interact within particular cultural milieus and in particular contexts of social interchange. In the first section, we clarify basic concepts of the theory, including emergence, developmental systems, and the central concept of autobiographical memory—what it is and is not in terms of general memory systems theories. Next we present the basic assumptions and claims of the social cultural developmental theory. Following an explication of the theory, we review each of the components proposed to contribute to the emergence of autobiographical memory. After presenting the developmental evidence, we consider the relevance of the theory to explanations of childhood amnesia and detail how the theory accounts for and predicts the complex findings on adults’ earliest memories, including individual, gender, and cultural differences. In the end, we consider the functions of autobiographical memory in human and cultural development in relation to the theory proposed."

Seven experiments revealed that participants can distinguish tasks that entail high-level versus low-level construal. Further, participants recognized the usefulness of preparatory exercises with which to instantiate high-level versus low-level construal for task performance, and this knowledge predicted behavioral choices.

Evidence for a deficit in an executive motor inhibition process for the ADHD combined type is more compelling but is not equally strong for all forms of executive inhibitory control.

Conversion of symbol to sound and visa versa, then clubbing them together to form a coherent whole is a complicated cognitive process which lays the foundation for one of the two main components (decoding) of reading. The decoding process precedes the higher level mechanism like comprehension. Further, the decoding process comprises of two factors: Phonological Awareness (PA) and Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN). They are known to predict reading ability in children. Poor PA had been accepted as the cause of reading disability. Later, some studies showed that some children even with average or good PA also failed to pickup reading. Denckla and Rudel (1972, 1974, 1976) showed that Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) also predicted reading ability. According to the theory of double deficit hypothesis (DDH) proposed by Bowers and Wolf (1993), children with reading disability can be characterized as those with Phonological deficits only, those with naming deficits only and those with deficits in both the domains (in Siddaiah and Padakannaya, 2014). Many researchers have agreed PA and RAN are good predictors of RD.The ability to process stimuli rapidly, to automatize this process and to recognize words makes indispensible contribution to the act of reading (Norton and Wolf, 2012). Accurate and rapid retrieval of stimulus like letters and words are essential and deficiency in this process hinders reading. Even though some readers may posses good decoding skills they may have deficits in RAN leading to difficulties in reading familiar high frequency words. The presence of naming speed deficit in children with reading disability irrespective of languages in which children learn to read which may vary in orthographic consistency (Siddaiah and Padakannaya, 2014). Norton and Wolf, 2012, have studied the phenomena in a different perspective in which RAN is conceptualized as a mini-circuit of the later-developing reading circuitry.Dunckla and Rudel (1976, pp. 471-479) clearly pointed out that those who were slow in naming colors were not necessarily less intelligent than those who were fast. Speed of naming varies according the material presented for naming and not intelligence. Many dyslexic children were slow in color naming time but not their naming time for picture and objects. Many studies have established the fact that many dyslexics had higher scores on intelligence measure and slower RAN compared to non- dyslexics. Here, we see that naming time and its connection to successive processing. There is ample evidence to show that successive processing is generally associated with reading disability. Successive processing is clearly measured through serial word recall, one of the tests in Cognitive Assessment System (CAS), and it is also involved in naming time, (Das, Mok & Mishra, 1993).The study of reading within the framework of information processing models of cognition are helpful in comprehending the psychological mechanism by which the differences between the good and poor readers on several measures come about (Dash & Dash, 2011). Based on their PASS (Planning, Attention, Simultaneous and Successive) theory, Nagieri and Das (1997), created the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) a cognitive assessment battery designed to evaluate cognitive processing in children of 5 to 17 years of age. Evidence is also available that simultaneous, successive as well as planning processes have correlated significantly with reading-decoding and readingcomprehension (Dash & Dash, 1999). Nishanimut and Padakannaya (2014) (in press), in their study concluded that there is a significant weakness in cognitive processing with respect to PASS components among participants with reading disability, compared to children without reading disability in Kannada. Their results suggest that children with reading disability in Kannada are weaker in simultaneous processing, which validates earlier findings in other Asian languages studies (Wang, Georgiou & Das, Qing, 2012). …"

Evaluations of a rape complainant's credibility often determine whether a case progresses through the criminal justice system. Even though emotional demeanor is not related to witness honesty or accuracy, distressed rape complainants are perceived to be more credible than complainants who present with controlled affect. To understand the extent and robustness of the influence of emotional demeanor on credibility judgments of female adult rape complainants, we conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and p-curve analysis of the experimental simulated decision-making literature on the influence of complainant emotional demeanor on complainant credibility. The meta-analysis included 20 studies with participants who were criminal justice professionals (e.g., police officers and judges), community members, and mock jurors (N = 3128). Results suggest that distressed demeanor significantly increased perceptions of complainant credibility, with a small to moderate effect size estimate. Importantly, the results of p-curve analysis suggest that reporting bias is not a likely explanation for the effect of emotional demeanor on rape complainant credibility. Sample type (whether perceivers were criminal justice professionals or prospective jurors) and stimulus modality (whether perceivers read about or watched the complainant recount the alleged rape) were not found to moderate the effect size estimate. These results suggest that effective methods of reducing reliance on emotional demeanor to make credibility judgments about rape complainants should be investigated to make credibility assessments fairer and more accurate."

Inspired by the recent finding that fractal scaling of exploratory movements predicts how well the movements sample available perceptual information, we investigate the possibility that dexterity of craftsmen would be characterized by fractal (long-range) temporal correlation properties of fluctuations in their movement wielding a tool. A reanalysis of hammering behavior involved in stone beads production in India (Nonaka & Bril, 2012) revealed the presence of long-range, power-law correlations, as part of multiplicative cascades operating over a wide range of time scales. In the unfamiliar condition using unusual material, the wielding behavior of highly skilled experts displayed a significant increase of long-range temporal correlations, whereas that of less experts exhibited a significant loss of long-range correlations and reduced heterogeneity of scaling properties over time, which robustly discriminated the groups with different skill levels. Alterations in long-range correlation properties of movement fluctuations are apparently associated with changes in the situation differently depending on the level of expertise."

Problems with the mapping process nevertheless occur in about 5% of the population and are typically attributed to poor phonological representations, which are – in turn – attributed to underlying speech processing difficulties. We examined auditory discrimination of speech sounds in 6-year-old beginning readers with a familial risk of dyslexia (n=31) and no such risk (n=30) using the mismatch negativity (MMN). MMNs were recorded for stimuli belonging to either the same phoneme category (acoustic variants of /bə/) or different phoneme categories (/bə/ vs. /də/). Stimuli from different phoneme categories elicited MMNs in both the control and at-risk children, but the MMN amplitude was clearly lower in the at-risk children. In contrast, the stimuli from the same phoneme category elicited an MMN in only the children at risk for dyslexia. These results show children at risk for dyslexia to be sensitive to acoustic properties that are irrelevant in their language. Our findings thus suggest a possible cause of dyslexia in that they show 6-year-old beginning readers with at least one parent diagnosed with dyslexia to have a neural sensitivity to speech contrasts that are irrelevant in the ambient language. This sensitivity clearly hampers the development of stable phonological representations and thus leads to significant reading impairment later in life."

A growing body of research also suggests that individuals with dyslexia have problems with categorical perception, as evidenced by weaker discrimination of between-category differences and better discrimination of within-category differences compared to average readers. Whether the categorical perception problems of individuals with dyslexia are a result of their reading problems or a cause has yet to be determined. Whether the observed perception deficit relates to a more general auditory deficit or is specific to speech also has yet to be determined. To shed more light on these issues, the categorical perception abilities of children at risk for dyslexia and chronological age controls were investigated before and after the onset of formal reading instruction in a longitudinal study. Both identification and discrimination data were collected using identical paradigms for speech and non-speech stimuli. Results showed the children at risk for dyslexia to shift from an allophonic mode of perception in kindergarten to a phonemic mode of perception in first grade, while the control group showed a phonemic mode already in kindergarten. The children at risk for dyslexia thus showed an allophonic perception deficit in kindergarten, which was later suppressed by phonemic perception as a result of formal reading instruction in first grade; allophonic perception in kindergarten can thus be treated as a clinical marker for the possibility of later reading problems."

This algorithm was incorporated into the Bayesian Reader model (D. Norris, 2006), and its predictions were confirmed in 3 experiments. The experiments showed that the pattern of masked priming is not a fixed function of the relations between the prime and the target but can be changed radically by changing the task from lexical decision to a same-different judgment.

However, in modern, industrialized societies, the strain presented by dramatic rises in population aging potentially threatens traditional cultural expectations. Addressing these competing hypotheses, a literature search located 37 eligible papers, comprising samples from 23 countries and 21,093 total participants, directly comparing Easterners and Westerners (as classified per U.N. conventions) in their attitudes toward aging and the aged. Contradicting conventional wisdom, a random-effects meta-analysis on these articles found such evaluations to be more negative in the East overall (standardized mean difference 0.31). High heterogeneity in study comparisons suggested the presence of moderators; indeed, geographical region emerged as a significant moderating factor, with the strongest levels of senior derogation emerging in East Asia (compared with South and Southeast Asia) and non-Anglophone Europe (compared with North American and Anglophone Western regions). At the country level, multiple-moderator meta-regression analysis confirmed recent rises in population aging to significantly predict negative elder attitudes, controlling for industrialization per se over the same time period. Unexpectedly, these analyses also found that cultural individualism significantly predicted relative positivity—suggesting that, for generating elder respect within rapidly aging societies, collectivist traditions may backfire. The findings suggest the importance of demographic challenges in shaping modern attitudes toward elders—presenting considerations for future research in ageism, cross-cultural psychology, and even economic development, as societies across the globe accommodate unprecedented numbers of older citizens."

Mounting evidence suggests that walking may help to maintain physical and cognitive independence in old age by preventing a variety of health problems. However, older Americans fall far short of meeting the daily recommendations for walking. In 2 studies, we examined whether considering older adults' preferential attention to positive information may effectively enhance interventions aimed at promoting walking. In Study 1, we compared the effectiveness of positive, negative, and neutral messages to encourage walking (as measured with pedometers). Older adults who were informed about the benefits of walking walked more than those who were informed about the negative consequences of failing to walk, whereas younger adults were unaffected by framing valence. In Study 2, we examined within-person change in walking in older adults in response to positively- or negatively-framed messages over a 28-day period. Once again, positively-framed messages more effectively promoted walking than negatively-framed messages, and the effect was sustained across the intervention period. Together, these studies suggest that consideration of age-related changes in preferences for positive and negative information may inform the design of effective interventions to promote healthy lifestyles. Future research is needed to examine the mechanisms underlying the greater effectiveness of positively- as opposed to negatively-framed messages and the generalizability of findings to other intervention targets and other subpopulations of older adults.

START,START,1993445163,cognitive constraints on ordering operations the case of geometric analogies,1987,"laura r novick, barbara tversky",journal of experimental psychology general,1,30,41,"SUMMARY Many tasks (e.g., solving algebraic equations and running errands) require the execution of several component processes in an unconstrained order. The research reported here uses the geometric analogy task as a paradigm case for studying the ordering of component processes in this type of task. In solving geometric analogies by applying mental transformations such as rotate, change size, and add a pan, the order of performing the transformations is unconstrained and does not in principle affect solution accuracy. Nevertheless, solvers may bring cognitive constraints with them to the analogy task that influence the ordering of the transformations. First, we demonstrate that solvers have a preferred order for performing mental transformations during analogy solution. We then investigate three classes of explanations for the preferred order, one based on general information processing considerations, another based on task-specific considerations, and a third based on individual differences in analogy ability. In the first and third experiments, college students solved geometric analogies requiring two or three transformations and indicated the order in which they performed the transformations. There was close agreement on nearly the same order for both types of analogies. In the second experiment, subjects were directed to perform pairs of transformations in the preferred or unpreierred order. Both speed and accuracy were greater for the preferred orders, thus validating subjects' reported orders. Ability differences were observed for only the more difficult three-transformation problems: High- and middle-ability subjects agreed on an overall performance order, but the highs were more consistent in their use of this order. Low-ability subjects did not consistently order the transformations for these difficult problems. The general information processing factor examined was working-memory toad. A number of task factors have been shown to affect working-memory load during the solution of inductive reasoning problems. Of these, we chose to examine process difficulty. Because analogies are solved in working memory, performing more difficult transformations earlier may reduce working-memory load and facilitate problem solution. However, the observed performance order was not correlated with transformation difficulty. The first task-specific factor considered was that some transformations may be identified earlier, possibly because of perceptual salience, and that the performance order follows the identification order. Howcvet; the order of transformation identification also did not account for the order of transformation application in either experiment. Solving geometric analogies is an imagery task in which the solution is constructed mentally by performing the inferred transformations on the given figure. Performance on geometric analogy tests is moderately to highly correlated with a variety of spatial visualization tests that involve image generation, transformation, and retention. The second task-specific factor considered was that the order of transformation application would resemble the order of using the corresponding information in an analogous physical task, the planning and execution of a drawing. Thus, in the fourth experiment, subjects were asked to indicate the order in which they would need specific types of information, each corresponding to a transformation, in order to draw a simple picture. This drawing order paralleled the order of performing mental transformations during analogy solution. Perceptual processing during object identification is also shown to proceed in a similar order These results suggest that in solving geometric analogies, subjects tap into procedures and constraints common to the domains of imagery, drawing, and object"

The model assumes a press for integration that promotes internally generated dynamics and enables the self-structure to operate as a self-organizing dynamical system. When this press is set at high values, the self can resist inconsistent information and reestablish equilibrium after being perturbed by such information. A weak press for integration, on the other hand, impairs self-organization tendencies, making the system vulnerable to external information. Paradoxically, external information of a random nature may enhance the emergence of a stable self-structure in an initially disordered system. The simulation results suggest that important global properties of the self reflect the operation of integration processes that are generic in complex systems."

Participants responded to laterally presented targets preceded by simultaneously presented gaze and arrow cues. Participants' attention was allocated to either of the cues and the other cue served as a distractor. In Experiments 1―4 nonpredictive cues were employed. The validity of the attended cue and distractor were varied orthogonally. Valid cues and distractors produced additive facilitation to reaction times when compared to invalid cues and distractors. The effects of gaze and arrow distractors were similar. When the cue was 100% valid and the distractor 50% valid (Experiment 5), distractor validity had no effect on reaction times. When realistic gaze and arrow cues were employed (Experiment 6), arrow but not gaze distractors influenced the reaction times. The results suggest that social and symbolic directional information can be integrated for attention orienting. The processing of social and symbolic directional information can be modulated by top-down control, but the efficiency of the control depends on the visual saliency of the cues."

In a longitudinal study with a large sample in the United Kingdom, we tested through multiple regressions the contributions that these different units make to the prediction of reading competence (reading comprehension and fluency). The predictors were measured when the children were aged 8-9 years. Reading comprehension and rate were measured concurrently, and reading list fluency was measured at 12 and 13 years. After controlling for age and verbal IQ, the children's use of larger graphophonic units and their use of morphemes in reading and spelling made independent contributions to predicting their reading comprehension and reading fluency. The use of morphemes was the stronger predictor in all analyses. Thus, teaching that promotes the development of these different ways of reading and spelling words should be included in policy and practice."

Later these generalizations are confined to the right grammatical category (e.g., keped for kept) and finally to the right group of words (regular verbs). The authors conclude that children first see these spelling patterns merely as exceptions to the phonetic system and later grasp their grammatical significance.

The current study was the first to use a co-twin control design to disentangle these types of selection factors from socialization effects. Participants included 610 female twins (ages 8–14) drawn from the Michigan State University Twin Registry. To comprehensively examine a range of eating pathology, several disordered eating attitudes and behaviors (e.g., body dissatisfaction, binge eating) were examined via self-report questionnaires. Questionnaires also were used to assess peer group emphasis on body weight and shape. Replicating previous results, significant individual-level associations were found between membership in weight conscious peer groups and disordered eating. However, co-twin control analyses indicated that these associations were largely due to genetic and/or shared environmental selection factors rather than pure socialization effects. Importantly, results remained unchanged when controlling for pubertal status, suggesting that effects do not vary across developmental stage. Overall, these findings question whether associations between weight conscious peer groups and disordered eating are due entirely to socialization processes. Future studies are needed to identify the specific genetic and/or shared environmental factors that may drive selection into weight conscious peer groups."

When such phenomenon of diminishing accuracy occurs among cowitnesses, it is termed memory conformity or the social contagion effect. The present study set out to provide a rigorous test of the underlying mechanisms with particular emphasis on investigating whether genuine false memory is involved. To this end, we conducted an earwitness experiment in which some participants were exposed to discrepant cowitness information and provided their recollections repeatedly and under different conditions. Additionally, we examined the impact of cowitness intimacy by using a random assignment procedure, an aspect that has not been previously studied. With regard to the underlying processes, our findings clearly argue that informational rather than normative influence plays a dominant role. Moreover, highly accurate source attributions indicated that participants were aware of drawing on the recollection of their counterparts. Consequently, we did not obtain any evidence for false memory. With regard to cowitness intimacy, the results were inconsistent and call for further research.Keywords: memory conformity, misinformation effect, social contagion, source memory, witness memoryEyewitness evidence still poses a dilemma. On the one hand, it constitutes an important contribution to criminal investigation (Wells, Memon, & Penrod, 2006). On the other hand, a large body of literature has revealed that memory reports reflect a fallible and malleable source of information (for a review see Steffens & Mecklenbrauker, 2007). One particularly important aspect within this context regards the presentation of postevent information. That is, after having witnessed an event, people may be exposed to the recollections of other witnesses, media reports or questions of police officers that contain information referring to the incident. This information may be inconsistent with one's own recollections, in that it contains additional or even contradictory details. For almost four decades now, researchers have addressed this issue and investigated the impact of discrepant postevent information on witness accounts (Loftus, Miller, & Burns, 1978). The typical finding is that participants are less likely to report the original information when misleading postevent information has been presented, compared with a control condition that included instead no information, neutral information or information consistent with the original (e.g.. Belli, Windshitl, McCarthy, & Winfrey, 1992; Intraub & Hoffmann, 1992; Payne, Toglia, & Anastasi, 1994).Research regarding this misinformation effect (Loftus, 1979) mostly involved the presentation of postevent information that was embedded in ""nonsocial"" sources such as narratives (e.g., Wright & Stround. 1998). More recently, some studies have investigated the influence of postevent information that had been introduced by a real person such as a confederate (e.g., Allan & Gabbert, 2008; Schneider & Watkins, 1996) or another participant (e.g., Gabbert, Memon, & Allan, 2003; Garry, French, Kinzett, & Mori, 2008; Meade & Roediger, 2002; Mori & Mori, 2008; Wright & Schwartz., 2010; Wright, Self, & Justice, 2000). The relevance of this approach has become even more evident since Paterson and Kemp (2006) conducted a survey among witnesses and found that 86% of them had discussed their memories with another witness before talking to the police (see Skagerberg & Wright, 2008 for a smaller, but nevertheless substantial and relevant percentage: 58%). The detrimental effect on witnesses' memory of inconsistent postevent information from other people has been documented as well and has been termed social contagion (Meade & Roediger, 2002) or memory conformity (Wright, Memon, Skagerberg, & Gabbert, 2009). Two papers that compared cowitnesses and narratives as sources for inconsistent information the effects were stronger for cowitnesses (Gabbert, Memon, Allan, & Wright, 2004; Paterson & Kemp, 2006). …"

To the contrary, when people only fantasize about a desired future or only reflect on present reality, expectancy-independent moderate goal commitment emerges. Four experiments pertaining to various life domains supported these hypotheses. Strength of goal commitment was assessed in cognitive (e.g., making plans), affective (e.g., felt attachment), and behavioral terms (e.g., effort expenditure, quality of performance).

It has been demonstrated that the communicative gestures of one agent may be effectively used to predict the actions of other agents. Individuals with schizophrenia often present social-cognitive deficits. The aim of this paper is to examine interpersonal predictive coding in patients with schizophrenia. Forty-six participants with schizophrenia and 40 healthy controls (HC) completed a simultaneous masking detection task (Interpersonal Detection Task; IDT), during which they observed point-light displays of two agents (A and B). During the communicative condition, agent A performed a communicative gesture, to which agent B responded accordingly. During the individual condition, agent A performed a noncommunicative action instead of the communicative gesture. Upon completion of the IDT, participants were asked to explicitly classify the actions of two agents based on nonmasked videos of point-light dyads. In line with previous findings, people with schizophrenia presented a reduced masking threshold for biological motion displays, and were less able to correctly recognize the actions of two agents during the explicit recognition task. However, observing the communicative gesture of agent A enhanced the visual discrimination of agent B in participants from all groups. This effect was observed despite the fact that SCZ presented overall diminished sensitivity to biological motion during IDT. Interpersonal predictive coding, which at least partially relies upon implicit processes, may be less impaired in people with schizophrenia than explicit social-cognitive processes (e.g., theory of mind).

However, a question that has not been addressed by previous research is the integration of contingencies of those actions (e.g., perceivers’ ultimate goals) that are typically learned over time into the initial spontaneous impressions of those others. Three experiments examined updating of spontaneously formed trait inferences (STIs) and evaluative inferences (SEIs) as a function of the contingency information that alters the meaning of the initial information. All three studies showed that perceivers update their SEIs (both positive and negative) immediately after learning about the contingencies (i.e., transforming information). STIs, however, were not updated, even when the contingency information was provided immediately after the initial behavior information (Experiment 3). Instead, in all three experiments participants formed multiple STIs; one from the behavior information before and one from the information after the contingency. It was only when participants had the opportunity to elaborate on their trait judgments within explicit measures that they revised their judgments and aligned them with the contingency information. The results and the implications of the findings are discussed in light of the theoretical models suggesting separate mechanisms of semantic and evaluative processing in person perception.

However, little attention has been paid to inductively deriving insights about what constitutes health-related masculine values among young men. A sequential exploratory mixed-methods design, comprising α qualitative lead to derive health-related masculine values with α follow-up quantitative arm to test the items, was used. Drawing on α sample of 15–29-year-old Canadian male interview participants (n = 30) and survey respondents (n = 600), 5 health-related masculine values were highlighted: (a) selflessness, (b) openness, (c) well-being, (d) strength, and (e) autonomy. Selflessness was characterized by caring for and helping others. Openness included the willingness to gain exposure from new experiences, ideas, and people. Well-being was linked to fitness and masculine body ideals and aesthetics. In terms of strength, men endorsed intellectual, emotional, and physical strength. Regarding autonomy, there was consensus men should be self-sufficient and decisive, whereas being independent drew less endorsement. Highlighting the interdependency of these domains, exploratory factor analysis yielded 2 overarching reliable quantitative dimensions characterized by domains of being inclusive (openness and selflessness; NA = .88) and empowered (well-being and autonomy; NA = .85). Some inductively derived and pilot-tested values ran counter to long-standing claims that young men are typically hedonistic, hypercompetitive, and estranged from self-health. Study findings are discussed detailing how the evaluation of specific health-related masculine values in subgroups of men might advance masculinities-focused men’s health research and inform the next generation of targeted gender-sensitized services.

It also examined whether Grade 4 students (18 boys, 14 girls) possessed more discourse knowledge than Grade 2 students (18 boys, 14 girls). Students wrote a story and responded to a series of questions designed to elicit their declarative and procedural knowledge about the characteristics of good writing in general and stories in particular as well as their knowledge about how to write. Five aspects of this discourse knowledge (substantive, production, motivation, story elements, and irrelevant) together made a unique and significant contribution to the prediction of story quality, length, and vocabulary diversity beyond the 7 control variables. In addition, older students possessed greater knowledge about the role of substantive processes, motivation, and abilities in writing. Findings support the theoretical propositions that discourse knowledge is an important element in early writing development and that such knowledge is an integral part of the knowledge-telling approach to writing."

One hundred Spanish pre-reading children were evaluated on their MEP, naming speed (RAN), phonemic awareness (PA), letter knowledge (LK) and IQ. Early reading level was measured in first grade. In third grade, four reading lists consisting of short and long, high- and low-frequency words were administered. Results from path analyses revealed that, after controlling for RAN, PA, LK, IQ and early reading level, MEP was a significant predictor of the reading of long low-frequency words only. This result suggests that, in the transparent Spanish orthography, pre-reading MEP is significantly linked to future decoding skill.

Non-sensory factors such as increased arousal and attention have been thought to mediate this flicker-based temporal-dilation aftereffect. Here we provide evidence that adaptation of low-level cortical visual neurons contributes to this aftereffect. The aftereffect was significantly reduced by a 45° change in Gabor orientation between adaptation and test. Because orientation-tuning bandwidths are smaller in lower-level cortical visual areas and are approximately 45° in human V1, the result suggests that flicker adaptation of orientation-tuned V1 neurons contributes to the temporal-dilation aftereffect. The aftereffect was abolished when the adaptor and test stimuli were presented to different eyes. Because eye preferences are strong in V1 but diminish in higher-level visual areas, the eye specificity of the aftereffect corroborates the involvement of low-level cortical visual neurons. Our results thus suggest that flicker adaptation of low-level cortical visual neurons contributes to expanding visual duration. Furthermore, this temporal-dilation aftereffect dissociates from the previously reported temporal-constriction aftereffect on the basis of the differences in their orientation and flicker-frequency selectivity, suggesting that the visual system possesses at least two distinct and potentially complementary mechanisms for adaptively coding perceived duration."

A polemic research issue in this area has been the nature of the perception deficit. Another issue is the causal role of this deficit in dyslexia. Most studies have been carried out in adult and child literates; consequently, the observed deficits may be the result rather than the cause of dyslexia. This study addresses these issues by examining visual and auditory perception in children at risk for dyslexia. We compared children from preschool with and without risk for dyslexia in auditory and visual temporal order judgment tasks and same–different discrimination tasks. Identical visual and auditory, linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli were presented in both tasks. The results revealed that the visual as well as the auditory perception of children at risk for dyslexia is impaired. The comparison between groups in auditory and visual perception shows that the achievement of children at risk was lower than children without risk for dyslexia in the temporal tasks. There were no differences between groups in auditory discrimination tasks. The difficulties of children at risk in visual and auditory perceptive processing affected both linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli. Our conclusions are that children at risk for dyslexia show auditory and visual perceptive deficits for linguistic and nonlinguistic stimuli. The auditory impairment may be explained by temporal processing problems and these problems are more serious for processing language than for processing other auditory stimuli. These visual and auditory perceptive deficits are not the consequence of failing to learn to read, thus, these findings support the theory of temporal processing deficit."

Undergraduate students (N = 112) were tested for vocabulary, nonverbal cognitive ability, exposure to general print, exposure to popularized scientific literature, and the ability to comprehend texts distinguished by the number of inferences that must be generated to support comprehension. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that a combined measure of exposure to general and scientific literature was a significant predictor of syllogistic reasoning ability.

METHODS: The Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT), an emotion labeling task, an emotion intensity rating task, and an observational measure of social disinhibition were completed by 23 individuals with severe TBI. The disinhibition domain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and the interpersonal relationships subscale of the Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (SPRS-IR) were completed by a close other. Fifteen control participants provided norms against which to assess performance on the emotion intensity rating task. RESULTS: BSIT scores predicted informant-reported change in interpersonal relationships on the SPRS-IR. Hyposmia, though, was not associated with informant-reported or observed social disinhibition. An impairment in accuracy scores on both emotion perceptions tasks was found for participants with TBI, yet intensity ratings did not differ between groups. This suggests that people with TBI are not actually impaired at detecting intensity of emotion but are less likely to perceive the target emotion as the dominant emotion. Emotion perception was not related to disinhibition or change in interpersonal relationships. CONCLUSIONS: These results support previous claims that hyposmia has prognostic significance following TBI. On the other hand, emotion perception impairment measured by standardized tasks does not appear to be an important factor in interpersonal outcomes. Finally, these results suggest that standardized emotion perception tasks may underestimate the emotion perception capabilities of people with TBI.

Spanish participants were faster responding to past words with the left hand and to future words with the right hand, whereas Hebrew participants showed the opposite pattern.

Hypotheses were based on research concerning fathers, our previous research showing direct grandfather effects, and the literature on modeling, mediation, and surrogate parenting. Major findings from the path analyses were that grandfathers had a direct effect on children and that grandmothers had neither direct nor indirect influence. Results are discussed in terms of the salience of nurturant grandfathers in these families and the unique role they may play in the family. Adolescent mothering is often viewed as a social problem that places teens' children at risk; their cognitive deficits and nonadaptive social functioning have been well documented (Brooks-Gunn & Furstenberg, 1986). Particularly persuasive are the results of a 17-year follow-up of women who had given birth as adolescents. The investigators described the situation of the children as one of ""massive school failure"" (Furstenberg, Brooks-Gunn, & Morgan, 1987, p. 92). To reduce this waste of human potential, we explored the potential beneficial influence that the teen's parents may exert on her baby. Several factors support this approach to fostering the infant's development. First, few of these children are likely to have sustained contact with their biological fathers. Studies have revealed that only 19%—25% of the biological fathers of teens' babies live with them or are highly involved in their care (Vecchiolla & Maza, 1989). It is therefore possible that the baby's grandfather takes on the role of surrogate father in the absence of an alternative father figure in the home. Furthermore, the vast majority of teen mothers reside in the household of relatives, usually their parents, in the first few years after giving birth (Vecchiolla & Maza, 1989), and between 25% and 50% of those families contain two parents (Furstenberg & Crawford, 1978; Radin, Oyserman, & Benn, 1991).

The current study investigated the relationship between nonlinguistic rhythmic processing, phonological abilities, and early literacy abilities in kindergarteners. A distinctive aspect of the current work was the exploration of whether processing of different types of rhythmic patterns is differentially related to kindergarteners’ phonological and reading-related abilities. Specifically, we examined the processing of metrical versus nonmetrical rhythmic patterns, that is, patterns capable of being subdivided into equal temporal intervals or not (Povel & Essens, 1985). This is an important comparison because most music involves metrical sequences, in which rhythm often has an underlying temporal grid of isochronous units. In contrast, nonmetrical sequences are arguably more typical to speech rhythm, which is temporally structured but does not involve an underlying grid of equal temporal units. A rhythm discrimination app with metrical and nonmetrical patterns was administered to 74 kindergarteners in conjunction with cognitive and preliteracy measures. Findings support a relationship among rhythm perception, phonological awareness, and letter-sound knowledge (an essential precursor of reading). A mediation analysis revealed that the association between rhythm perception and letter-sound knowledge is mediated through phonological awareness. Furthermore, metrical perception accounted for unique variance in letter-sound knowledge above all other language and cognitive measures. These results point to a unique role for temporal regularity processing in the association between musical rhythm and literacy in young children."

Participants were 50 Korean American children who spoke English as a dominant language (DL) and were learning to read Korean as a sequential language (SL). Parallel measures in English and Korean assessed PA, RAN and reading skills. The results showed the similarities and differences between the DL and SL acquisition patterns for PA and RAN. While PA skills of the DL were a dominant predictor in SL reading achievement, RAN became important for the children with the higher level of SL reading performance. This cross-sectional study indicates that proficiencies of PA and RAN in the DL are the pathway to reading success in an SL. This suggests that a universal thread exists in learning dual languages, despite dissimilar orthography, phonology and writing systems."

Cross-group partners' prior intergroup contact moderated the relationship between race-based rejection sensitivity and cortisol reactivity. Following the manipulation, participants kept daily diaries of their experiences in an ethnically diverse setting. Implicitly prejudiced participants initiated more intergroup interactions during the diary period after making a cross-group friend. Participants who had made a cross-group friend reported lower anxious mood during the diary period, which compensated for greater anxious mood among participants high in race-based rejection sensitivity.

In the present studies, we investigated the role of experience and learning on the way the social perceiver deals with multiple category dimensions. Specifically, we tested whether learning which of 2 dimensions is the most relevant to the task at hand influences the encoding and retrieval of both task-relevant and irrelevant dimensions. In our studies, participants went through several cycles, each consisting of a study and a test phase. We manipulated the structure of the tests such that participants were probed on only 1 category dimension (age or gender), despite viewing faces of both category dimensions in all study phases. We hypothesized that when participants were repeatedly tested on 1 dimension, they would proactively control their attention toward that specific dimension and away from the nonrelevant dimension. Five studies demonstrated that: (a) participants learned which dimension was test-relevant such that they gradually became faster and more accurate on that dimension; (b) when the gender dimension was test-relevant, participants were faster and more accurate retrieving information concerning the target faces’ gender than age, while the opposite did not happen when the age dimension was test-relevant; and (c) this dominance of the gender dimension is mainly caused by the inhibition of the age dimension.

Thirty one school children participated in the first study in which they were measured on their ability to solve a centrally presented spatial encoding task, as well as their sensitivity to the frequency doubling illusion across the retina. We found that both spatial frequency doubling sensitivity and performance in the spatial encoding task were correlated with reading, however these tasks were unrelated to each other. Furthermore, frequency doubling sensitivity was correlated with contextual reading, but not single-word reading, while the central spatial encoding task was correlated with both reading tasks. These findings may have functional implications for text presentation preference. Accordingly, in Experiment 2 we demonstrated that children with poor FDT sensitivity read more accurately when words were presented singularly rather than in a whole-text format. In conclusion, we suggest that contextual reading may depend upon two separate and functionally distinct visual encoding mechanisms—one central, important for the spatial discrimination of letters within words, and the other, a spotlighting mechanism important for spatial localization within a body of text. While both mechanisms may constrain reading efficiency, neither mechanism enforces an absolute limit on reading ability. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Sign intelligibility was measured for 32 experienced ASL signers who viewed individual signs. For full gray-scale dynamic signs activity-index subsampling yielded sequences that were significantly more intelligible than when every /nth frame was chosen.

However, the relationship between psychoanalytic work in the clinic and psychoanalytic social research poses a series of questions for those working in each domain. The relationship opened up new fields of enquiry, of empirical and theoretical research, but it also now gives rise to empirical and theoretical problems. This paper is concerned with the elaboration of clinical concepts in the emerging field of psychosocial research, with a particular focus on the use of transference. The paper distinguishes 3 versions of transference in the psychoanalytic tradition, drawing attention to the importance of an “intersubjective” conception of transference in psychosocial research as an alternative to “attachment” models that appeal to mainstream empiricist approaches to psychological inquiry. The third version of transference elaborated in Lacanian psychoanalysis, one concerned with signification, is used to ground an analysis of the clinic as specific space in which the phenomenon manifests itself. Analysis of the clinic as “transferential space” enables us to conceptualize the place of psychoanalysis in the clinic and to question the extrapolation of transference to social research. The paper concludes with a consideration of generalized transference outside the clinic."

To address this issue, we present a collection of 4 lexically based studies using the largest-to-date number of situation characteristics to identify the major dimensions of the psychological situation. These studies each implemented a unique sampling and analytic methodology—namely, a qualitative dimensional exploration; the factor analyses of 2, independent samples of large-scale in situ ratings of situations; and the use of lexical-vector representations from neural-network-based models derived from millions of sources of natural-language usage with a total of 146.7 billion words.

Performance was above chance in all test conditions and was similarly high for the line drawings and silhouettes of geons, suggesting the use of the outline shape to recognize the original objects. In addition, transfer for the geons seen under new lighting was greater than for the other stimuli, stressing the importance of the shading information. Experiment 3, using geons filled with new textures, showed that a radical change in the surface cues does not prevent object recognition.

We investigated the cortical sequence of word perception in first-graders (7–8 years old), with special emphasis on occipitotemporal cortex in which, in adults, letter-string-sensitive responses are detected at 150 ms after stimulus. To identify neural activation that is sensitive to either the amount of basic visual features or specifically to letter strings, we recorded whole-head magnetoencephalography responses to words embedded in three different levels of noise and to symbol strings. As was shown previously in adults, activation reflecting stimulus nonspecific visual feature analysis was localized to occipital cortex in children. It was followed by letter-string-sensitive activation in the left occipitotemporal cortex and, subsequently, in the temporal cortex. These processing stages were correlated in timing and activation strength. Compared with adults, however, the timing of activation was clearly delayed in children, and the delay was progressively increased from occipital to occipitotemporal and further to temporal areas. This finding is likely to reflect increasing immaturity of the underlying neural generators when advancing from low-level visual analysis to higher-order areas involved in written word perception. When a salient occipitotemporal letter-string-sensitive activation was detected (10 of 18 children), its strength was correlated with phonological skills, in line with the known relevance of phonological awareness in reading acquisition."

We used whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record neural responses to speech and nonspeech sounds in first-graders (7-8-year-old) and compared the activation sequence to that in adults. In children, the general location of neural activity in the superior temporal cortex was similar to that in adults, but in the time domain the sequence of activation was strikingly different. Cortical differentiation between sound types emerged in a prolonged response pattern at about 250 ms after sound onset, in both hemispheres, clearly later than the corresponding effect at about 100 ms in adults that was detected specifically in the left hemisphere. Better reading skills were linked with shorter-lasting neural activation, speaking for interdependence of the maturing neural processes of auditory perception and developing linguistic skills. This study uniquely utilized the potential of MEG in comparing both spatial and temporal characteristics of neural activation between adults and children.

In addition, this meta-analysis examines potential mechanisms by which perceiving discrimination may affect health, including through psychological and physiological stress responses and health behaviors. Analysis of 134 samples suggests that when weighting each study’s contribution by sample size, perceived discrimination has a significant negative effect on both mental and physical health. Perceived discrimination also produces significantly heightened stress responses and is related to participation in unhealthy and nonparticipation in healthy behaviors. These findings suggest potential pathways linking perceived discrimination to negative health outcomes."

However, evidence on choice effects has not been ubiquitously positive, and recent investigations have revealed factors that diminish or reverse the effects of choosing. This investigation sought to extend this line of inquiry by examining whether interest factors may influence preferences for choosing and the effects of choice on motivation and performance. In Study 1, participants read a series of scenarios and reported a greater preference for choosing aspects of a task when the task was more, compared to less, personally interesting. Similarly, Study 2 revealed that choosing aspects of a trivia game enhanced post-task interest for the game only for individuals high in initial individual interest for trivia games in general. In contrast, Study 3 revealed that choosing enhanced post-task interest, perceived competence, value, and relative liking for a reading comprehension task when the reading passage was boring. When the passage was interesting, choosing resulted in less adaptive motivation outcomes. Going further, exploratory analyses revealed a 3-way interaction, suggesting that choosing enhanced willingness to engage in the task again only for those high in initial individual interest for reading and when the particular version of the task was boring. Interactions between choice and interest were not revealed for task performance in either Study 2 or Study 3. Rather, performance was higher among individuals who chose compared to individuals who did not. Implications of these findings are discussed."

Students were randomly assigned within classrooms either to receive a choice of homework options or to be assigned an option for all homework in one instructional unit. Conditions were reversed for a second instructional unit. Results revealed that when students received a choice of homework they reported higher intrinsic motivation to do homework, felt more competent regarding the homework, and performed better on the unit test compared with when they did not have a choice. In addition, a trend suggested that having choices enhanced homework completion rates compared with when no choices were given. In a second analysis involving the same students, the importance of perceived provision of choice was examined in the context of student perceptions of their teachers’ support for autonomy more broadly defined. Survey data showed that the relationship between perceptions of receiving autonomy support from teachers and intrinsic motivation for schoolwork could be fully accounted for by students’ perceptions of receiving choices from their teachers.

The predictors of individual differences in reading were similar in the 2 languages; phoneme awareness (as measured by accuracy and response time measures) was a significant predictor of reading, whereas rapid naming of colors, animals, and objects was not.

In this study, the authors report evidence for lingering misinterpretations using a paraphrasing methodology, which is less biased than previous methodologies. Using paraphrasing, they found that garden-path sentences are paraphrased according to a partially reanalyzed interpretation. This finding suggests that the arguments put forward by Christianson et al. are correct: Comprehenders’ final interpretations of sentences are often incorrect and do not correspond to the initial input.

This study introduced both a more granular measure of media multitasking and a new comparative measure of media use versus time spent in face-to-face communication. Regression analyses indicated that negative social well-being was positively associated with levels of uses of media that are centrally about interpersonal interaction (e.g., phone, online communication) as well as uses of media that are not (e.g., video, music, and reading). Video use was particularly strongly associated with negative social well-being indicators. Media multitasking was also associated with negative social indicators. Conversely, face-to-face communication was strongly associated with positive social well-being. Cell phone ownership and having a television or computer in one’s room had little direct association with children’s socioemotional well-being.

It was recently advanced that the characteristics of DD in Italian, a language with shallow orthography, are influenced by a positive history for language delay. Objective: We explored this hypothesis by studying in Italian individuals with DD (i) the brain representation of phonological processing with functional magnetic resonance imaging and (ii) the correlation between the patterns of activation and the presence/absence of previous language delay. Method: Thirteen individuals with DD and 13 controls participated in the functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment consisting of a rhyme-generation task. Results: Individuals with DD showed a reduced activation of phonological processing areas of the left hemisphere, such as the middle frontal gyrus, the precuneus, and the inferior parietal lobule, and in particular the superior temporal gyrus. Furthermore, patients with a history of language delay had reduced activation in the left inferior and medial frontal gyrus, that was associated with worse reading and phonological accuracy than patients with normal language development. Conclusions: Neurofunctional profiles of Italian individuals with DD are correlated to the history of language delay, suggesting that the relatively better behavioral profiles observed in individuals without a history of language delay are associated with a major activation of frontal networks normally involved in phonological working memory."

There are 982 effect sizes for the comparison between children with RD and age-matched typically developing (A-TD) children and 152 effect sizes for the comparison between children with RD and reading-level-matched typically developing (R-TD) children on multiple linguistic and cognitive skills. Results showed that compared to A-TD children, children with RD have severe deficits in morphological awareness, orthographic knowledge, phonological awareness, rapid naming, working memory, and visual skills and moderate deficits in short-term memory and motor skills. Compared to R-TD children, children with RD only have moderate deficits in rapid naming and mild deficits in orthographic knowledge. Moderation analyses for the comparison between RD and A-TD children revealed that children with more severe RD show more severe deficits in morphological awareness, phonological awareness, rapid naming, and visual skills. However, neither location (Mainland vs. Hong Kong) nor type of reading screening (character recognition vs. character recognition combined with reading comprehension) emerged as a moderator of the deficit profiles. These findings indicate that Chinese children with RD have deficits on a wide range of cognitive and linguistic skills. Deficits in rapid naming and orthographic knowledge may be potential causal factors for RD in Chinese based on existing evidence. Implications for the diagnosis and instructions of Chinese children with RD were discussed."

Theresults confirmed the findings of previousstudies of a deficit in phoneme awareness indevelopmental dyslexia. At both age levels,dyslexics performed significantly more poorlythan both their CA and RA controls. Althoughdeficits in the other processes investigated,particularly in rapid serial naming, were alsoapparent, they were not as clear-cut as thedeficit in phoneme awareness. In general,definite evidence of a deficit in rapid serialnaming was limited to the more severelyimpaired dyslexics. Furthermore, although rapidserial naming contributed independent variationto various literacy skills, its contributionwas modest relative to the contribution ofphoneme awareness, regardless of whether theliteracy skill relied more or less heavily onphonological or orthographic coding skills. Further analyses suggested that variation inrapid serial skill is particularly importantfor fluent reading of text, whereas phonemeawareness is particularly important for thedevelopment of the ability to read byphonologically recoding letters or groups ofletters in words into their phonological codes.This explains the relatively strongcontribution of phoneme awareness to readingand spelling ability in general. In sum, thephonological hypothesis offers a moreparsimonious account of the present resultsthan the double deficit hypothesis."

Identification was slower for the latter set. In Experiment 1, this was indexed by longer response times in a lexical decision task.

This model builds on the strengths of 2 of the previous models while eliminating their weaknesses. Contrary to the dual-route cascaded model, CDP is able to learn and produce graded consistency effects. Contrary to the triangle and the connectionist dual process models, CDP accounts for serial effects and has more accurate nonword reading performance. CDP also beats all previous models by an order of magnitude when predicting individual item-level variance on large databases.

Overcontrolling parenting, emotion regulation (ER), and inhibitory control (IC) were observed in the laboratory; preadolescent adjustment was teacher-reported and child self-reported. Results from path analysis indicated that overcontrolling parenting at age 2 was associated negatively with ER and IC at age 5, which, in turn, were associated with more child-reported emotional and school problems, fewer teacher-reported social skills, and less teacher-reported academic productivity at age 10. These effects held even when controlling for prior levels of adjustment at age 5, suggesting that ER and IC in early childhood may be associated with increases and decreases in social, emotional, and academic functioning from childhood to preadolescence. Finally, indirect effects from overcontrolling parenting at age 2 to preadolescent outcomes at age 10 were significant, both through IC and ER at age 5. These results support the notion that parenting during toddlerhood is associated with child adjustment into adolescence through its relation with early developing self-regulatory skills."

Two studies investigated whether a dispositional inability to differentiate self from other is manifested at the attentional level as reduced capacity to inhibit following the gaze of another (A. Frischen, A. P. Bayliss, & S. P. Tipper, 2007). Among healthy elderly spouses in Study 1, superior gaze control predicted superior sociocognitive functioning, and those with poorer gaze control abilities were perceived by the partner as constricting the perceiving partner’s autonomy, which in turn predicted lower relationship satisfaction among the latter. Moreover, these links were mediated by enmeshment, as indicated by the percentage of “we”-focused versus “I”- or partner-focused thoughts and emotions in the partners’ independent accounts of the same relationship events. Extending these findings in a sample of Parkinson’s disease patients and their spouses, Study 2 revealed a biphasic effect of self–other differentiation on relationship dynamics: In the early stages of the disease, increased couple focus promoted superior relationship quality, whereas lack of self–other differentiation predicted poorer relationship quality later. Thus, dispositional variations in fundamental social-perceptual processes predict both close relationship dynamics and long-term relationship quality."

To examine elaboration, Experiment 1 included individuals who differed in their need for cognition, and Experiment 2 manipulated the relevance of the message. In each study, Ss were exposed to a persuasive communication following a positive or neutral mood induction. In both studies, positive mood produced more positive attitudes toward the advocacy, but positive mood influenced the positivity of Ss' thoughts only under high-elaboration conditions. Path analyses showed that positive mood had a direct effect on attitudes in the low-elaboration conditions but influenced attitudes indirectly by modifying the positivity of thoughts in the high-elaboration conditions. Does a positive mood facilitate persuasion? Many of the initial studies addressing this question suggested that manipulations inducing a positive mood either just before or during a persuasive communication increased the likelihood of attitude change (e.g., Biggers & Pryor, 1982; Dribben & Brabender, 1979; Srull, 1983).

In this regard, compassion has been described as a prosocial tendency par excellence, fostering helping behavior across a variety of social situations. With the present contribution, we apply a differentiated perspective on compassion. Building on just deserts theory, we argue that when other individuals suffer from unjust actions, compassion for the suffering individuals can foster harmful tendencies toward those who caused the suffering (i.e., third-party punishment). In Studies 1a to 1f, we examined a rich variety of situations in which unjust suffering occurs (i.e., terrorist attacks, sexual assaults, rape of children, and war) and documented a positive relation between compassion for suffering victims and punishment inclinations toward those who caused the suffering. Applying an experimental approach using various paradigms in Studies 2 through 6, compassion was shown to increase third-party punishment. Additional analyses revealed that (a) this increase occurs because compassion intensified moral outrage, which in turn predicted third-party punishment (Studies 2 to 6), and (b) compassion only fosters third-party punishment when suffering was caused by high (vs. low) unjust acts (Study 5). Overall, the present research discusses compassion in a different light in that harmful consequences of compassion are considered. Implications are discussed from a perspective of basic research on compassion and third-party punishment as well as from a societal perspective.

Data on static and dynamic risk factors were collected for 151 patients discharged from Dutch forensic psychiatric hospitals. Community follow-up was prospective, with a 5.5 year minimum. A prediction model was developed using Cox regression analysis. The magnitude of the predictive power of this model was estimated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The final prediction model contained four static and no dynamic predictors. The model’s ROC area under the curve was .79 (95% CI .69‐.89). Clinical risk ratings were non-predictive.

START,START,1989406604,establishing a safe and effective shift schedule,2007,"harper l phillips, peggy m houghton",the behavior analyst today,1,1,0,"The United States Coast Guard has been conducting fatigue studies on its aircrew to establish a shift schedule that enables around-the-clock alert launch capability utilizing a limited number of personnel. In an attempt to get a better understanding of the effects that shift work has on people, their health, their performance, and their families, it is necessary to look at the history of shift work and the circadian cycle. Throughout the remainder of this paper, the term ""shift work"" means working hours that do not fall within the standard definition of a workday, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. History of Shift Work At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, shift work took on a new meaning. Bright artificial lighting made it possible to keep the factory running and extend work hours far past sunset (Hamermesh, 1998). This resulted in many significant changes to the normal work schedule as people wanted to incorporate more leisure into their lives. Instead of working six to seven days a week for shorter periods of time, the weekend became longer and more popular. ""Weekly work hours in the United States dropped sharply during the first 40 years of the 20th century, with a concomitant move away from Sunday, and then Saturday work"" (Hamermesh, 1998, p.323). Shift work is essential in many different industries around the world. Some examples of these include the medical field, industrial manufacturing, law enforcement, fire fighting, customer service, and military operations. Although society has become dependent on shift work, there are many problems, which are caused by its use. Some of the most common problems associated with it are work quality, employee satisfaction, home and family life, and employee health. Disadvantages of Shift Work Performance Research indicates that the greatest number of studies on shift work have been done in the medical field. The frequent long shifts that doctors and nurses are subjected to in hospitals have been a controversial topic for many years. Approximately 60% of nurses work shifts in excess of nine hours (Burke, 2003). To make matters worse, it is common for interns and less experienced nurses to work the longer shifts. Although some hospitals limit the length of work shifts, they often allow their employees to work back-to-back shifts. A study was conducted in Canada to see if a shortened intervention schedule would have an impact on performance. The interns in the study traditionally worked an on-call schedule every third night, with extended shifts up to 28 hours in length (Bernstein & Etchells, 2005). The intervention schedule used shifts less than 24 hours. Over a four-week test period, the interns worked 63 hours per week as opposed to the 79 hours with the traditional schedule. Trained physician observers documented the number of mistakes that were made by the interns. ""The rate of serious medical errors made by interns was 36% higher during the traditional schedule than during the intervention schedule"" (Bernstein & Etchells, 2005, p.474). The decreased efficiency and productivity that results from shift work is substantial. Rajaratnam and Arendt described ""The cost of sleepiness-related accidents can vary substantially, but in general, the estimated total cost of such accidents per year is US$16 billion in the USA, and US$80 billion worldwide"" (2001, p.999). Further studies indicate that truck drivers operating between midnight and 2:00 am are twice as likely to be involved in an accident compared to those driving during the day. Pilots flying at night in a simulator have reduced hand-eye coordination, difficulty completing calculations, and reduced flight performance compared to those flying in the day (U.S. Coast Guard, 2001). Other recent studies have related sleep deprivation to blood alcohol content, BAC. The average person will start to show signs of decreased performance approximately 12 hours after waking up. …"

The current study attempts to resolve some of those methodological concerns by examining brain volume as it relates to components of proposed RD subtypes. We performed individual regression analyses on total cerebral volume, neocortical volume, subcortical volume, 9 neo-cortical structures and 2 sub-cortical structures. These analyses used three dimensions of reading, phonemic ability (PA), orthographic ability, and rapid naming (RN) ability, while accounting for total cerebral volume, age, and performance IQ (PIQ). Primary analyses included membership to a group (poor reader vs. good reader) in the analysis. The result was a significant interaction between PA and reading ability as it predicts total cerebral volume. Analyses revealed that poor readers lacked a relationship between PA and brain size, but that good readers had a significant positive relationship. This pattern of interaction was not present for the other two reading component factors. These findings bring into question the general belief that individuals with RD are at the low end of a reading ability distribution and do not have a unique disorder. Additional analyses revealed only a few significant relationships between brain size and task performance, most notably a positive correlation between orthographic ability and the angular gyrus (AG), as well as a negative correlation between RN ability and the parietal operculum (PO)."

This effect is a cornerstone of modern psycholinguistic models of word production, which assume that it arises in lexical response-selection. However, recent evidence from studies of dual-task performance suggests a locus in perceptual or conceptual processing, prior to lexical response-selection. In these studies, participants manually responded to a tone and named a picture while ignoring a written distractor word. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between tone and picture–word stimulus was manipulated. Semantic interference in naming latencies was present at long tone pre-exposure SOAs, but reduced or absent at short SOAs. Under the prevailing structural or strategic response-selection bottleneck and central capacity sharing models of dual-task performance, the underadditivity of the effects of SOA and stimulus type suggests that semantic interference emerges before lexical response-selection. However, in more recent studies, additive effects of SOA and stimulus type were obtained. Here, we examined the discrepancy in results between these studies in 6 experiments in which we systematically manipulated various dimensions on which these earlier studies differed, including tasks, materials, stimulus types, and SOAs. In all our experiments, additive effects of SOA and stimulus type on naming latencies were obtained. These results strongly suggest that the semantic interference effect arises after perceptual and conceptual processing, during lexical response-selection or later. We discuss several theoretical alternatives with respect to their potential to account for the discrepancy between the present results and other studies showing underadditivity."

Effects of preference were delayed for both types of verbs. The results contrast with findings concerning the processing of nouns (e.g., K. Rayner & S. A. Duffy. 1986). For meaning ambiguities, the authors argue that delays in resolution allow both meanings to reach a high level of activation, thus reducing effects of frequency.

For the full sample of children, no associations between three-generation coresidence and school readiness were found. Analyses by demographic characteristics found that race/ethnicity and nativity moderate the associations; whereas maternal age, relationship status and poverty do not. The findings suggest that three-generation coresidence was associated with lower levels of expressive language for White, Asian and Black children, but more expressive language for Hispanic children. Coresidence was also associated with more externalizing behavior for White and American Indian/Alaskan Native children but less externalizing behavior for Hispanic and Black children. Analyses by maternal nativity found that for children of immigrant mothers, three-generation coresidence was associated with more expressive language and less externalizing and internalizing behavior. Interactions between race/ethnicity and nativity found that the positive associations for Hispanic children were concentrated among children of immigrant parents.

This approach has 2 elements: First, a theoretical view of cognition, called the NewellDennett framework, is described that is particularly favorable to the development of a measurement approach. A class of measurement models, based on Rasch modeling, is described that is particularly favorable to the development of cognitive theories. Knowledge content and access are viewed as determining the observable actions selected by an agent to achieve desired goals in observable situations. To the degree that models within the theory fit the data at hand, one considers measures of observed behavior to be manifestations of intelligent agents having specific classes of knowledge content and varying degrees of access to that knowledge. Although agents, environment, and knowledge are umstitutively defined (in terms of one another), successful application of the theory affords separation of parameters associated with the person from those associated with the environment. Two examples of measurement models developed within the approach are discussed that address the evolution of cognitive skill, strategy choice and application, and developmental changes in mixtures of strategy use. A defining feature of modern-day cognitive psychology is its theoretical admission of mental states and processes. The complexity of observed behavior is assumed to be a manifestation of unobservable mental states and processes interacting with a complex embedding environment. Under a prevalent approach to cognitive psychology, mental states and processes and their resulting behavioral manifestations are shaped by knowledge. For a variety of reasons, one could argue that knowledge ought to be the most scientifically interesting aspect of human psychology. Much, if not most, of the behavioral variability of humans is attributed to knowledge differences arising from different enculturation histories.

Sixty-eight microsatellite markers in regions where linkages had been reported in previous studies were genotyped on 122 children with reading disability and 112 typically reading controls drawn from the same school population. A single allele of marker D6S299 showed a highly significant association with the RD phenotype (D6S299[229], P-value 0.000014). Other markers on other chromosomes also showed suggestive associations. Of particular interest were markers on chromosomes 1 and 15. These two regions have been implicated in studies of populations that formed the founding population in the Afrikaner population. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

At the end of grade 2, the children were assigned three measures of spelling. A series of hierarchical analyses indicated that the three variables (phonological awareness, morphological/syntactic skill and naming speed) at the end of grade 1 were still predictors of spelling performance at the end of grade 2, after variance in the others had been controlled for. The results, which confirm that morphological/syntactic skill and naming-speed skill can predict written language after phonological ability has been controlled for, challenge the unitary phonological theory of written language difficulties."

The emergence of such functional specialization in the human cortex represents a pivotal developmental process, which provides a basis for targeted and efficient information processing. For example, functional specialization to print in the left vOT is an important prerequisite for fluent reading. However, it remains unclear, which processes initiate the preferential cortical activations to characters arising in the vOT during child development. Using a multimodal neuroimaging approach with preschool children at familial risk for developmental dyslexia, we demonstrate how varying levels of expertise modulate the neural response to single characters, which represent the building blocks of print units. The level of expertise to characters was manipulated firstly through brief training of false-font speech–sound associations and secondly by comparing characters for which children differed in their level of familiarity and expertise accumulated through abundant exposure in their everyday environment. Neural correlates of character processing were tracked with simultaneous high-density electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging in a target detection task. We found training performance and expertise-dependent modulation of the visual event-related potential around 220 ms (N1) and the corresponding vOT activation. Additionally, trained false-font characters revealed stronger functional connectivity between the left fusiform gyrus (FFG) seed and left superior parietal/lateral occipital cortex regions with higher training performance. In sum, our results demonstrate that learning artificial-character speech–sound associations enhances activation to trained characters in the vOT and that the magnitude of this activation and the functional connectivity of the left FFG to the parieto-occipital cortex depends on learning performance. This pattern of results suggests emerging development of the reading network after brief training that parallels network specialization during reading acquisition."

Gestalt psychology was probably the most accepted approach, which was at least partly caused by its founding in the neighboring Germany. It was an academic perspective that was convenient for the professional ambitions of its representatives as well as for their endeavor to establish psychology as a serious scientific discipline. On the contrary, the acceptance of behaviorism was rather negative or indifferent. Czech psychologists perceived it as a predominantly foreign, extraneous school of thinking. They preferred the studies on consciousness and the method of introspection over empirical research. Psychoanalysis also has never taken deeper roots in Czechoslovakia. Some Czech intellectuals accepted the existence of unconsciousness but they criticized Freudian sexual symbolism (Peroutka, Capek). Negative attitudes of the politicians Masaryk and Benes also contributed to the cool reception of this school. With sporadic exceptions, the psychoanalytic thinking was developed only in a small Jewish-German-Czech circle."

It has also been demonstrated that word-frequency has little or no effect on word recognition speed when accounting for contextual diversity in isolated word processing tasks. An eye-movement experiment was conducted wherein the effects of word-frequency and contextual diversity were directly contrasted in a normal sentence reading scenario. Subjects read sentences with embedded target words which varied in word frequency and contextual diversity. All first-pass and later reading times were significantly longer for words with lower contextual diversity compared to words with higher contextual diversity when controlling for word-frequency and other important lexical properties. Furthermore, there was no difference in reading times for higher frequency and lower frequency words when controlling for contextual diversity. The results confirm prior findings regarding contextual diversity and word-frequency effects and demonstrate that contextual diversity is a more accurate predictor of word processing speed than word-frequency within a normal reading task."

Two groups of participants (young and older adults) performed discrete Fitts' tasks in which 4 levels of difficulty (ID) were used, resulting from either the manipulation of the size of the target (ID W) or of the distance between home and target positions (ID D). Kinematic analysis allowed distinguishing 4 different types of strategies used to reach the target, on the basis of the existence and the nature of submovements. Results showed that the repertoire of strategies was significantly smaller in older than in young participants. In addition, the frequency of use of the different strategies varied with participants' age. Specifically, the most frequent strategies used by older participants included submovements, while those used by young participants did not include submovements. The differences observed between young and older adults were independent of whether ID was manipulated via target size or movement distance. Finally, age-related differences in strategy performance were found. These results have important implications for furthering our understanding of aging effects in sensorimotor tasks. They also illustrate the usefulness of a strategy approach in a domain where it had never been formally used before."

These experiments investigated the extent to which this integration is dependent on the spatial location of the information remaining constant. Two preview objects were presented in the periphery; Ss fixated that region and named a single target object that appeared in the same spatial location in which one of the two preview objects had been presented. Of primary interest was the facilitative effect when a preview object was identical to the target object as a function of whether they were in the same spatial location. The major finding was that although there was a small effect of switching, there was still a substantial preview benefit even when the location of the identical object switched. In addition, the switching effect did not interact with the level of identity between the preview and target. There was also a preview benefit in conditions in which there were no eye movements and the preview and target objects were at least 5 degrees apart. Thus, the data indicate that the process object identification is relatively insensitive to location information and that object information and location information are coded fairly independently.

Are these meanings represented within the language system (the lexical hypothesis) or are they represented in a general conceptual system that is not restricted to language (the conceptual hypothesis)? To evaluate these hypotheses, sentences were presented in which a pictured object replaced a word (rebus sentences). Previous research has shown that isolated pictures and words are processed equally rapidly in conceptual tasks, but that pictures are markedly slower than words in tasks requiring lexical access. The lexical hypothesis would therefore lead one to expect that rebus sentences will be relatively difficult, whereas the conceptual hypothesis would predict that rebus sentences would be rather easy. Sentences were shown using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) at a rate of 10 or 12 words per second. With one set of materials (Experiments 1 and 2), readers took longer to judge the plausibility of rebus sentences than all-word sentences, although the accuracy of judgment and of recall were similar for the two formats. With two new sets of materials (Experiments 3 and 5), rebus and all-word sentences were virtually equivalent except in one circumstance: when a picture replaced the noun in a familiar phrase such as seedless grapes. In contrast, when the task required overt naming of the rebus picture in a sentence context, latency to name the picture was markedly longer than to name the corresponding word, and the appropriateness of the sentence context affected picture naming but not word naming (Experiment 4). The results fail to support theories that place word meanings in a specialized lexical entry. Instead, the results suggest that the lexical representation of a noun or familiar noun phrase provides a pointer to a nonlinguistic conceptual system, and it is in that system that the meaning of a sentence is constructed. In what part or module of the cognitive system is the seman- tern and yields the sentence's literal meaning; and pragmatic tic information about a noun stored? Is it stored in a lexicon interpretation of this meaning in the general-purpose concepthat is part of a linguistic system, or is the meaning simply a part tual system. of a general-purpose conceptual system?

The contrast on the linguistic system, and for the most part they explicitly can be highlighted by considering two ways in which the mean- or implicitly accept some version of the lexical approach. One ings of words might be put together in sentence processing. Ac- reason is that language-specific lexical representations rather cording to one approach, a word's representation in the lexicon than the underlying concepts are involved in some syntactic provides only a pointer to the relevant concept, and the compo- constraints. For example, Mtidchen is the German word for a sition of word meanings occurs in a general-purpose conceptual young woman, but it is neuter and takes the neuter article system.

START,START,2135872238,word selection in reading sentences preceding versus following contexts,1998,"mary c potter, diana stiefbold, anita moryadas",journal of experimental psychology learning memory and cognition,1,24,59,"A new task, double-word selection, simulated lexical ambiguity by presenting 2 words between which the reader had to choose while reading a sentence shown at 133 or 150 ms/word, following a procedure called rapid serial visual presentation. The double-word pair was presented for less than 100 ms. In immediate recall of the sentence, readers made a correct selection on most trials, both when the relevant context came before the double words and (less accurately) when the relevant context came shortly afterward (Experiments 1 and 2) or with a delay of up to 1 s (Experiment 3). Both words could often be reported if the sentence was stopped one word after the double words (Experiment 2). In Experiment 4, a single function word determined selection between double words differing in syntactic category. The results are consistent with a 2-stage modular interactive model of word perception (M. C. Potter, A. Moryadas, I. Abrams, & A. Noel, 1993) and extend this model to word selection and lexical disambiguation. Although lexical ambiguity is pervasive in both written and spoken English, readers and listeners normally resolve such ambiguity before they become aware of it. Thus, it is apparent that there are powerful and rapidly acting mechanisms available for using context and relative frequency to make a selection among multiple meanings of words. Swinney (1979) claimed that the multiple meanings of a word are activated in parallel when the word is encountered, prior to selection; other theorists (e.g., Forster, 1979) proposed that meanings are activated serially in the order of frequency, with acceptance of the first meaning that fits the context. Mixed models have also been proposed, such as staggered parallel activation on the basis of frequency (e.g., Simpson, 1981) and reordering of access on the basis of prior context (e.g., Duffy, Morris, & Rayner, 1988). Although experimental tests of the various theories have not been conclusive, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that meanings compete in parallel, at least to some extent."

This research investigated whether certain moral concerns contribute to men endorsing feminism. According to the Moral Foundations Theory there are five moral concerns: harm (i.e., the concern for someone’s physical and emotional well-being), fairness (i.e., the concern for equality and justice), ingroup (i.e., the concern for loyalty to group membership), authority (i.e., the concern for tradition and the social hierarchy), and purity (i.e., the concern for physical and spiritual cleanliness; Graham et al.,2011). Graham and colleagues (2009) found that harm and fairness correlate to liberalism; therefore we predicted that men’s feminism would be associated with an increased emphasis on those moral concerns and a decreased emphasis on ingroup, authority, and purity. Using an online survey methodology, participants were assessed on various aspects of feminism and morality. The results generally supported our predictions that higher support for conservative moral concerns correlates to less endorsement of feminism, whereas higher support for liberal moral concerns correlates to more endorsement of feminism, even when controlling for political ideology.

In sum, many elements that potentially supported achievement were identified, including explicit teaching of skills in the context of much reading, writing, and content learning, which is consistent with balanced perspectives on reading and writing development. A major hypothesis in the grounded theory is that even with relatively advantaged populations, great efforts may be required to produce high reading and writing achievement."

The primary data were observations complemented by questionnaire responses and document analyses. Consistent with conclusions in the effective schooling literature, this school has strong leadership, accountability, academic focus, and orderliness. Other aspects of schooling seemed also to support achievement, many consistent with aspects of teaching and learning emphasized in the educational psychology literature. The theory emerging from this study is that the high achievement in this school is caused by multiple factors, including decidedly psychological ones. This article is a portrait of a school, one serving urban, African American students, one with graduates who achieve at high levels. The portrait was composed by researchers steeped in educational psychology and its perspectives, working with the school’s administration to do so. One motivation for this study was to begin to fill a gap that was highlighted by Hilliard and Amankwatia (2003). Their major conclusion was that African American students can excel, with the key ingredient being good teaching. Hilliard and Amankwatia also observed, however, that little is known about the schooling that positively affects African Americans. They called for qualitative studies to document just what goes on in classrooms and schools that are very effective with students who do poorly in traditional classrooms and schools. Such work could be the basis for a theory of effective teaching and schooling that subsequently might be tested in quantitative designs. Thus, in this study, we constructed a case study—intending to produce a theory grounded in data"

Altruistic responding is most salient during heroic acts of helping but is also observed any time one perceives another’s distress or need, which in turn motivates one to help at a current cost to the self. Such aid is simple, observable across species, and rooted in the instincts and circuits that evolved to maximize inclusive fitness through the care of helpless offspring. By design, the system already biases aid to both kin and nonkin under conditions that are largely adaptive. These inherent benefits are also buttressed in primates and humans by known, later-arriving benefits to helping in groupliving animals. Evidence for the proposed homology between altruistic responding and offspring retrieval is presented through 10 key shared factors. Conceptually, both require (a) participation by nonmothers, (b) motor competence and expertise, (c) an adaptive opponency between avoidance and approach, and a facilitating role of (d) neonatal vulnerability, (e) salient distress, and (f) rewarding close contact. Physiologically, they also share neurohormonal support from (g) oxytocin, (h) the domain-general mesolimbocortical system, (i) the cingulate cortex, and (j) the orbitofrontal cortex. The framework intermixes ultimate and proximate levels of analysis and unifies existing views by assuming that even complex human behaviors reflect ancient mammalian neural systems that evolved to solve key problems in adaptive ways, with far-reaching consequences for even our most venerated human traits."

The various variables accounted for only 25–34% of reading comprehension variance, and possible explanations are discussed.

Because Ss were not required to make a lexical decision or naming response, the multiletter units that are revealed by this task arise automatically. It was found that the syllablelike units are not phonological but correspond to orthographic patterns and morphemes. These units affect performance regardless of changes in letter-case, suggesting that the units are based on abstract letter identities. Unit formation was also not affected by visual field of presentation. Several experiments demonstrated that the morphological and orthographic units arise from different processes: The morphological units depend on lexical access, and the orthographic units do not. Finally, the effects of orthography are stronger for good readers than for poor readers. Words are magic. They are magic in the sense that when they are presented with a word or wordlike letter string, a literate subject cannot help but read. The processes involved in word perception are evoked without volition even when it is disadvantageo us to do so (e.g., Stroop, 1935). There is evidence from several different tasks that word identification can take place even when exposure conditions are such that subjects do not believe that they have seen any stimulus at all (Marcel, 1983). The goals of the present research are to characterize the processes and mental representations that are automatically elicited when a subject is presented words or wordlike stimuli, and to begin to generalize these findings to reading outside the laboratory. One attribute of writing systems that may assist in the willy- nilly decoding of printed text is that all alphabetic spelling systems of natural languages exhibit internal structure: The sequence of graphemic elements is not random. This structure has been characterized in many different ways, including letter sequence probabilities (e.g., Massaro, Venezky, & Taylor,"

While sharing similarly designed lexical routes, the two models differ greatly in their respective nonlexical route architecture, such that they often differ on nonword pronunciation. Neither model has been appropriately tested for nonword reading pronunciation accuracy to date. We argue that empirical data on the nonword reading pronunciation of people is the ideal benchmark for testing. Data were gathered from 45 Australian-English-speaking psychology undergraduates reading aloud 412 nonwords. To provide contrast between the models, the nonwords were chosen specifically because DRC and CDP+ disagree on their pronunciation. Both models failed to accurately match the experiment data, and both have deficiencies in nonword reading performance. However, the CDP+ model performed significantly worse than the DRC model. CDP++, the recent successor to CDP+, had improved performance over CDP+, but was also significantly worse than DRC. In addition to highlighting performance shortcomings in each model, the variety of nonword responses given by participants points to a need for models that can account for this variety."

The 1st task revealed comparable NP between all age groups, but a linear decrease in NP through childhood to early adulthood. In the 2nd task, NP decreased linearly into adulthood, with children actually showing larger NP than adults. This Age Group NP interaction was eliminated, however, when reaction time data were log transformed to control for age differences in overall processing speed. When appropriately transformed data were used, both experiments showed that NP was intact and comparable between children, adolescents, and adults, and suggested that an inhibitory process is fully developed by early childhood. The results highlight how potential pitfalls might be avoided when comparing NP in children and adults."

We examined whether visually presented note values produce a SNARC-like effect. Differently from numbers, note values are represented as a decreasing left-to-right progression, allowing us to disambiguate the contribution of order and magnitude in determining the direction of the effect. Musicians with formal education performed a note value comparison in Experiment 1 (direct task), a line orientation judgment in Experiment 2 (indirect task), and a detection task in Experiment 3 (indirect task). When note values were task relevant (direct task), participants responded faster to large note values with the left key-press, and vice versa. Conversely, when note values were task irrelevant (indirect tasks), the direction of this association was reversed. This evidence suggests the existence of separate mechanisms underlying the SNARC effect. Namely, an Order-Related Mechanism (ORM) and a Magnitude-Related Mechanism (MRM) that are revealed by different task demands. Indeed, according to a new model we proposed, ordinal and magnitude related information appears to be preferentially involved in direct and indirect tasks, respectively. (PsycINFO Database Record"

Our study tested the influence of external rhythmic auditory stimulation (i.e., musical rhythm) on syntax processing in children with specific language impairment (SLI; Experiment 1A) and dyslexia (Experiment 1B). METHOD: Children listened to either regular or irregular musical prime sequences followed by blocks of grammatically correct and incorrect sentences. They were required to perform grammaticality judgments for each auditorily presented sentence. Results: Performance of all children (SLI, dyslexia, and controls) in the grammaticality judgments was better after regular prime sequences than after irregular prime sequences, as shown by d' data. The benefit of the regular prime was stronger for SLI children (partial ?2 = .34) than for dyslexic children (partial ?2 = .14), who reached higher performance levels. CONCLUSION: Together with previous findings on deficits in temporal processing and sequencing, as well as with the recent proposition of a temporal sampling (oscillatory) framework for developmental language disorders (U.

Results show that, compared with the standard-grade condition, both high-grade and no-grade conditions enhanced the 2 forms of subsequent intrinsic motivation. However, although task performance explained higher levels of task interest in the high-grade condition, it failed to explain higher levels of continuing motivation for the task. Task autonomy, conversely, explained the higher levels of both task interest and continuing motivation for the task experienced in the nongraded condition.

But what if it’s test answers that students are sharing with their friends? Integrating values, cheating, and in-group bias theory, we hypothesize that adherence to group-loyalty benevolence values—considered as some of the most moral values—positively predicts the acceptance of collective cheating, that is students cheating together with in-group peers, when competition is salient. Operationalizing competition in three different ways we test this in four studies. In Study 1, adherence to benevolence values predicted positive attitudes toward collective but not individual cheating among students presented (vs. not) with a portrayal of society as competitive. Study 2 revealed that, within the competitive context of an end-of-year exam, adherence to benevolence values positively predicted moral disengagement toward collective cheating but negatively predicted individual cheating. Study 3 showed that valuing both being a dependable friend and attaining power and influence, predicted the acceptance of collective cheating. Finally, in Study 4, carried out with dyads of students, groups composed of students who knew each other cheated more than students composed of strangers. Furthermore, dyad adherence to power values positively predicted cheating behavior among dyads that knew (vs. did not know) each other. These results signal that group loyalty can, in certain conditions, lead to justifying and engaging in collective cheating, and that the motivational underpinnings may be the moral status of benevolence values.

Syntactic theories posit that people only draw inferences conforming to the logically valid modus ponens (MP) schema.

Participants read short stories that conformed to either the MP or AC form but without conclusions, and they completed either priming or recognition tasks. Results indicate that both MP and AC inferences occur during discourse processing: MP and AC premise forms prime their respective conclusions, participants erroneously judged that they had read the conclusions to MP and AC arguments, and AC inferences did not stem from a biconditional interpretation of conditionals. Findings support mental models theories."

The global enslavement of children affects countless numbers of victims who are trafficked within their home countries or transported away from their homes and treated as commodities to be bought, sold, and resold for labor or sexual exploitation. All over the world, girls are particularly likely to be trafficked into the sex trade: Girls and women constitute 98% of those who are trafficked for CSE. Health and safety standards in exploitative settings are generally extremely low, and the degree of experienced violence has been linked with adverse physical, psychological, and social-emotional development. The human-rights-based approach to child trafficking provides a comprehensive conceptual framework whereby victim-focused and law enforcement responses can be developed, implemented, and evaluated. This article highlights promising policies and programs designed to prevent child trafficking and CSE by combating demand for sex with children, reducing supply, and strengthening communities. The literature reviewed includes academic publications as well as international and governmental and nongovernmental reports. Implications for social policy and future research are presented.

However, it is unclear whether early neuropsychological functioning predicts later ADHD severity and/or the latter is longitudinally associated with subsequent neuropsychological functioning; and whether these relations are different in children with and without early symptoms of ADHD. This study aimed to examine the longitudinal associations between ADHD severity and neuropsychological functioning among children at high and low risk of developing ADHD. Hyperactive/Inattentive (H/I; N=140) and Typically-developing (TD; N=76) preschoolers (age 3 – 4 years) were recruited (BL) and followed annually for 3 years (F1, F2 and F3). Teachers rated the children’s ADHD severity and impairment using the Behavior Assessment System for Children-2 and the Children’s Problem Checklist, respectively. Parent reports of children’s ADHD severity were obtained using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia – Present and Lifetime version. Neuropsychological functioning was assessed using the NEPSY. In the full sample, there were bi-directional longitudinal associations between neuropsychological functioning and ADHD severity between F1 and F3. Among H/I children, neuropsychological functioning at F1 and F2 predicted ADHD severity at F2 and F3, respectively. In contrast, among TD children the only significant relationship observed was that elevated ADHD symptoms at F2 were associated with poorer neuropsychological functioning at F3. Improved neuropsychological functioning may attenuate ADHD symptoms and associated impairment among H/I children during the early school years. Interventions designed to improve neuropsychological functioning among young H/I children may be beneficial in reducing their ADHD severity."

Phonological processing, orthographic processing, and rapid automatized naming were used as independent variables, each derived from a combination of two scores: phonological awareness and pseudoword repetition, spelling and orthographic choice, and rapid serial naming of letters and digits, respectively. The contribution of these to oral text-reading fluency was evaluated as a direct relationship and via two mediators, decoding accuracy and unitized reading, measured with a single-word oral reading test. The participants were “good” and “poor” readers, i.e., those with reading skills above the 90th and below the 10th percentiles (n = 1344, grades 2–6, St. Petersburg, Russia). In both groups, orthographic processing skills significantly contributed to fluency and unitized reading, but not to decoding accuracy. Phonological processing skills did not contribute directly to reading fluency in either group, while contributing to decoding accuracy and, to a lesser extent, to unitized reading. With respect to the roles of decoding accuracy and unitized reading, the results for good and poor readers diverged: in good readers, unitized reading, but not decoding accuracy, was significantly related to reading fluency. For poor readers, decoding accuracy (measured as pseudoword decoding) was related to reading fluency, but unitized reading was not. These results underscore the importance of orthographic skills for reading fluency even in an orthography with consistent phonology-to-orthography correspondences. They also point to a qualitative difference in the reading strategies of good and poor readers."

This indicates that readers had made reference to lexical information for naming. The result of a second experiment, on the other hand, showed that when an equal number of nonwords are embedded in the stimulus set the word-frequency effect disappears. This indicates that readers had made reference to nonlexical information for naming. These results support the ideas that: (a) the preferred route for naming amongst readers of Turkish script is lexical, regardless of the orthographic-phonological transparency; and (b) the naming process is indeed a flexible one in which task demands may affect the nature of the route used for naming.

This framework, biosocial developmental contextualism, derives from social ecology, developmental systems theory, developmental epidemiology, and developmental neurobiology. This integrative perspective predicts that fragmented, weak efforts in early intervention are not likely to succeed, whereas intensive, high-quality, ecologically pervasive interventions can and do. Relevant evidence is summarized in 6 principles about efficacy of early intervention.

This has led some theorists to argue that these theories represent overlapping psychological processes. If responding to dissonance and uncertainty occurs through a common psychological process, one should expect that the behavioral outcomes of feeling uncertain would also apply to feelings of dissonance, and vice versa. One specific prediction from the meaning maintenance model would be that cognitive dissonance, like other expectancy violations, should lead to the affirmation of unrelated beliefs, or the abstraction of unrelated schemas when the dissonant event cannot be easily accommodated. This article presents 4 studies (N = 1124) demonstrating that the classic induced-compliance dissonance paradigm can lead not only to a change of attitudes (dissonance reduction), but also to (a) an increased reported belief in God (Study 2), (b) a desire to punish norm-violators (Study 1 and 3), (c) a motivation to detect patterns amid noise (Study 3), and (d) polarizing support of public policies among those already biased toward a particular side (Study 4). These results are congruent with theories that propose content-general fluid compensation following the experience of anomaly, a finding not predicted by dissonance theory. The results suggest that dissonance reduction behaviors may share psychological processes described by other theories addressing violations of expectations."

Among researchers, a widely studied learning mechanism is called cross-situational learning (XSL). In XSL, word meanings are learned when learners accumulate statistical information between spoken words and co-occurring objects or events, allowing the learner to overcome referential uncertainty after having sufficient experience with individually ambiguous scenarios. Existing models in this area have mainly assumed that the learner is capable of segmenting words from speech before grounding them to their referential meaning, while segmentation itself has been treated relatively independently of the meaning acquisition. In this article, we argue that XSL is not just a mechanism for word-to-meaning mapping, but that it provides strong cues for proto-lexical word segmentation. If a learner directly solves the correspondence problem between continuous speech input and the contextual referents being talked about, segmentation of the input into word-like units emerges as a by-product of the learning. We present a theoretical model for joint acquisition of proto-lexical segments and their meanings without assuming a priori knowledge of the language. We also investigate the behavior of the model using a computational implementation, making use of transition probability-based statistical learning. Results from simulations show that the model is not only capable of replicating behavioral data on word learning in artificial languages, but also shows effective learning of word segments and their meanings from continuous speech. Moreover, when augmented with a simple familiarity preference during learning, the model shows a good fit to human behavioral data in XSL tasks. These results support the idea of simultaneous segmentation and meaning acquisition and show that comprehensive models of early word segmentation should take referential word meanings into account.

Although researchers agree that DD is characterized by deficient phonological processing (PP), its cause is debated. It has been suggested that altered rapid auditory processing (RAP) may lead to deficient PP in DD and studies have shown deficient RAP in individuals with DD. Functional neuroimaging (fMRI) studies have implicated hypoactivations in left prefrontal brain regions during RAP in individuals with DD. When and how these neuronal alterations evolve remains unknown. In this article, we investigate functional networks during RAP in 28 children with (n = 14) and without (n = 14) a familial risk for DD before reading onset (mean: 5.6 years). Results reveal functional alterations in left-hemispheric prefrontal regions during RAP in prereading children at risk for DD, similar to findings in individuals with DD. Furthermore, activation during RAP in left prefrontal regions positively correlates with prereading measures of PP and with neuronal activation during PP in posterior dorsal and ventral brain areas. Our results suggest that neuronal differences during RAP predate reading instruction and thus are not due to experience-dependent brain changes resulting from DD itself and that there is a functional relationship between neuronal networks for RAP and PP within the prereading brain."

Six studies examine whether underrepresented students’ meta-lay theories influence their sense of belonging to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The studies tested whether underrepresented students who perceive their faculty as believing most students have high scientific aptitude (a universal metatheory) would report a stronger sense of belonging to STEM than those who think their faculty believe that not everyone has high scientific aptitude (a nonuniversal metatheory). Women PhD candidates in STEM fields who held universal rather than nonuniversal metatheories felt greater sense of belonging to their field, both when metatheories were measured (Study 1) and manipulated (Study 2). Undergraduates who held more universal metatheories reported a higher sense of belonging to STEM (Studies 3 and 4) and earned higher final course grades (Study 3). Experimental manipulations depicting a professor communicating the universal lay theory eliminated the difference between African American and European American students’ attraction to a STEM course (Study 5) and between women and men’s sense of belonging to STEM (Study 6). Mini meta-analyses indicated that the universal metatheory increases underrepresented students’ sense of belonging to STEM, reduces the extent of social identity threat they experience, and reduces their perception of faculty as endorsing stereotypes.

Results did not show main effects for sense-making or fluency-building support but an interaction effect, such that a combination of sense-making and fluency-building support is most effective in enhancing fractions knowledge. Causal path analysis of log data from the system shows that sense-making support enhances students’ benefit from fluency-building support, but fluency-building support does not enhance their benefit from sense-making support.

The ambiguous words were either biased (one strongly dominant interpretation) or nonbiased. Readers' gaze durations were longer on nonbiased than biased words when the disambiguating information followed the target word. In Experiment 1, reading times on the disambiguating word did not differ whether the disambiguation followed the target word immediately or occurred several words later. In Experiment 2, prior disambiguation eliminated the long gaze durations on nonbiased target words but resulted in long gaze durations on biased target words if the context demanded the subordinate meaning. The results indicate that successful integration of one meaning with prior context terminates the search for alternative meanings of that word. This results in selective (single meaning) access when integration of a dominant meaning is fast (due to a biasing context) and identification of a subordinate meaning is slow (a strongly biased ambiguity with a low-frequency meaning). Word recognition has been a focus of psycholinguis tic research for some time. Nevertheless, a coherent picture of the processing of lexical ambiguity has appeared only during the past few years. Early studies of ambiguity gave rise to apparently contradictory findings because of a failure to distinguish between different types of ambiguities and an incomplete understanding of the experimental techniques employed. More recently, a great deal has been learned about the processing of lexically ambiguous words from studies exploiting the cross-modal priming technique (Burgess, Tanenhaus, & Seidenberg, 1989; Onifer & Swinney, 1981; Seidenberg, Tanenhaus, Leiman, & Bienkowski, 1982; Swinney, 1979; Tannenhaus, Leiman, & Seidenberg, 1979) in which subjects listen to a sentence containing a lexically ambiguous target word. At some point relative to the target word, a probe word is presented on a screen, and subjects must make a response to the probe (via a lexical decision or naming task). The probe word is either related to one of the two meanings of the ambiguous word or is unrelated to the ambiguous word. A fairly consistent finding has been that the response to probe words related to either meaning of the ambiguous word is facilitated in comparison with an unrelated probe word,"

While most evidence has been negative in English, semantic preview benefit has been observed for readers of Chinese and German. In the present experiment, we investigated whether the discrepancy between English and German may be due to a difference in visual properties of the orthography: the first letter of a noun is always capitalized in German, but is only occasionally capitalized in English. This visually salient property may draw greater attention to the word during parafoveal preview and thus increase preview benefit generally (and lead to a greater opportunity for semantic preview benefit). We used English target nouns that can either be capitalized (e.g., We went to the critically acclaimed Ballet of Paris while on vacation.) or not (e.g., We went to the critically acclaimed ballet that was showing in Paris.) and manipulated the capitalization of the preview accordingly, to determine if capitalization modulates preview benefit in English. The gaze-contingent boundary paradigm was used with identical, semantically related, and unrelated previews. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found numerically larger preview benefits when the preview/target was capitalized than when it was lowercase.

To determine how assessment fidelity is being addressed in reading intervention research, we systematically reviewed 46 studies conducted with students in Grades K–8 identified as having a reading disability or at-risk for reading failure. Articles were coded for features such as the number and type of tests administered, experience and role of examiners, tester to student ratio, initial and follow-up training provided, monitoring procedures, testing environment, and scoring procedures. Findings suggest assessment integrity data are rarely reported. We discuss the results in a framework of potential threats to assessment fidelity and the implications of these threats for interpreting intervention study res..."

This article reviews empirical data and legal remedies on sexual harassment in rental housing, comparing these with harassment in employment contexts. Using data drawn from Title VIII sexual harassment cases, the authors present 3 studies designed to examine the nature of sexual harassment in housing. Despite overall similarities to its workplace counterpart, a number of distinctive characteristics of residential harassment were evident; in particular, the phenomena of home invasion and masculine possessiveness have no apparent workplace parallels. Housing sexual harassment often takes place in the victim's home, creating an intensely threatening atmosphere. Legal and public policy implications are discussed."

Previous research has typically focused on specific factors that affect the use of a single, specific fluency source. In the present study we examine how cognitive mindsets, or processing modes, moderate fluency emanating from two simultaneous sources of fluency. As a cognitive mindset manipulation, participants performed Jacoby’s process dissociation paradigm. Subsequently, participants engaged in a metamemory task that incorporates (and can separately measure the influence of) two simultaneous sources of fluency: familiarity and accessibility. Our results confirmed that our content-unrelated mindset procedure had affected the use of fluency. Moreover, the use of both fluency sources was attenuated, demonstrating the generality of the effect. The findings highlight the causal dependency of fluency on a complex, cognitively-rich environment."

Development of their theories by Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers serve as examples of the tacit use of methodical hermeneutics.With respect to qualitative research, the phenomenological psychological and grounded theory methods are connected with the concept of a human science approach to the social and health sciences, and are examined critically to expose the hermeneutic involvement in them. A call is put out for a meta-methodology of qualitative research based on the methodical type of hermeneutics. Benefits of such a methodology are suggested, especially enhanced integration of the theory and research in humanistic psychology. 1Division 32 (Humanistic) Presidential Address under the title, Hermeneutics and Humanistic Psychology, given at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association, New Orleans, August 2006."

We describe the content and format of these prevention programs in general and examine selected programs for effectiveness. Although there is limited evidence for an increase in knowledge for program participants, most evaluations suffer from basic design problems and present few results indicative of either primary prevention or detection. Overall, we argue that self-protection against sexual abuse is a very complex process for any child and that few, if any, prevention programs are comprehensive enough to have a meaningful impact on this process. Finally, we discuss several untested assumptions that guide these programs. We conclude that it is unclear whether prevention programs are working or even that they are more beneficial than harmful.

These constructs have been proposed to be closely related, but previous research failed to substantiate a strong correlation between executive control and the other two constructs. This might arise from the difficulty in establishing executive control as a latent variable and from differences in the way the 3 constructs are measured (i.e., executive control is typically measured through reaction times, whereas WMC and gF are measured through accuracy). The purpose of the present study was to overcome these difficulties by measuring executive control through accuracy. Despite good reliabilities of all measures, structural equation modeling identified no coherent factor of executive control. Furthermore, WMC and gF—modeled as distinct but correlated factors—were unrelated to the individual measures of executive control. Hence, measuring executive control through accuracy did not overcome the difficulties of establishing executive control as a latent variable. These findings call into question the existence of executive control as a psychometric construct and the assumption that WMC and gF are closely related to the ability to control ongoing thoughts and actions."

We tested a new model of damage award decision making by systematically varying the size, context, and meaningfulness of numerical comparisons or anchors. As a result, we were able to elicit large differences in award amounts that replicated for 2 different cases. Although even arbitrary dollar amounts (unrelated to the cases) influenced the size of award judgments, the most consistent effects of numerical anchors were achieved when the amounts were meaningful in the sense that they conveyed the gist of numbers as small or large. Consistent with the model, the ordinal gist of the severity of plaintiff’s damages and defendant’s liability predicted damage awards, controlling for other factors such as motivation for the award-judgment task and perceived economic damages. Contrary to traditional dual-process approaches, numeracy and cognitive style (e.g., need for cognition and cognitive reflection) were not significant predictors of these numerical judgments, but they were associated with lower levels of variability once the gist of the judgments was taken into account.

We hypothesized that concerns about discrimination based on one�s social class (i.e., class-based rejection sensitivity or RS-class) would be damaging to undergraduates� achievement outcomes particularly among entity theorists, who perceive their personal characteristics as fixed. We reasoned that a perceived capacity for personal growth and change, characteristic of incremental theorists, would make the pursuit of a college degree and upward mobility seem more worthwhile and attainable. We found evidence across 3 studies that dispositionally held and experimentally primed entity (vs. incremental) beliefs predicted college academic performance as a function of RS-class. Studies 1a and 1b documented that high levels of both entity beliefs and RS-class predicted lower self-reported and official grades, respectively, among undergraduates from socioeconomically diverse backgrounds. In Study 2, high entity beliefs and RS-class at matriculation predicted decreased year-end official grades among lower class Latino students. Study 3 established the causal relationship of entity (vs. incremental) beliefs on academic test performance as a function of RS-class. We observed worse test performance with higher RS-class levels following an entity (vs. incremental) prime, an effect driven by lower income students. Findings from a 4th study suggest that entity theorists with RS-class concerns tend to believe less in upward mobility and, following academic setbacks, are prone to personal attributions of failure, as well as hopelessness.

Results were analyzed with a seed point correlational method for functional connectivity from four seed points based on prior studies: inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, the occipital region, and cerebellum. At Time 1 before treatment, a significant difference in fMRI connectivity occurred between children with dyslexia and normal reading controls in the left inferior frontal gyrus and its correlations with right and left middle frontal gyrus, right and left supplemental motor area, left precentral gyrus, and right superior frontal gyrus.

We also examined the learning time for writing, teachers’ views on writing and writing instruction, how efficacious they feel about teaching writing, and how skilled they are in the writing instruction domain. Lastly, we explored relations between classroom practices, learning time, and teachers’ beliefs and skills through correlation analysis, to identify potential aids and constraints to guide innovations in writing education. Participants were 61 teachers of 45 primary schools in the Netherlands. Data were collected through questionnaires, stimulated recall interviews and over 100 lesson observations. Results indicated that the three domain-specific approaches for writing instruction were insufficiently implemented in Dutch classrooms, as were differentiating and the teaching of learning strategies. The allocated learning time was also insufficient, but the realized learning time and the extent to which teachers promoted active learning were satisfactory, providing a strong basis for curricular improvement.

Building on construal level theory (Trope & Liberman, 2010), we propose a bidirectional relationship between psychological distance and causal focus, such that distance (vs. proximity) leads to a greater focus on causes (vs. consequences), and likewise, focusing on causes (vs. consequences) leads to greater estimates of psychological distance from events. This should be the case because causes are features of events that are more high-level relative to consequences (as shown in Experiments 1 and 2). We demonstrate that temporal (Experiment 3) and social (Experiment 4) distances lead to a greater tendency to focus on the causes (vs. consequences) of events and that, conversely, thinking about causes (vs. consequences) leads to greater perceptions of temporal (Experiment 5) and spatial (Experiment 6) distances from events. Additionally, we explored some downstream effects of this distance-dependent focus on causes versus consequences for predictive judgments, experiences, and behavioral choice (Experiments 7, 8, and 9).

Even smart, educated, emotionally stable adults have superstitions that are not rational. Dual process models--such as the corrective model advocated by Kahneman and Frederick (2002, 2005), which suggests that System 1 generates intuitive answers that may or may not be corrected by System 2--are useful for illustrating why superstitious thinking is widespread, why particular beliefs arise, and why they are maintained even though they are not true. However, to understand why superstitious beliefs are maintained even when people know they are not true requires that the model be refined. It must allow for the possibility that people can recognize--in the moment--that their belief does not make sense, but act on it nevertheless. People can detect an error, but choose not to correct it, a process I refer to as acquiescence. The first part of the article will use a dual process model to understand the psychology underlying magical thinking, highlighting features of System 1 that generate magical intuitions and features of the person or situation that prompt System 2 to correct them. The second part of the article will suggest that we can improve the model by decoupling the detection of errors from their correction and recognizing acquiescence as a possible System 2 response.

Using a sample of 14,464 students from 48 institutions, the authors constructed hierarchical regression models to measure the predictive validity of the Student Readiness Inventory, a measure of psychosocial factors. Controlling for institutional effects and traditional predictors, the authors tested the effects of motivational and skill, social, and self-management measures on academic performance and retention. Academic Discipline was incrementally predictive of academic performance (grade-point average) and retention. Social Activity and Emotional Control also helped predict academic performance and retention, whereas Commitment to College and Social Connection offered incremental prediction of retention. This study elaborates recent meta-analytic findings (S. Robbins et al., 2004), demonstrating the salience of a subset of motivational, social, and self-management factors. Future research questions include how measures of psychosocial factors can be used to aid students, the salience of these measures over the entire college experience and for predicting job performance, and the need for testing theoretical models for explaining postsecondary educational outcomes incorporating traditional, motivational, self-management, and social engagement factors."

Recent research indicates that the ability of an extraneous formant to impair intelligibility depends on the variation of its frequency contour. This study explored the effects of manipulating the depth and pattern of that variation. Three formants (F1+F2+F3) constituting synthetic analogues of natural sentences were distributed across the 2 ears, together with a competitor for F2 (F2C) that listeners must reject to optimize recognition (left = F1+F2C; right = F2+F3). The frequency contours of F1 − F3 were each scaled to 50% of their natural depth, with little effect on intelligibility. Competitors were created either by inverting the frequency contour of F2 about its geometric mean (a plausibly speech-like pattern) or using a regular and arbitrary frequency contour (triangle wave, not plausibly speech-like) matched to the average rate and depth of variation for the inverted F2C. Adding a competitor typically reduced intelligibility; this reduction depended on the depth of F2C variation, being greatest for 100%-depth, intermediate for 50%-depth, and least for 0%-depth (constant) F2Cs. This suggests that competitor impact depends on overall depth of frequency variation, not depth relative to that for the target formants. The absence of tuning (i.e., no minimum in intelligibility for the 50% case) suggests that the ability to reject an extraneous formant does not depend on similarity in the depth of formant-frequency variation. Furthermore, triangle-wave competitors were as effective as their more speech-like counterparts, suggesting that the selection of formants from the ensemble also does not depend on speech-specific constraints."

This is because change in central symptoms (relative to others) should have greater impact on change in all other symptoms. It has been argued that networks derived from cross-sectional data may help identify such important symptoms. We tested this hypothesis in social anxiety disorder. Method: We first estimated a state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation network based on participants with social anxiety disorder (n = 910) to determine which symptoms were more central. Next, we tested whether change in these central symptoms were indeed more related to overall symptom change in a separate dataset of participants with social anxiety disorder who underwent a variety of treatments (n = 244). We also tested whether relatively superficial item properties (infrequency of endorsement and variance of items) might account for any effects shown for central symptoms. Results: Centrality indices successfully predicted how strongly changes in items correlated with change in the remainder of the items. Findings were limited to the measure used in the network and did not generalize to three other measures related to social anxiety severity. In contrast, infrequency of endorsement showed associations across all measures. Conclusions: The transfer of recently published results from cross-sectional network analyses to treatment data is unlikely to be straightforward.

Therefore, in contrast to most previous studies, we used discrete reading tasks. Serial RAN tasks for objects, colors, digits, and letters were included. First, we examined whether the RAN tasks loaded on the same constructs across time. An alphanumeric and a nonalphanumeric factor were identified, which were invariant over time.

Previous research conducted in English has obtained contradictory results regarding the effects of valence on word recognition. Whereas some studies indicate that valence predicts recognition latencies such that negative words are processed more slowly than positive words, other studies indicate facilitation of responses to emotional (both positive and negative) compared to neutral words. The authors examined the influence of valence and arousal on word recognition reaction time (RT) using large-scale word naming and lexical decision data-sets in Spanish. They found that linear mixed-effects model estimates revealed a valence but not an arousal effect on reading latencies. The influence of valence was better captured by a graded (RTs to positive words< neutral< negative) than by a categorical (positive< negative) valence effect. A categorical emotional versus neutral effect was not reliably observed. In an advance on previous research, the authors' analyses showed that the valence effect is substantially more prominent in lexical decision than in pronunciation.

These findings appear to contradict the conventional wisdom that rejection is a particularly effective means of eliciting socially desirable behavior in others. Examples abound of how effective societies, cliques, parents, or romantic partners use rejection to elicit ingratiation, that is, benign, accommodating, or even obsequious behavior intended to gain or regain acceptance. Empirical verification of the link between rejection and ingratiation had been the goal of an earlier wave of research on rejection begun in the 1950s (Geller, Goodstein, Silver, & Sternberg, 1974; Mettee, Taylor, & Fisher, 1971; Pepitone & Wilpizeski, 1960; Saltzstein, 1975; Schachter, 1951). The mixed results of that research suggested the need to focus on identifying the conditions under which rejection motivates ingratiation. However, research on rejection waned before its relation to ingratiation was captured empirically. In this paper, we return to this question.

By integrating insights from classic work on the rejection-ingratiation link and from the recent work on the antisocial consequences of rejection, we propose that two conditions are necessary for rejection to elicit ingratiation. First, the possibility of influencing the rejecter must exist. Second, the rejection must be highly threatening. Taken together this means that rejection will be most likely to trigger ingratiation when the rejectee has nothing left to lose and potentially something of value to gain. We test this prediction in four experiments."

The findings indicate that discrete emotions have distinctive goals and action tendencies, as well as thoughts and feelings. In addition, they provide empirical support for hypothesized emotion states that have received insufficient attention from researchers."

According to the model, one of the most important aspects of motion planning is establishing a constraint hierarchy - a set of prioritized requirements defining the task to be performed. For grasping, constraints include avoiding collisions with the to-be-grasped objects and minimizing movement-related effort. These and other constraints are combined with instant retrieval (recall of stored postures) and instance generation (generation of new postures and movements to them) to simulate flexible prehension. Dynamic deadline setting is used to regulate termination of instance generation, and performance of more than one movement at a time with a single effector is used to permit obstacle avoidance.

Much less is known about how this linkage unfolds developmentally, particularly during times like adolescence, when youngsters’ self-views are typically in flux. Here we explore the self-esteem of adolescent females over a 2.5-year period, and how it covaries with trajectories of vascular function assessed over the same timeframe. Method: One-hundred and thirty adolescent females completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale every 6 months for 2.5 years. Vascular function was measured three times over the same period, using peripheral artery tonometry. Indices of endothelial function and arterial stiffness were derived from these measurements. Results: Hierarchical Linear Modeling revealed an association between self-esteem variability and arterial stiffness trajectories, 9.0 10 3 , SE 4.4 10 3 , p .04. To the extent that their self-esteem fluctuated over the 2.5-year study, participants showed increasing trajectories of arterial stiffness, independent of various demographic and biobehavioral confounders. This association was also independent of participants’ trait-like self-esteem over the same period of time. Neither trait self-esteem nor self-esteem variability was related to endothelial function. Conclusion: These findings suggest that fluctuating self-esteem may accelerate the early stages of vascular stiffening in young women, regardless of whether self-views are generally positive or negative."

Few studies have investigated orthographic processing in dyslexic children and it is not yet clear whether lexical and sublexical orthographic processing are both impaired in these children. The present study examined orthographic processing in dyslexic children (N = 19, below-average word reading as well as below average spelling skills, T-values <40) and typically developing children (N = 32) aged 8–10 years. Different aspects of orthographic processing were measured. Word-specific knowledge (lexical level) was assessed with an Orthographic Choice Task. General orthographic knowledge (sublexical level) was assessed with three pseudoword tasks. The Freq-Choice-Task is a choice task that measures children’s knowledge of frequent double consonants (e.g., nilemm–nilebb). The Pos-Choice-Task measures children’s knowledge about legal positions of double consonants (e.g., sinnum–ssinum). The Pos-Speed-Task measures children’s ability to identify orthographic irregularities in words presented singly (e.g., mmotin). Results show that dyslexic children are able to discriminate illegal/infrequent letter pattern from legal/frequent letter pattern. Seeing either a word with legal or illegal letter patterns singly (Pos-Speed-Task), dyslexic children show deficits in identifying illegal letter pattern as wrong, whereas they have no problems to identify legal letter pattern as correct. Furthermore, dyslexic children show a reduced word specific orthographic knowledge. Additionally, the present study demonstrated that word representations as well as sensitivity to legal letter pattern influence reading and spelling performance."

In addition, the relationship between sensitivity to orthographic regularities and reading and spelling performance was explored. Two aspects of children’s sensitivity to orthographic regularities (sensitivity to frequent double consonants and sensitivity to legal positions of double consonants) were measured with a nonword forced choice task. The results show that sensitivity to orthographic regularities improved significantly from kindergarten to first grade. Moreover, children’s sensitivity to orthographic regularities at the end of first grade accounted for a significant amount of unique variance in their reading and spelling performance. These results suggest that orthographic sensitivity on a sublexical level is important for the development of reading and spelling skills."

However, it is unknown whether class-average levels of intelligence influence teachers’ nominations as suggested by theory—and corresponding empirical results—concerning reference group effects. Herein, it was hypothesized that when students’ individual fluid and crystallized intelligence scores were similar, students from classes with higher average levels of intelligence would have a lower probability of being nominated for an enrichment program for gifted children than students from classes with lower average levels of intelligence. Furthermore, we investigated whether 3 teacher variables—experience with giftedness, beliefs about the changeability of intelligence, and the belief that giftedness is holistic or domain specific—would influence the expected reference group effect. In a study comprising data from 105 teachers and 1,468 of their (German) third-grade students, we found support not only for a positive association between students’ individual intelligence scores and the probability that students would be nominated as gifted but also, more importantly, for the proposed reference group effect: When controlling for individual levels of intelligence, students’ probability of being nominated was higher in classes with lower average levels of intelligence. In addition, the results showed that this reference group effect was stronger when teachers saw giftedness as holistic rather than domain specific. Also, depending on teachers’ kinds of experience with giftedness, the reference group effect varied in size. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

Phoneme similarity modulated performance of the control and the dyscalculia groups and showed a very small effect in the dyslexia group.

High school and university students read texts that presented competing theories for ongoing scientific problems (e.g., the gradualist vs. catastrophic theories of dinosaur extinction) under two conditions: an integrated-text format versus a separate-text format. The integrated-text format was designed to portray science as inquiry and offered each theory as a possible solution to the scientific problem. The separate text presented the two theories successively in separate texts and made no mention of their conflicting nature. In general, the integrated-text format tended to facilitate performance on tests that measured integration of ideas rather than memory for discrete facts. The study showed that successful learning is also affected by learner characteristics, such as the maturity of the learner's epistemic views about knowledge and the capacity of the learner's working memory.

Previous work has also shown that inferences from faces can be predictive of important outcomes within cultures. The current research merges these two lines of work.

Perceivers showed high agreement in their ratings of the faces, regardless of culture, and both sets of judgments were predictive of an important ecological outcome (the percentage of votes that each candidate received in the actual election). The traits predicting electoral success differed, however, depending on the targets' culture. Thus, when American and Japanese participants were asked to provide explicit inferences of how likely each candidate would be to win an election (Studies 3-4), judgments were predictive only for same-culture candidates. Attempts to infer the electoral success for the foreign culture showed evidence of self-projection. Therefore, perceivers can reliably infer predictive information from faces but require knowledge about the target's culture to make these predictions accurately."
START,START,1590789497,the structure of phonological awareness among kindergarten students,2006,"timothy j runge, marley w watkins",school psychology review,1,20,75,"Abstract. Phonological awareness, an understanding that spoken language is comprised of individual sounds, is an important construct that has implications for educational assessment and intervention. Unfortunately, the relationship between phonological awareness and its many operationalizations is ambiguous, resulting in both theoretical and practical difficulties. The present study clarified this situation by factor analyzing 23 preliteracy tests among a sample of 161 kindergarten students to determine the dimensionality of phonological awareness. Exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation revealed that phonological awareness is best understood as a two-dimensional construct among these students. The first dimension was defined by sound categorization, blending, segmenting, and manipulation tasks. This factor thus taps identification and manipulation of phonemes. The second factor was loaded by rhyming tasks. It is therefore the ability to recognize and create rhyming words. Letter knowledge and rapid serial naming emerged as factors separate from phonological awareness. ********** Phonological awareness has received considerable recognition in the past few decades as a robust predictor of reading (e.g., Bradley & Bryant, 1983; Mann, 1993; McBride-Chang & Kail, 2002; Schatschneider, Fletcher, Francis, Carlson, & Foorman, 2004; Stanovich, Cunningham, & Cramer, 1984; Yopp, 1988). Phonological awareness is the understanding that oral language (i.e., sentences, words, syllables) can be divided into smaller components and manipulated. Thus, sentences can be divided into words, words into syllables, and syllables into phonemes. Phonemes are the smallest consciously distinguishable unit of spoken language (Torgesen & Mathes, 2000). A wealth of studies has verified the predictive power of phonological awareness on reading achievement (e.g., Mann, 1993; Stanovich et al., 1984) with some suggesting a reciprocal association between the two constructs (e.g., Ehri & Wilce, 1980; Perfetti, Beck, Ball, & Hughes, 1987). Given that phonological awareness may developmentally precede reading readiness and letter identification (Adams, 1990), its notable predictive power is important from a prevention perspective. Federal initiatives, including Reading First under No Child Left Behind (U.S. Department of Education, 2002), emphasize frequent assessment of preliteracy skills and implementation of research-based interventions to reduce the incidence rate of reading difficulties. Owing to the strong relationship between phonological awareness and reading, it has been recommended that teachers assess beginning readers to ensure proper development of phonological awareness skills (Consortium on Reading Excellence, 1999). Likewise, researchers have been encouraged to accurately assess phonological awareness (Sodoro, Allinder, & Rankin-Erickson, 2002). However, there has been little agreement on operationalization of the construct of phonological awareness, and it has been measured by many different tests (Sodoro et al., 2002). In an attempt to bring order to this inchoate field, Adams (1990) operationally categorized phonological awareness into five different tasks, including knowledge of rhymes, sound categorization, blending, segmentation, and manipulation. Rhyming tasks require the individual to recognize or create rhyming words. In sound categorization tasks, the individual must decide which words start or end with the same or different sounds. An individual is asked to combine a string of sounds into a recognizable word in blending tasks and break apart words into constituent sounds in segmenting tasks. Manipulation tasks require the person to delete a particular sound or substitute one sound with another. Given the various methods by which an individual's development of phonological awareness can be assessed, it is important to investigate the latent constructs that collectively represent phonological awareness. …"

The SINM models interest as a dynamic relational construct, in which different interest components, that is, affective, behavioral, and cognitive components and related motivational components mutually reinforce one another within the development of interest. The dynamical relational perspective hypothesizes that the mutual interactions between interest components underlie the development of interest. Applying the SINM to the PISA 2015 data of 2 countries, that is, the Netherlands and Colombia, we were able to not only illuminate the structure of interactions between the different variables (i.e., indicators) in the networks of different groups of adolescents but we could also make predictions about which variables are of structural importance within the interest construct and as such worthwhile to test as potential candidates for intervention. Additionally, we were able to replicate earlier findings of the literature, namely that (a) enjoyment is central within the interest network and that (b) important structural differences exist in the interest network across countries, which, for instance, point to differences in domain specificity of interest between countries. While the network approach is sensitive to structural differences in science interest across countries, the network structure is stable across subgroups within countries. Future studies are proposed to test theoretically important assumptions of a dynamical perspective on interest, such as the causal role of different interest components in the development of interest.

In this context, children grow up speaking a Spoken Arabic Vernacular (SAV), which is an exclusively spoken language, but later learn to read another linguistically related form, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Forty-two first-grade Arabic native speaking children were given five measures of basic reading processes: two cognitive (rapid automatized naming and short-term working memory), two phonological (phoneme discrimination and phoneme isolation), and one orthographic (letter recoding speed). In addition, the study produced independent measures of phonological processing for MSA phonemes (phonemes that are not within the spoken vernacular of children) and SAV phonemes (phonemes that are familiar to children from their oral vernacular). The relevance of these skills to MSA pseudoword reading fluency (words correct per minute) in vowelized Arabic was tested. The results showed that all predictor measures, except phoneme discrimination, correlated with pseudoword reading fluency. Although phonological processing (phoneme isolation and discrimination) for MSA phonemes was more challenging than that for SAV phonemes, phonological skills were not found to affect reading fluency directly. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the strongest predictor of reading fluency in vowelized Arabic was letter recoding speed. Letter recoding speed was predicted by memory, rapid naming, and phoneme isolation. The results are discussed in light of Arabic diglossia and the shallow orthography of vowelized Arabic."

Several researchers have claimed that WM training fosters not only skills such as visuospatial WM and short-term memory (STM), but also abilities outside the domain of WM, such as fluid intelligence and mathematics. Other researchers, while acknowledging the positive effect of WM training on WM-related cognitive skills, are much more pessimistic about the ability of WM training to improve other cognitive and academic skills. In other words, the idea that far-transfer-that is, the generalization of a set of skills across two domains only loosely related to each other-may take place in WM training is still controversial. In this meta-analysis, the authors focused on the effects of WM training on cognitive and academic skills (e.g., fluid intelligence, attention/inhibition, mathematics, and literacy) in typically developing (TD) children (aged 3 to 16). Whereas WM training exerted a significant effect on cognitive skills related to WM training (g = 0.46), little evidence was found regarding far-transfer effects (g = 0.12). Moreover, the size of the effects was inversely related to the quality of the design (i.e., random allocation to the groups and presence of an active control group). Results suggest that WM training is ineffective at enhancing TD children's cognitive or academic skills and that, when positive effects are observed, they are modest at best. Thus, in line with other types of training, far-transfer rarely occurs and its effects are minimal."

In a deception paradigm, participants believed they were engaged in a computer-mediated mock jury deliberation about a murder case. In actuality, the interaction was scripted. The script included 5 other mock jurors who provided verdicts and comments in support of the verdicts; 4 agreed with the participant and 1 was a ""holdout"" dissenter. Holdouts expressed their opinions with no emotion, anger, or fear and had either male or female names. Holdouts exerted no influence on participants' opinions when they expressed no emotion or fear. Participants' confidence in their own verdict dropped significantly, however, after male holdouts expressed anger. Yet, anger expression undermined female holdouts: Participants became significantly more confident in their original verdicts after female holdouts expressed anger-even though they were expressing the exact same opinion and emotion as the male holdouts. Mediation analyses revealed that participants drew different inferences from male versus female anger, which created a gender gap in influence during group deliberation. The current study has implications for group decisions in general, and jury deliberations in particular, by suggesting that expressing anger might lead men to gain influence, but women to lose influence over others (even when making identical arguments). These diverging consequences might result in women potentially having less influence on societally important decisions than men, such as jury verdicts. (PsycINFO Database Record Language: en"

Consequently, we focused on the role that both stable and time-varying psychosocial risk and protective factors play in dropout intentions and actual dropout, using a 4-year longitudinal design. We investigated to what extent dropout intentions and dropout can be predicted by an interplay between negative life events, general self-efficacy, and perceived social support. We distinguished between time-averaged levels of self-efficacy and social support, and within-person change in self-efficacy and social support over time. This enabled us to establish whether dropout intentions and dropout were sensitive to fluctuations in perceived self-efficacy and social support over time when controlling for person-specific levels of these psychosocial resources. Calculating multilevel models with data from a prospective cohort study (N = 4,956, 43% male), we found that negative life events were significantly associated with an increase in dropout intentions and the likelihood of school dropout. Furthermore, time-averaged levels of self-efficacy and social support, and a within-person (situational) increase in these characteristics relative to their time-averaged levels, were related to lower levels of dropout intentions but did not prevent dropout. The positive relationship between negative life events and dropout intentions was attenuated for individuals who perceived higher levels of self-efficacy than usual. Our findings suggest future research should further investigate time-averaged and situational psychosocial drivers of school dropout in combination.

Lower print knowledge in Scandinavian twins was related to country differences in preschool print environment. Latent-trait behavioral-genetic analyses indicated very strong shared-environment influences on individual differences in Print Knowledge. Genetic influence was also significant. Several other prereading skills varied in their environmental and genetic influence, including a significant contrast between Phonological Awareness and Print Knowledge. Rapid Naming also revealed very strong genetic influence, as did Verbal Memory. Stronger shared-environment influences were found for Vocabulary and Grammar/Morphology. Genetic and environmental correlations among latent traits for General Verbal Ability, Phonological Awareness, and Print Knowledge were high, but there were also significant independent genetic and environmental contributions to each skill. Practical implications include the need for substantial and sustained instructional support for children hampered by genetic constraints on early literacy development."

The relative standing of the intellectually gifted adolescents on moral reasoning, however, appears to be due to their superior level of verbal ability as opposed to any of a number of the other psychological variables examined here. The hypothesis that the DIT is conceptually distinct from conventional measures of verbal ability was not confirmed. Investigators conducting subsequent studies involving the assessment of moral reasoning are advised to incorporate measures of verbal ability into their designs, thereby enabling them to ascertain whether moral reasoning measures are indeed capturing systematic sources of individual differences distinct from verbal ability. This idea also is relevant to other concepts and measures purporting to assess optimal forms of human functioning more generally (e.g., creativity, ego development, and self-actualization )."

A representative sample of 973 Dutch children in the first grade (Mage = 6;1, SD = 0;5) was exposed to incremental subsets of Dutch grapheme–phoneme correspondences during 6 consecutive blocks of 3 weeks of phonics instruction. Children’s accuracy and efficiency of curriculum embedded word decoding were assessed after each incremental block, followed by a standardized word decoding measurement. Precursor measures of rapid naming, short-term memory, vocabulary, phonological awareness, and letter knowledge were assessed by the end of kindergarten and subsequently related to the word decoding efficiency in the first grade. The results showed that from the very beginning, children attained ceiling levels of decoding accuracy, whereas their efficiency scores increased despite the incremental character of the consecutive decoding assessments embedded in the curriculum. Structural equation modelling demonstrated high stability of the individual differences assessed by word decoding efficiency during phonics instruction during the first 5 months of the first grade. Curriculum embedded word decoding was highly related to standardized word decoding after phonics instruction was completed. Finally, early literacy and lexical retrieval, and to a lesser extent verbal and visual short term memory, predicted the first fundamental processes of mastering word decoding skills."

We hypothesized that impacts of visual acuity on AVL are mediated by perceived functional vision losses and functional abilities, and tested for ""adaptive"" weakening of this impact with ongoing loss. Longitudinal data covering a one-year interval from samples with age-related macular degeneration gathered in New York (N = 361) and Heidelberg (Germany, N = 90) were used. We analyzed the hypothesized causal structure by modeling latent change scores, and checked if those with low, medium, and high levels of vision loss at baseline differ in the relations between one-year change scores. Results confirmed that impacts of vision loss on AVL are mediated by decline in functional ability. However, under the most severe levels of vision loss at baseline, functional decline showed only a minor impact on AVL change not explained by a lack of further decline in vision. Findings confirm the effectiveness of adaptation in terms of reduced reactivity to functional losses across increasing level of chronic impairment. Thus, adaptation, weakening the impact of chronic functional impairment on psychological outcomes over time with disease progression, deserves consideration in the study of psychological consequences of chronic physical health conditions in old age."
START,START,2115918068,behavioral vs cognitive views of speech perception and production,2010,henry d schlinger,NA,0,2,65,"Introduction The study of speech perception and production has been dominated largely by cognitively oriented researchers and theorists. However, cognitive theories do not translate well into actually teaching speech and language. Because of its emphasis on behavior and its foundation of experimentally derived principles of learning, operant learning theory, on the other hand, has for more than 40 years been used to successfully teach speech and language, especially to people with a variety of speech and language disorders (e.g., Camarata, 1993; DeLeon, Arnold, Rodriguez-Catter, & Uy, 2003; Hegde, 1998; Hegde, 2007; Hegde & Maul, 2006; Johnston, & Johnston, 1972; Lancaster et al., 2004; Pena-Brooks & Hegde, 2007; Wagaman, Miltenberger, & Arndorfer, 1993). Although there is a fair amount of behavioral research on teaching verbal behavior to people with speech and language disorders, with few exceptions (e.g., Guess, Sailor, Rutherford, & Baer, 1968; Whitehurst, 1972; Whitehurst, Ironsmith, & Goldfein, 1974) behavioral scientists have not contributed much basic research on speech perception or production. What behavior analysis can offer language researchers and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is a coherent and parsimonious interpretation of speech consistent with experimentally established scientific principles of learning that has immediate practical applications. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate a general behavioral approach to speech perception and production and to contrast it with the traditional cognitive account. The task of interpreting the traditional speech perception and production literature from a behavior analytic perspective is not as onerous as one might imagine, given that much of the research either incorporates relatively straightforward operant conditioning methods or methods that are amenable to an operant analysis. Contrasting Views of Perception Cognitive Views of Perception Traditional treatments describe sensation in terms of the effects of stimuli on sensory receptors. Perception, on the other hand, has generally been referred to as how the brain interprets sensory experience, or more formally as: ...the process by which animals gain knowledge about their environment and about themselves in relation to the environment. It is the beginning of knowing and so is an essential part of cognition. More specifically, to perceive is to obtain information about the world through stimulation. (Gibson & Spelke, 1983, p. 2) The main problem with such descriptions is that gaining knowledge, knowing, and obtaining information are inferred solely from observable behavioral evidence and, thus, do not add much to our understanding. Moreover, placing perception inside the brain, as some descriptions do, only moves the level of analysis further away from the actual behaviors involved when one speaks of perception. And talking about the brain as if it is doing something--perceiving--is an example of what I refer to as the brain-as-person metaphor because organisms, not brains, perceive, that is, behave. Descriptions of the development of perception in infants are equally vague. For example, according to Gallahue (1989), ""newborns attach little meaning to sensory stimuli"" but very soon infants begin to attach meaning and attend to specific stimuli and to identify objects (p. 184). But what does that mean? These verbs do not refer to specific behaviors that can be studied but rather labels for a variety of behaviors. To understand what it means to attend, to identify or to attach meaning, we would need to observe what newborns actually do and the circumstances under which they do it when researchers use such terms. And we should not be surprised if the behaviors and circumstances vary considerably from instance to instance. Furthermore, such characterizations raise a more fundamental question: Why do infants begin to attach meaning or attend to specific stimuli? …"

In the experimental literature, two prominent models have been advanced as psychological descriptions of preferences for sequences. In one model, the instantaneous utilities of the outcomes in a sequence are discounted as a function of their delays, and assembled into a discounted utility of the sequence. In the other model, the ccumulated utility of the outcomes in a sequence is considered along with utility or
disutility from improvement in outcome utilities and utility or disutility from the spreading of outcome utilities. Drawing on three threads of evidence concerning preferences for sequences of monetary gains, we propose that the accumulated utility of the outcomes in a sequence is traded off against the duration of utility accumulation. In our first experiment, aggregate choice behavior provides qualitative support for the tradeoff model. In three subsequent experiments, one of which
incentivized, disaggregate choice behavior provides quantitative support for the tradeoff model in Bayesian model contests. The third experiment addresses one thread of evidence that motivated the tradeoff model: When, in the choice between two single dated outcomes, it is conveyed that receiving less sooner means receiving nothing later, preference for receiving more later increases, but when it is conveyed that receiving more later means receiving nothing sooner, preference is left unchanged. Our results show that this asymmetric hidden-zero effect is indeed driven by those supporting the tradeoff model. The tradeoff model also accommodates all remaining evidence on preferences for sequences of monetary gains."

The authors investigated the usefulness of this game for the assessment of interactions with a virtual spouse and their relations to intimacy and autonomy motivation as well as relationship satisfaction with the real-life partner. Both the intimacy motive and the satisfaction with the real-world relationship showed significant correlations with aggregated in-game behavior, which shows that some sort of transference between the real world and the virtual world took place.

Schotter (2013) reported preview benefit from a synonymous preview, but it is unclear whether this effect occurs because of similarity between the preview and target (i.e., integration), or because of contextual fit of the preview-synonyms satisfy both accounts. Studies in Chinese have found evidence for preview benefit for words that are unrelated to the target, but are contextually plausible (Yang, Li, Wang, Slattery, & Rayner, 2014; Yang, Wang, Tong, & Rayner, 2012), which is incompatible with an integration account but supports a contextual fit account. Here, we used plausible and implausible unrelated previews in addition to plausible synonym, antonym, and identical previews to further investigate these accounts for readers of English. Early reading measures were shorter for all plausible preview conditions compared to the implausible preview condition. In later reading measures, a benefit for the plausible unrelated preview condition was not observed. In a second experiment, we asked questions that probed whether the reader encoded the preview or target. Readers were more likely to report the preview when they had skipped the word and not regressed to it, and when the preview was plausible. Thus, under certain circumstances, the preview word is processed to a high level of representation (i.e., semantic plausibility) regardless of its relationship to the target, but its influence on reading is relatively short-lived, being replaced by the target word, when fixated.

Marriages fail (Gottman, 1994), coworkers are shamed (Melwani & Barsade, 2011), terrorism is tended toward (Tausch et al., 2011). Despite its importance, contempt has not been investigated at the level of personality. The present research examines how our contemptuous reactions can be conceptualized and measured as a stable individual-difference variable with a range of theoretically predicted correlates. First, we introduce a measure of dispositional contempt, the tendency to look down on, distance, and derogate others who violate our standards. We then unpack the dynamics of dispositional contempt. Across 6 studies using self-report and emotion elicitation in student and MTurk samples (Ns = 165 to 1,368), we examined its (a) nomological network, (b) personality and behavioral correlates, and (c) implications for relationship functioning. Dispositional contempt was distinguished from tendencies toward related emotions and was most associated with dispositional envy, anger, and hubristic pride. Somewhat paradoxically, dispositional contempt was related to being cold and “superior,” with associations found with narcissism, other-oriented perfectionism, and various antisocial tendencies (e.g., Disagreeableness, Machiavellianism, racism), but it was also related to being self-deprecating and emotionally fragile, with associations found with low self-esteem, insecure attachment, and feeling that others impose perfectionistic standards on oneself. Dispositional contempt predicted contemptuous reactions to eliciting film clips, particularly when targets showed low competence/power. Finally, perceiving one’s romantic partner as dispositionally contemptuous was associated with lower commitment and satisfaction. Taken together, results give a first look at the contemptuous person and provide a new organizing framework for understanding contempt. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"

Because handshakes are social rituals, they are imbued with meaning beyond their physical features. We propose that during mixed-motive interactions, a handshake is viewed as a signal of cooperative intent, increasing people’s cooperative behavior and affecting deal-making outcomes. In Studies 1a and 1b, pairs who chose to shake hands at the onset of integrative negotiations obtained better joint outcomes. Study 2 demonstrates the causal impact of handshaking using experimental methodology. Study 3 suggests a driver of the cooperative consequence of handshaking: negotiators expected partners who shook hands to behave more cooperatively than partners who avoided shaking hands or partners whose nonverbal behavior was unknown; these expectations of cooperative intent increased negotiators’ own cooperation. Study 4 uses an economic game to demonstrate that handshaking increased cooperation even when handshakes were uninstructed (vs. instructed). Further demonstrating the primacy of signaling cooperative intent, handshaking actually reduced cooperation when the action signaled ill intent (e.g., when the hand-shaker was sick; Study 5). Finally, in Study 6, executives assigned to shake hands before a more antagonistic, distributive negotiation were less likely to lie about self-benefiting information, increasing cooperation even to their own detriment. Together, these studies provide evidence that handshakes, ritualistic behaviors imbued with meaning beyond mere physical contact, signal cooperative intent and promote deal-making.

Adults and 3rd-and 5th-grade children were provided with a set of mental activity scenarios and were asked to select the best verbs from a list of cognitive verbs that might apply to each scenario. Changes in organization were assessed by examining overlapping uses of cognitive verbs in different contexts. There were 3 major changes with development: (a) the understanding of the role of memory in input functions increased, (b) the interrelatedness of memory- and comprehension-related verbs increased, and (c) the importance of cognitive certainty and uncertainty engaged by constructive processing verbs increased. Together, these findings suggest that a constructivist theory of mind develops in later childhood."

It is hypothesized that, for both sexes, the importance of benevolence, universalism, stimulation, hedonism, and self-direction values increases with greater gender equality, whereas the importance of power, achievement, security, and tradition values decreases. Of particular relevance to the present study, increased gender equality should also permit both sexes to pursue more freely the values they inherently care about more. Drawing on evolutionary and role theories, the authors postulate that women inherently value benevolence and universalism more than men do, whereas men inherently value power, achievement, and stimulation more than women do. Thus, as gender equality increases, sex differences in these values should increase, whereas sex differences in other values should not be affected by increases in gender equality. Studies of 25 representative national samples and of students from 68 countries confirmed the hypotheses except for tradition values. Implications for cross-cultural research on sex differences in values and traits are discussed."

The origin of these features has been neglected in theories of object categorization. Do they form a fixed and independent set that exists before experience with objects, or are features progressively extracted and developed as an organism categorizes its world? This paper maintains that features can be flexibly learned, as a consequence of categorizing and representing objects. All three experiments reported in this paper used categories of unfamiliar computer-synthesized two-dimensional objects (""Martian cells""). The results showed that varying order of category learning induced the creation of different features that changed the perceptual appearance and the featural representation of identical category exemplars. Network simulations supported a flexible, rather than a fixed feature interpretation of the data."

This study examined whether a word’s emotional qualities influenced the time spent viewing that word in the context of normal reading. Eye movements were monitored as participants read sentences containing an emotionally positive (e.g., lucky), negative (e.g., angry), or neutral (e.g., plain) word. Target word frequency (high or low) was additionally varied to help determine the temporal locus of emotion effects, with interactive results suggesting an early lexical locus of emotion processing. In general, measures of target fixation time demonstrated significant effects of emotion and frequency as well as an interaction. The interaction arose from differential effects with negative words that were dependent on word frequency. Fixation times on emotion
words (positive or negative) were consistently faster than those on neutral words with one exception — high frequency
negative words were read no faster than their neutral counterparts. These effects emerged in the earliest eye movement measures, namely, first and single fixation duration, suggesting that emotionality, as defined by arousal and valence, modulates lexical processing. Possible mechanisms involved in processing emotion words are discussed, including automatic vigilance and desensitization, both of which imply a key role for word frequency. Finally, it is important that early lexical effects of emotion processing can be established within the ecologically valid context of fluent reading."

A gradient of severity was hypothesized, with the shunted hydrocephalus group expected to exhibit the most significant memory impairments and the arrested group expected to perform more poorly than children with no hydrocephalus . Etiologies of prematurity, spina bifida, and aqueductal stenosis were represented by 157 participants. Results supported the hypothesis; the shunted hydrocephalus group performed poorer on all memory measures. Differences for the arrested group were less frequently statistically significant relative to children with no hydrocephalus. Irrespective of etiology, the shunted hydrocephalus group exhibited a pattern of performance suggestive of encoding and retrieval deficits on both verbal and nonverbal tasks, showing a pervasive disturbance of memory processes. Hydrocephalus represents an increase in cerebral ventricular volume resulting from a disturbance in the balance of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) production and reabsorption that is caused by a structural anomaly or pathological event. Two of the most frequent prenatal etiologies of hydrocephalus are aqueductal stenosis and spina bifida. Aqueductal stenosis refers to a congenital narrowing of the aqueduct of Sylvius that can result in a blockage of CSF, disturbing its circulatory pattern (Menkes, 1995). Spina bifida is a defect of neural tube closure associated with spinal dysraphisms and the Arnold-Chiari II brain malformation.

The most commonly reported major contributors to divorce were lack of commitment, infidelity, and conflict/arguing. The most common “final straw” reasons were infidelity, domestic violence, and substance use. More participants blamed their partners than blamed themselves for the divorce. Recommendations from participants for the improvement of premarital education included receiving relationship education before making a commitment to marry (when it would be easier to break-up), having support for implementing skills outside of the educational setting, and increasing content about the stages of typical marital development.

In addition to addressing the challenging behaviors that many students without disabilities exhibit, more and more students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) are being included in the general education classroom. Effective instruction and the development of effective instructional environments have been demonstrated to decrease problem behaviors in students with histories of failure in school. Positive behavior support (PBS) provides a framework for considering development of instructional environments that increase the teacher's ability to deliver effective instruction to all students, thereby increasing success rates and reducing negative behavior across the school. The same PBS features: prediction, prevention, consistency, and evaluation apply in the classroom to decrease the number of problem behaviors and increase academic and social success. This paper presents a description of the key features of effective classroom PBS and demonstrates each via the use of case examples. The premise of PBS is that the more effectively the environment is designed, more effective it can be in facilitating classrooms that run smoothly and efficiently, allowing teachers to recognize, assess, and plan for students with special needs. Keywords: Emotional and behavioral disorders, classroom management, PBS, and effective instruction ********** In our public schools, classroom teachers deal with a variety of challenging student behaviors. In the minds of most are instances of violence and crime. However, the most common disciplinary referrals are for behaviors whose purpose is to avoid class (i.e., truancy and tardy), followed by fighting and bothering others--also resulting in removal from and therefore avoidance of class (McFadden, March, Price, & Hwang, 1992; Morgan-D'Atrio, Northrup, LaFleur, & Spera, 1996). In addition, many schools continue to report instances of bulling, disrespect, verbal abuse, and general classroom disorder as occurring daily or weekly (DeVoe et al., 2004). But far and away, teachers report that the disruptive behaviors that they are forced to deal with on a daily basis are much less violent and intense, but are far more frequent and usurp great amounts of instructional time (Sprague & Walker, 2000). These behaviors include simple disrespect, failing to follow through with simple instructions, and generally being off-task. All-together, issues related to challenging student behavior are reported by teachers as the most difficult and stressful of their professional lives (Furlong, Morrison, & Dear, 1994; Kuzsman & Schnall, 1987; Safran & Safran, 1988). There is little doubt that teaching in a public school classroom is, to say the least, a demanding job. The multiple dynamics of a classroom can be a challenge for any teacher. Today, however, the role of the classroom teacher is becoming even more multidimensional as teachers are being asked to accommodate for students with more diverse academic and behavioral needs in the general education setting (McLeskey, Henry, & Hodges, 1998). Such situations may require teachers to organize several small group activities throughout the classroom while at the same time providing the instruction or guidance that students with special needs require. All this must occur while simultaneously maintaining some acceptable standard of classroom discipline. In addition to addressing the challenging behaviors that many students without disabilities exhibit (DeVoe et al, 2004), more and more students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) are being included in the general education classroom (Cheney & Barringer, 1995; McLeskey et al., 1999; Sawka et al., 2002).

The model consists of a set of orthographic units used to code letter strings, a set of hidden units, and a set of phonemic units. Weights on connections between units were modified during a training phase using the back-propagation learning algorithm. The model takes letter strings as input and yields two types of output: a pattern of activation across the phonemic units, and a recreation of the input spelling pattern across the orthographic units. The model was trained on a corpus of 2897 English words that included most of the uninflected monosyllabic words in the language. The model provides detailed accounts of performance on two tasks, naming aloud and lexical decision, and simulates many aspects of human performance, including (a) differences between words in terms of processing difficulty; (b) pronunciation of novel items; (c) differences between readers in terms of word recognition skill; (d) transitions from beginning to skilled reading; and (e) differences in performance on the two tasks. The model's behavior early in the learning phase corresponds to that of children acquiring word recognition skills.

We investigated the use of such cross-episode connections in comprehension and memory in six experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 used a priming technique; it was found that verification time for a test sentence from one story was speeded by an immediately preceding test sentence from a thematically similar story but only when subjects were given instructions to rate the similarities of the stories. In the remaining experiments, a single test sentence was presented immediately after a story was read, with timing controlled by presenting the story one word at a time. Response time for a test sentence from a previously read story was facilitated if the immediately preceding story was thematically similar, but only if the previously read story was extensively prestudied. We conclude that, during reading of an episode, thematic information may be encoded so as to lead to activation of similar episodes and formation of connections in memory between episodes, but such encoding is not automatic and depends on subjects' strategies and task difficulty."

In 2 studies, we assessed mind wandering using thought probes while participants performed the metronome response task (MRT), which required them to synchronize button presses with tones. Participants performed this task while sitting on a Wii Balance Board providing us with an index of fidgeting. Results of Study 1 demonstrate that relative to on-task periods, mind wandering is indeed accompanied by increases in fidgeting, as well as increased response variability in the MRT.

We interpret these findings in the context of current theories of mind wandering and suggest that (a) mind wandering is associated with costs not only to primary-task performance but also to secondary-task goals (e.g., controlling extraneous movements) and (b) these costs may depend on the degree to which task-related executive control processes are disengaged during mind wandering (i.e., depth of mind wandering).

We found that mathematicians were more accurate compared with nonmathematicians when mapping positive, but not negative numbers, which are considered numerical primitives and cultural artifacts, respectively. Moreover, performance on positive number mapping could predict whether one is a mathematician or not, and was mediated by more advanced mathematical skills. This finding might suggest a link between basic and advanced mathematical skills. However, when we included visuospatial skills, as measured by block design subtest, the mediation analysis revealed that the relation between the performance in the number line task and the group membership was explained by non-numerical visuospatial skills.

For example, while some languages typically encode the manner of motion in the verb (e.g., running), others more often use verbs that encode the path (e.g., ascending). Prior research has demonstrated that children and adults have lexicalization biases; that is, they assume that novel motion verbs will reflect the dominant pattern of their own language. These experiments explored the plasticity of these biases. In Experiments 1 and 2 we taught English-speaking adults motion verbs, varying the proportion of manner and path verbs in the training set; their interpretation of subsequent verbs closely reflected the probabilistic variation in the input. In Experiments 3 and 4, 5-year-old children also systematically shifted their lexicalization biases to reflect the verbs that they were taught.

Fifth-grade students completed measures of Hebrew reading accuracy and fluency from word to text level as well as phonological awareness (PA), RAN and vocabulary. LM students read single words less accurately than NH students, in contrast to previous findings. This result can be understood in the context of Hebrew reading development, the transition to unvowelized reading at this age and the reduced vocabulary knowledge of the LM group. LM students also had lower accuracy and fluency in reading vowelized, and to a greater extent, unvowelized texts. These findings suggest that developing fluent text reading especially in the unvowelized Hebrew script is challenging for LM students, since it requires integrating linguistic and contextual information. Regression analyses demonstrated that although for NH students both PA and RAN were significant predictors of text reading fluency, for LM students PA was a major predictor of fluency, but RAN was not. This finding indicates that LM students relied on basic reading skills, and were less able to recruit automaticity to support fluent reading. Thus, the current results highlight the challenges of developing fluent reading among LM students, and underscore how patterns of achievement and difficulty might be related to the specific linguistic and orthographic characteristics of the societal language."

The unique problems posed by this ""outlier"" orthography, the author argues, have focused disproportionate attention on oral reading accuracy at the expense of silent reading, meaning access, and fluency, and have significantly distorted theorizing with regard to many issues-including phonological awareness, early reading instruction, the architecture of stage models of reading development, the definition and remediation of reading disability, and the role of lexical-semantic and supralexical information in word recognition. The dominant theoretical paradigm in contemporary (word) reading research-the Coltheart/Baron dual-route model (see, e.g., J. Baron, 1977; M.

Undergraduates (Sample 1 N = 507) completed a battery of self-report measures, all purporting to assess trait ""impulsivity""; a subset (n = 408) and Sample 2 (N = 388) also completed a retrospective questionnaire about specific behaviors they may have engaged in over the past year, and another subset of Sample 1 agreed to complete (n = 208) and actually completed (n = 152) a 2-week prospective measure of impulsive behaviors. Finally, a subset of Sample 1 (n = 321) and Sample 2 completed an omnibus self-report inventory in a follow-up study. Structural equation modeling confirmed a 3-factor structure of what we call impulsigenic traits--traits that are manifested in impulsive behavior. This finding is consistent with previous research and supports the growing consensus that ""impulsivity"" is a colloquial label attached to a group of distinct traits that have phenotypically similar behavioral manifestations. Each of these impulsigenic traits relates differentially to impulsive behavior and to broad temperamental dimensions. The results also show clear 2-factor structures of both daily and less frequent (yearly/semiyearly) impulsive behaviors. Finally, a unique method of data collection permitted an investigation of relations between the impulsigenic and other personality traits and observed behaviors, demonstrating the predictive utility of personality traits to discrete, in situ behaviors.

Ninety-six children were tested twice: first in kindergarten using speed of processing, early literacy, phonological awareness, language and rapid naming speed measures; and a year later in first grade, using speed of processing and different reading ability measures (decoding, reading comprehension, and fluency). The children were divided into three groups according to their performance on the speed of processing measures: slow, average, and fast. In kindergarten, the group with slow SOP exhibited the lowest scores on all the measures, while the groups with average and fast SOP performed better, with no significant difference between them. In first grade, speed of processing skills affected the different reading abilities in a dissimilar way, and the three groups showed different patterns of reading ability. SOP in kindergarten explained approximately 11% of the variance in reading in the 1st grade among the slow and average SOP groups. These findings have implications for early assessment and intervention."

Drawing on an embodied approach to representation, we examined interactions between emotional, sensorimotor, and linguistic sources of information for target words embedded in sentential contexts. Using eye-movement measures for 43 native English speakers, we observed emotional benefits for negative and positive words and sensorimotor benefits for words high in concreteness, but only when target words were low in frequency. Moreover, emotional words were maximally faster than neutral words when words were low in concreteness (i.e., highly abstract), and sensorimotor benefits occurred only when words were not emotionally charged (i.e., emotionally neutral). Furthermore, emotional and concreteness benefits were attenuated by individual differences that attenuate and amplify emotional and sensorimotor information, respectively. Our results suggest that behavior is functionally modulated by embodied information (i.e., emotional and sensorimotor) when linguistic contributions to representation are not enhanced by high frequency. Furthermore, emotional benefits are maximal when words are not already embodied by sensorimotor contributions to representation (and vice versa). Our work is consistent with recent studies that have suggested that abstract words are grounded in emotional experiences, analogous to how concrete words are grounded in sensorimotor experiences."

In contrast, 3 studies provide evidence that parental punishment does socialize morality, but of a particular sort: a morality focused on prohibitions (i.e., proscriptive orientation) rather than positive obligations (i.e., prescriptive orientation). Study 1 found young adults' accounts of parental restrictiveness and punishment activated their sensitivity to prohibitions and predicted a proscriptive orientation. Consistent with the greater potency of temptations for proscriptively oriented children, as well as past research linking shame to proscriptive morality, Study 2 found that restrictive parenting was also associated with greater suppression of temptations. Finally, Studies 3A and 3B found that suppressing these immoral thoughts is paradoxically harder for those with strong proscriptive orientations; more specifically, priming a proscriptive (versus prescriptive) orientation and inducing mental suppression of ""immoral"" thoughts led to the most ego depletion for those with restrictive parents. Overall, individuals who had restrictive parents had the lowest self-regulatory ability to resist their ""immoral"" temptations after prohibitions were activated. In contrast to common attributional explanations, these studies suggest that harsh external control by parents does not undercut moral socialization but rather undermines individuals' ability to resist temptation.

Do they seek out information, or do they simply ignore the threatening issue at hand? One would intuitively expect that a lack of knowledge would motivate an increased, unbiased search for information, thereby facilitating participation and engagement in these issues-especially when they are consequential, pressing, and self-relevant. However, there appears to be a discrepancy between the importance/self-relevance of social issues and people's willingness to engage with and learn about them. Leveraging the literature on system justification theory (Jost & Banaji, 1994), the authors hypothesized that, rather than motivating an increased search for information, a lack of knowledge about a specific sociopolitical issue will (a) foster feelings of dependence on the government, which will (b) increase system justification and government trust, which will (c) increase desires to avoid learning about the relevant issue when information is negative or when information valence is unknown. In other words, the authors suggest that ignorance-as a function of the system justifying tendencies it may activate-may, ironically, breed more ignorance. In the contexts of energy, environmental, and economic issues, the authors present 5 studies that (a) provide evidence for this specific psychological chain (i.e., ignorance about an issue → dependence → government trust → avoidance of information about that issue); (b) shed light on the role of threat and motivation in driving the second and third links in this chain; and (c) illustrate the unfortunate consequences of this process for individual action in those contexts that may need it most."

In Study 1, students completed multiple self-affirmation (or control) activities as part of their regular class assignments. Latino American students, the identity threatened group, earned higher grades in the affirmation than control condition, whereas White students were unaffected. The effects persisted 3 years and, for many students, continued into high school by lifting their performance trajectory. Study 2 featured daily diaries to examine how the affirmation affected psychology under identity threat, with the expectation that it would shape students’ narratives of their ongoing academic experience. By conferring a big-picture focus, affirmation was expected to broaden construals, prevent daily adversity from being experienced as identity threat, and insulate academic motivation from identity threat. Indeed, affirmed Latino American students not only earned higher grades than nonaffirmed Latino American students but also construed events at a more abstract than concrete level and were less likely to have their daily feelings of academic fit and motivation undermined by identity threat.

This kind of guilt is obviously not restricted to war, but war provides an important and timely context for studying it. Imposing guilt on oneself, I argue, is a way of taking responsibility, even if one overimposes it. It can be morally fitting and admirable, even when not justified or warranted. In some cases, it is a way of defending against a harder-to-uncover feeling of shame. Understanding better the notion of moral recovery is urgent. By some counts, the number of suicides in the U.S. military during recent years has exceeded that of deaths due to combat.

Two studies with a total of 569 observations provided initial reliability and validity evidence on the Contemporary Critical Consciousness Measure II (CCCMII).

The theory of constructed emotion hypothesizes that an emotion category is a population of context-specific, highly variable instances that need not share an ANS fingerprint. Instead, ANS variation within a category is a meaningful part of the nature of emotion. We present a meta-analysis of 202 studies measuring ANS reactivity during lab-based inductions of emotion in non-clinical samples of adults, using a random effects, multilevel meta-analysis and multivariate pattern classification analysis to test our hypotheses. We found increases in mean effect size for 59.4% of ANS variables across emotion categories, but the pattern of effect sizes did not clearly distinguish one emotion category from another. We also observed significant variation within emotion categories; heterogeneity accounted for a moderate to substantial percentage (i.e., I2 ≥ 30%) of variability in 54% of these effect sizes. Experimental moderators epiphenomenal to emotion, such as induction type (e.g., films vs. imagery), did not explain a large portion of the variability. Correction for publication bias reduced estimated effect sizes even further, increasing heterogeneity of effect sizes for certain emotion categories. These findings, when considered in the broader empirical literature, are more consistent with population thinking and other principles from evolutionary biology found within the theory of constructed emotion, and offer insights for developing new hypotheses to understand the nature of emotion."

Normally, a high extracellular dopamine level yields a tonic dopaminergic input that down-regulates stimuli-evoked phasic dopamine responses through autoreceptors. Abnormally low tonic extracellular dopamine in ADHD up-regulates the autoreceptors so that stimuli-evoked phasic dopamine is boosted. The authors propose that these boosted phasic responses yield hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli in ADHD. Stimuli evoking moderate brain arousal lead to well-functioning performance, whereas either too little or too much stimuli attenuate cognitive performance. Strong, salient stimuli may easily disrupt attention, whereas an environment with impoverished stimuli causes low arousal, which is typically compensated for by hyperactivity. Stochastic resonance is the phenomenon that makes a moderate noise facilitate stimulus discrimination and cognitive performance. Computational modeling shows that more noise is required for stochastic resonance to occur in dopamine-deprived neural systems in ADHD. This prediction is supported by empirical data."

Sixty-one Finnish-speaking children were followed up once a year from infancy to school start (1 year 0 months–7 years 3 months). Before entering first grade, 43% of the children were classified as emergent readers and 30% as precocious readers. The readers had displayed more rapid vocabulary, inflectional, and metaphonological development than their agemates. Increased awareness of sound patterns emerged well before word reading. However, the striking growth spurt in phonemic awareness can be regarded more as a consequence of than a precursor to reading. The findings suggest that early mastery of words and word inflections increases the likelihood of becoming aware of sound patterns in words. Is the course of language development in very early childhood related to the emergence of reading skills prior to formal literacy instruction in Finnish children? To our knowledge, no study in any language has followed up a representative age group using a large set of measures to tap the relevant milestones of language development from the first year of life until the final months before entering school. In a recent cross-linguistic study by Seymour, Aro, and Erskine (2003), 13 European alphabetic languages were compared. The age at which children enter primary school in different countries did not influence reading acquisition. Nor did the gender of the child. In most languages studied, children became accurate and fluent readers by the end of first grade, but for some Germanic languages, such as Danish and particularly English, the rate of learning to read was more than twice as slow. The delayed wordreading skill was mainly attributed to the complexity of the syllabic structure and the inconsistent system of grapheme–phoneme correspondences. If phonology and orthography influence the rate of learning to read words, studies on English do not apply universally to all children (for oral-language learning, see Vihman, 1996)."

Structural equation modeling of continuity suggested effects from growth in early vocabulary to mastery of inflectional forms at preschool age. The early language directly influenced early phonological awareness (PA) and only indirectly influenced later development in PA and word reading. The course of development in PA progressed from detecting larger multiphonemic units toward recognizing and producing phonemes in words, which, in turn, were positively associated with differences in producing new words by deleting and blending phonemes at kindergarten age. Including word reading before school entry levelled out the influence of the concurrent phonemic awareness factor on reading at first grade. Hence, in a highly inflected language with a transparent orthography, the pathway to reading consisted of skills learned in succession, the last phase being characterized by simultaneous development involving phonemic awareness and emerging reading skill. The finding led to the conclusion that, in addition to universal routes, language- and culture-specific routes to literacy must be acknowledged when searching for the precursors to reading at school age."

Study 1 found that evaluations of a complex social relationship were accompanied not only by supportive interpretations of the ambiguous facts, but also by concordant hot cognitions. Studies 2 through 4 included manipulations to demonstrate the spreading of coherence from cold to hot cognitions and in the opposite direction. We observed these effects following a manipulation of the facts (Study 2), a manipulation of participants’ emotions toward the actor (Study 3), and a manipulation of participants’ motivation toward the outcome of the case (Study 4).

Kindergarten students were assigned to two groups: those who showed mastery of skills that are important predictors of proficient reading (Low Risk group--LR) and those who initially did not show mastery, but later benefited from systematic reading instruction and developed average-range reading skills at the end of Grade 1 (High Risk Responders--HR-R). Spatiotemporal profiles of brain activity were obtained during performance of letter-sound and pseudoword naming tasks before and after Grade 1 instruction. With few exceptions, LR children showed early development of brain activation profiles that are typical of older skilled readers. Provided that temporoparietal and visual association areas were recruited into the brain mechanism that supported reading, the majority of HR-R children benefited from systematic reading instruction and developed adequate reading abilities. Reading is a relatively late achievement in the course of human development. It is built upon naturally occurring human capabilities for oral language, but also depends on skills that do not appear to be directly related to those normally involved in spoken language processing, such as phonological awareness (Blachman, 1997; Liberman, 1998; Lukatela & Turvey, 1998), visual discrimination of graphemic features (Eden, VanMeter, Rumsey, & Zeffiro, 1996), and other processes supporting word recognition. From the study of reading deficits caused by brain lesions (e.g., Black & Behrmann, 1994; Damasio & Damasio, 1983; Henderson, 1986) and more recently from functional brain imaging studies (reviewed in Fiez & Petersen, 1998; Pugh et al., 2000) it has become apparent that reading, including word recognition, requires a highly integrated network of closely interconnected brain areas, the majority of which reside in the left cerebral hemisphere. This network or “mechanism” presumably includes separate circuits, each composed of distinct neurophysiological processes that take place in one or more brain regions. A recently proposed model (see for instance Logan, 1997) postulates two posterior brain circuits. One is a dorsal circuit comprising the temporoparietal region (roughly corresponding to Wernicke's area) and the angular gyrus, and is mainly involved in phonological analysis and in establishing associations between"

The paper is informed by poststructuralist theory as the participant/observers are observed. According to the paper, a poststructuralist reading of the work demands a critical stance of the researchers' thinking as researchers acknowledging that the research is constituted as much by the researcher's positionality as the research participants. The paper states that there is a double focus to the analysis: first, discussion centers on the experience of the kindergartners; and second, the focus changes to the teacher/researcher. It aims to present an analysis of the shifting multiple discursive practices evident in the classroom during a series of drama lessons. The paper's research study involved investigating if drama work could support the students in developing a critical response to some picture books, that is, if they could consider the literary texts in ways that were beyond a literal response. Stating that it is not possible to assume a position ""outside"" of the research process as the self is implied in the research process, the paper suggests that researchers may more beneficially behave as if research constructs multiple ways of seeing differently.

On the basis of a multilevel path analysis, we found that phonological and semantic skills predict each arithmetic component differently and independently. Phonological skills displayed a direct effect on computation and an indirect effect on word problems, mediated by computation.

Although some researchers have reported increased solution rates after an incubation period (i.e., a period of time in which a problem is set aside prior to further attempts to solve), others have failed to find effects. The analysis examined the contributions of moderators such as problem type, presence of solution-relevant or misleading cues, and lengths of preparation and incubation periods to incubation effect sizes. The authors identified a positive incubation effect, with divergent thinking tasks benefiting more than linguistic and visual insight tasks from incubation. Longer preparation periods gave a greater incubation effect, whereas filling an incubation period with high cognitive demand tasks gave a smaller incubation effect. Surprisingly, low cognitive demand tasks yielded a stronger incubation effect than did rest during an incubation period when solving linguistic insight problems. The existence of multiple types of incubation effect provides evidence for differential invocation of knowledge-based vs. strategic solution processes across different classes of problem, and it suggests that the conditions under which incubation can be used as a practical technique for enhancing problem solving must be designed with care."

Using a longitudinal design, we found that prompting self-regulation throughout training increased learning and reduced attrition, relative to the control condition. Moreover, the effect on learning was fully mediated by time on task. The intervention also moderated the effect of learning on subsequent self-regulatory activity and attrition. Learning performance had less of a positive effect on subsequent self-regulatory activity and less of a negative effect on subsequent attrition when trainees were prompted to self-regulate.

Specifically, children with poor reading skills resemble biologically younger children with respect to their auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to speech stimulation. Because ABR development continues into adolescence, it is possible that the link between ABRs and reading ability changes or resolves as the brainstem matures. To examine these possibilities, ABRs were recorded at varying presentation rates in adults with diverse, yet unimpaired reading levels. We found that reading ability in adulthood related to ABR Wave V latency, with more juvenile response morphology linked to less proficient reading ability, as has been observed for children.

The current work, however, demonstrates that this aspect of secrecy is rather rare. Taking a broader view of secrecy as the intent to conceal information, which only sometimes necessitates concealment, yields a new psychology of secrecy. Ten studies demonstrate the secrets people have, what it is like to have a secret, and what about secrecy is related to lower well-being. We demonstrate that people catch themselves spontaneously thinking about their secrets—they mind-wander to them—far more frequently than they encounter social situations that require active concealment of those secrets. Moreover, independent of concealment frequency, the frequency of mind-wandering to secrets predicts lower well-being (whereas the converse was not the case). We explore the diversity of secrets people have and the harmful effects of spontaneously thinking about those secrets in both recall tasks and in longitudinal designs, analyzing more than 13,000 secrets across our participant samples, with outcomes for relationship satisfaction, authenticity, well-being, and physical health.

The hypothesis that explanation availability mediates belief change in response to causal arguments was tested in 2 experiments. Persuasive communications used causal evidence, noncausal (statistical) evidence, or both to argue that AIDS is not transmissible by casual contact. Results supported the authors' hypothesis. Causal arguments produced the greatest belief change, with the effect mediated by explanation availability. Causal arguments were also less subject to evaluation bias, consistent with a cognitive interpretation of the biased assimilation phenomenon (in which evidence in favor of one's position is evaluated more favorably than evidence in opposition). Experiment 2 replicated the basic effects with dependent measures (including a measure of behavioral commitment) obtained 3 weeks after presentation of the communications. These results suggest that a causal component strengthens the educational potential of persuasive arguments. Persuading an audience to accept new information seems particularly difficult when audience members can explain why they hold their current beliefs. The persuasion task then goes beyond simply convincing an audience of the correctness of the new information; persuasion must also overcome forces that maintain established beliefs. For example, in teaching social psychology, we have seen students resist ideas that challenge their common sense understanding of social behavior. Of course, common sense is derived from life experience and is rich with explanations. Researchers studying learning in children have observed a similar phenomenon.

Differences between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls in stimulus perception, selective attention, alertness, processing speed and reaction time variability may have been previously overlooked. By controlling for these potential confounders, the present experiments were aimed to be more rigorous tests of the hypothesis that psychosis and schizophrenia are associated with impairments of conflict control. To that end, 27 healthy controls and 53 recent-onset psychosis patients with (n = 27) and without schizophrenia (n = 26) with comparable age, intelligence, and education level, performed three iconic conflict control tasks: the Simon task, the Eriksen flanker task, and the Stroop task, all equipped with neutral trials, and analyzed for various potential confounders. They further performed a battery of standard neuropsychological tests. Schizophrenia patients showed no increased conflict effects in any of the 3 tasks for any alternative measures used. Nonschizophrenia patients only showed abnormally increased response competition in the Simon task. All patients nevertheless demonstrated impaired control of attention and verbal memory. These findings indicate that the type of conflict control engaged by conflict tasks is intact in recent-onset schizophrenia, suggesting that a major component of executive function is spared in schizophrenia.

Humans and 1 of 2 monkeys were able to make cognitive, decisional uncertainty responses that were independent of feedback or reinforcement history within a task.

Concurrent memory tasks were occasionally overlain on ongoing discrimination performance. The concurrent tasks disrupted macaques’ uncertainty responses far more than their sparse, middle, or dense discrimination responses.

Method: Thirty-seven adult survivors of childhood brain tumor and typically developing adults participated (age M=24.19±4.51 years, 62% female).

Results: Fractional anisotropy values (FA) of the PT-OT tract were significantly correlated with word reading in survivors and controls (r=.45, .58, respectively; p<.05) while IFOF values were associated with reading in survivors only (r=.59, p<.01). Further, the moderated mediated model was significant for PT-OT and IFOF, such that the indirect effect of processing speed was only present for survivors (CI: PT-OT: 2.90, 28.41, IFOF: 2.92, 40.17).

Facial movements were analyzed with the Facial Action Coding System ( P. E. Ekman & W. V. Friesen, 1978). While watching happy stimuli, the 10 DS adults who were able to appropriately rate their reactions smiled with a cheek raise as frequently as control adults, suggesting that the expression of positive affect in these individuals is normal. Contrary to predictions, however, the DS group exhibited fewer smiles without cheek raises than did control adults and were more likely not to smile. Neither group showed prototypic sad facial expressions in response to sad stimuli. Independent of emotion, DS participants made more facial movements, including more tongue shows, than did control participants. Differences in facial expression in DS adults may confuse others' interpretations of their emotional responses and may be important for understanding the development of abnormal emotional processes."

Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that 2 semantically related nouns produce interference effects either when they are in the same or different phrases of a sentence. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrate that 2 phonologically related nouns produce facilitation effects but only when they are within the same phrase of a sentence. The results argue against strictly serial models of multiple-word access and provide evidence of a flow of semantic and phonological information between words during sentence production.

PA has a long history of documented success achieving these aims, making it an Evidence Based Practice (EBP). Intervention research on EBP's has established the importance of implementation fidelity, especially with regard to program dosage; failure to properly implement an EBP can have negative consequences on targeted outcomes, especially if participants are exposed to a low dosage of the program (e.g., fewer lessons than specified). Much of the current research on PA has neglected to examine how program dosage impacts PA's effect on targeted outcomes. Using propensity score models, multiple imputation, and a 2-level hierarchical linear model, the current study fills this gap and examines how different dosages of PA as measured by years participating in PA and number of PA lessons, impacts adolescent internalizing symptoms, aggression, perceptions of school hassles, and self-esteem over a 3-year period. The current sample included middle school students in grades 6, 7, and 8 (N = 5,894). The findings indicate that students who received 3 years of the PA intervention and a high number of PA lessons had a significantly higher self-esteem score than those who received 0 years of PA or zero lessons.

A significant difference in increased non-verbal IQ scores between the active supplement and placebo groups was found, but no difference in verbal IQ scores between the two groups was demonstrated. An analysis of the errors and omissions made in the IQ tests indicates that the error rate for the supplemented group remained stable over the 10 weeks but that the number of omissions dropped significantly. Almost all the omissions made by the children in the first IQ test were at the end of the paper when the children ran out of time and so were unable to finish the paper. After 10 weeks of supplementation, however, considerably more non-verbal IQ questions were completed and since the error rate remained the same this resulted in significant gains in non-verbal IQ. These data suggest that speed of processing is a significant factor in IQ performance and presumably in intelligence. In the light of this analysis no increase in verbal IQ scores could have been expected since almost all children completed all the questions on the first verbal IQ test paper. There was simply no room for improvement in verbal IQ to occur."

There was no significant indirect effect of speech perception on reading via phoneme awareness, suggesting that its effects are separable from those of phoneme awareness. Children classified with dyslexia at 8 years had poorer speech perception than age-controls at 5½ years and children with language disorders (with or without dyslexia) had more severe difficulties with both speech perception and attention control.

This article examines the strategies that people use to revise their quantitative estimates on the basis of the estimates of another person. The authors note that people tend to use 2 basic strategies when revising estimates: choosing between the 2 estimates and averaging them. The authors developed the probability, accuracy, redundancy (PAR) model to examine the relative effectiveness of these two strategies across judgment environments. A surprising result was that averaging was the more effective strategy across a wide range of commonly encountered environments. The authors observed that despite this finding, people tend to favor the choosing strategy. Most participants in these studies would have achieved greater accuracy had they always averaged. The identification of intuitive strategies, along with a formal analysis of when they are accurate, provides a basis for examining how effectively people use the judgments of others. Although a portfolio of strategies that includes averaging and choosing can be highly effective, the authors argue that people are not generally well adapted to the environment in terms of strategy selection."

Only vocabulary size significantly contributed to the reading scores, emphasizing the importance of the number of words known for reading comprehension.

Children were read scenarios in which a teacher determined outcomes for 2 students (1 boy and 1 girl). Contextual information (i.e., teacher’s past behavior), the gender of the target of discrimination (i.e., student), and the gender of the perpetrator (i.e., teacher) were manipulated. Results indicated that older children were more likely than younger children to make attributions to discrimination when contextual information suggested that it was likely. Girls (but not boys) were more likely to view girls than boys as victims of discrimination, and children with egalitarian gender attitudes were more likely to perceive discrimination than were their peers. Discrimination on the basis of group membership (e.g., gender, race, or religion) is an important social problem in the United States and throughout the world. In the year 2000, for example, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights received approximately 5,000 complaints regarding instances of discrimination. The majority of these complaints (approximately 70%) were filed on behalf of elementary and secondary school children. Undoubtedly, many more instances of discrimination affecting children occur every year but go unreported. Although existing research has examined factors that affect adults’ perceptions of discrimination (e.g., Swim, Cohen, & Hyers, 1998), little research has examined children’s perceptions of discrimination. In this study, we examined children’s judgments about scenarios involving possible instances of gender discrimination. We were especially interested in whether children are sensitive to contextual information in making attributions to discrimination and whether individual and developmental differences among children are related to their perceptions of discrimination. In addition to its obvious practical importance, understanding how and when children perceive discrimination is important for developmental theory.

These children are underrepresented in the screening literature and are likely a more heterogeneous group of poor readers compared to younger students. Deficits may be broader and could include those associated with younger poor readers (e.g., decoding, word recognition, word reading fluency, spelling) as well as comprehension, vocabulary, and oral language (Cain, Oakhill, & Lemmon, 2004; Catts, Adlof, & Weismer, 2006). The possibility that the reading skills of these children vary on a number of dimensions requires careful attention to the predictor variables selected for screening, the criterion variables used to define reading problems, and the methodological procedures used in both phases of a screening paradigm."

Targets and cues appeared on the left or right of Ss' midline. Localization of the target in orthogonal directions (up vs. down or front vs. back, independent of target side) was faster when cue and target appeared on the same rather than opposite sides. This benefit was larger and more durable when the cue predicted target side. These effects cannot reflect criterion shifts, suggesting that covert orienting enhances auditory localization. Fine frequency discriminations also benefited from predictive spatial cues, although uninformative cues only affected spatial discriminations. No cuing effects were observed in a detection task"

We addressed the question of whether behaviors in school have any long-lasting effects for one‘s later life. Specifically, we investigated the role of being a responsible student, interest in school, writing skills, and reading skills in predicting educational attainment, occupational prestige, and income 11 years (N = 81,912) and 50 years (N = 1,952) after high school. We controlled for parental socioeconomic status, IQ, and broad personality traits in all analyses. We found that student characteristics and behaviors in adolescence predicted later educational and occupational success above and beyond parental socioeconomic status, IQ, and broad personality traits. Having higher interest in school was related to higher educational attainment at years 11 and 50, higher occupational prestige at year 11, and higher income at year 50. Higher levels of being a responsible student were related to higher educational attainment and higher occupational prestige at years 11 and 50. This was the first longitudinal study to test the role of student characteristics and behaviors over and above broad personality traits. It highlights the potential importance of what students do in school and how they react to their experiences during that time. It also highlights the possibility that things that happen in specific periods of one’s life may play out in ways far more significant than we expect.

All dyslexics with no comorbidity problem schooled in a special institution for children with severe reading deficits were included in the study (N = 15; Chronological Age [CA]: 111 ± 8 months; RL: 80 ± 3 months). For the group study, the 15 dyslexics were matched pairwise on reading level, non-verbal IQ, and gender to 15 younger RL controls (CA: 85 ± 4 months). For the multiple-case study, the RL control group included 86 average readers (CA: 83 ± 4 months; RL: 85 ± 5 months). To assess the relative efficiency of the sublexical (or phonological) and lexical reading procedures, we relied on two comparisons: pseudowords vs. high-frequency regular words (the comparison mainly used in languages with a shallow orthography); and pseudowords vs. high-frequency irregular words (the comparison mainly used with English-speaking dyslexics), pseudowords and irregular words being either short or long. The dyslexics’ skills in the domains supposed to explain their reading deficit were also examined: phonemic awareness, phonological short-term memory and rapid naming. In the group study, the dyslexics lagged behind the RL controls only when they were required to read long pseudowords. The results of the multiple-case study indicated that the prevalence of this deficit was high (the accuracy scores of all but two of the 15 dyslexics being more than 1 SD below the RL control mean), and that deficits in phonemic awareness were more prevalent (seven cases) than deficits in phonological memory (one case) and in rapid naming (two cases). Three unexpected results were observed in the group study: the difference between regular words and pseudowords (to the detriment of pseudowords) was not greater for the dyslexics; the difference between irregular words and pseudowords (to the benefit of pseudowords) was more significant for the RL controls; and there were no significant differences between the groups in reading-related skills. To explain these results, the severity of the dyslexics’ reading deficit and the remediation they have benefited from must be taken into account. In addition, the fact that the outcomes of the comparison between pseudoword vs. regular or irregular word reading were not the same will make it possible to understand some discrepancies between studies carried out either in English or in a language with a shallower orthography (French, for instance)."

In addition, the digit-naming test accounted for all of the power of the nonrhyming memory test to discriminate between reading-disability and normal children. Based on these results, it was hypothesized that digit-naming speed is a measure of the ability to engage in high-speed phonetic coding, that this ability is impaired in poor readers, and that this impairment affects short-term memory span. Possible explanations of the relevance of phonetic coding speed to reading ability and to short-term serial memory are discussed."

The biological view of the Five-factor theory proposes the plaster hypothesis: All personality traits stop changing by age 30. In contrast, contextualist perspectives propose that changes should be more varied and should persist throughout adulthood. This study compared these perspectives in a large (N 132,515) sample of adults aged 21– 60 who completed a Big Five personality measure on the Internet. Conscientiousness and Agreeableness increased throughout early and middle adulthood at varying rates; Neuroticism declined among women but did not change among men. The variety in patterns of change suggests that the Big Five traits are complex phenomena subject to a variety of developmental influences. How does personality change during adulthood? Psychologists since William James (1890/1950) have struggled with the question of whether various aspects of personality, including personality traits, change in meaningful ways during adulthood, and when those changes take place. Contemporary hypotheses about the development of personality traits stem from theories about what personality traits are. McCrae and Costa’s (1996) five-factor theory asserts that personality traits arise exclusively from biological causes (i.e., genes) and that they reach full maturity in early adulthood; thus, this theory predicts little or no change on any personality dimension after early adulthood. By contrast, contextualist perspectives argue that traits are multiply determined, and that one important influence on traits is the individual’s social environment (Haan, Millsap, & Hartka, 1986; Helson, Jones, & Kwan, 2002). Contextualist perspectives thus predict plasticity: Change is complex and ongoing, owing to the many factors that can affect personality traits. In this study, we set out to understand how personality traits change in early and middle adulthood by examining the Big Five personality trait dimensions (Goldberg, 1992; John & Srivastava, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 1999). We used a cross-sectional design to study how mean levels of personality traits differ by age and whether those age effects are moderated by gender. 1 We were particularly interested in examining whether change on all of the Big Five dimensions stops or slows in middle adulthood, as predicted by the five-factor theory, or whether change is ongoing and differentiated, as predicted by contextualist theories."

In 2 experiments, 1 on adolescents (N 59) and 1 on children (N 57), no empirical evidence was obtained for impaired Hebb learning in dyslexics, whether the same data-analytical procedure as Szmalec et al. was used or whether some methodological improvements were applied (e.g., using a more sensitive index of Hebb learning, and equating groups on filler performance with state trace analysis). In an additional state trace analysis, aggregating data over participants, it was shown that performance on the repeated Hebb sequences was almost perfectly predictable from performance on the nonrepeated sequences (fillers). The implications of these findings are outlined for the current discussion on the mechanisms for encoding immediate serial recall and long-term sequence learning and for computational models attempting to simulate these mechanisms."

The major categories linked to coping with the situation were avoidance, isolation, normalization, caregiving, and grieving. A third major theme consisted of a fear of possible schizophrenia heredity.

START,START,2019959754,the effects of alcohol emotion regulation and emotional arousal on the dating aggression intentions of men and women,2014,"cynthia a stappenbeck, kim fromme",psychology of addictive behaviors,1,20,0,"Verbal and physical dating aggression is prevalent among college-aged men and women, especially a pattern of mutual aggression in which both partners engage in aggression. Alcohol intoxication and anger arousal have been implicated in the occurrence of aggression, and the ability to regulate one's emotions may interact with both alcohol intoxication and emotional arousal to predict dating aggression. The current study is the first known experimental investigation to examine the effects of alcohol intoxication, alcohol expectancies, emotion regulation, and emotional arousal on dating aggression. Participants were randomized to receive alcohol (n = 48), placebo (n = 48), or no alcohol (n = 48). Intoxicated men and women expressed more verbal and physical aggression intentions than those in the no-alcohol condition, and individuals in the placebo condition did not significantly differ from those in the alcohol and no-alcohol conditions. These results suggest that the pharmacological effects of alcohol were important to the occurrence of dating aggression, whereas the effects of expectancy are less clear. Among those less able to engage in cognitive reappraisal, individuals who consumed or believed they consumed alcohol expressed more verbal and physical aggression intentions than those who received no alcohol. Those with higher arousal who were better able to suppress their emotions expressed fewer verbal and physical aggression intentions than those with lower arousal. In addition to reducing alcohol consumption, interventions for dating aggression might incorporate emotion regulation skills, with a focus on understanding the circumstances in which cognitive reappraisal and emotion suppression are relatively more effective.

In 2 of the experiments, the repetition effect for nonwords was reliably above chance even when there was a failure to recognize the stimulus. The authors propose a parallel distributed processing (PDP) model based on the work of J. McClelland and D. Rumelhart (1985) as a way to understand the mechanisms potentially responsible for the pattern of findings. Although the error-driven nature of learning in the model results in a poor fit to the nonword priming data, this is not endemic to all PDP models. Using a model based on Hebbian learning, the authors instantiate a property that they believe is characteristic of implicit memory-that learning is primarily based on the strengthening of connections between units that become active during the processing of a stimulus. This model provides a far more satisfactory account of the data than does the error-driven model."

In the critical conditions of the first 2 experiments, a high- or low-frequency verb was used to disambiguate a garden-path sentence, while in the last experiment, a high- or low-frequency verb constituted a phrase structure violation. The frequency manipulation always influenced the early eye movement measures of first-fixation duration and gaze duration. The context manipulation had a delayed effect in Experiment 1, influencing only the probability of a regressive eye movement from later in the sentence. However, the context manipulation influenced the same early eye movement measures as the frequency effect in Experiments 2 and 3, though there was no statistical interaction between the effects of these variables. The context manipulation also influenced the probability of a regressive eye movement from the verb, though the frequency manipulation did not. These results are shown to confirm predictions emerging from the serial, staged architecture for lexical and integrative processing of the E–Z Reader 10 model of eye movement control in reading (Reichle, Warren, & McConnell, 2009).

Crossed random effects models were used to explore child- and item-level predictors related to number of exposures to mastery, posttest word reading performance, and maintenance performance after 1 week. Results from Experiment 1 indicate that imageability plays a role in irregular word learning. Results from Experiment 2 suggest that students who received imageability training required fewer exposures to reach mastery. There was a significant interaction between initial word reading skill and condition, with students with low word reading skills requiring fewer exposures for mastery if they were in the imageability condition. Overall, these findings suggest that word imageability significantly affects both word reading accuracy and rate of word learning."

We distinguish between 2 subtypes of children with word reading RD, those with early emerging and late-emerging RD, and 2 types of irregular words, “exception” and “strange.” Predictors representing child-level and word-level characteristics, along with selected interactions between child- and word-characteristics, were used to predict item-level variance. Individual differences in irregular word reading were predicted at the child level by nonword decoding, orthographic coding, and vocabulary; at the word level by word frequency and a spelling-to-pronunciation transparency rating; and by the Reader group × Imageability and Reader group × Irregular word type interactions. Results are interpreted within a model of irregular word reading in which lexical characteristics specific to both child and word influence accuracy.

This study examines the stability of these groups from kindergarten to second grade. An initial sample of 214 students were tested at four time points on measures of rapid automatized naming, phonological awareness, and reading.

Yet, little is known about how this effect varies through adulthood as a function of reading skill. In this study, Participants 18–64 years old with a range of literacy competence read simple sentences as their eye movements were monitored. We manipulated the predictability of a sentence-final target word, operationalized as cloze probability. First fixation durations showed an interaction between age and literacy skill, decreasing with age among more skilled readers but increasing among less skilled readers. This pattern suggests that age-related slowing may impact reading when not buffered by skill, but with continued practice, automatization of reading can continue to develop in adulthood. In absolute terms, readers were sensitive to predictability, regardless of age or literacy, in both early and later measures. Older readers showed differential contextual sensitivity in regression patterns, effects not moderated by literacy skill. Finally, comprehension performance increased with age and literacy skill, but performance among less skilled readers was especially reduced when predictability was low, suggesting that low-literacy adults (regardless of age) struggle when creating mental representations under weaker semantic constraints. Collectively, these findings suggest that aging readers (regardless of reading skill) are more sensitive to context for meaning-integration processes; that less skilled adult readers (regardless of age) depend more on a constrained semantic representation for comprehension; and that the capacity for literacy engagement enables continued development of efficient lexical processing in adult reading development."

Meta-analyses and literature reviews have shown that the beneficial effects of exposure are robust and gains are maintained or improved over time (e.g., Choy, Fyer, & Lipsitz, 2007; Wolitzky-Taylor, Horowitz, Powers, & Telch, 2008). Despite the well-documented success of exposure therapy, many phobic individuals do not improve, or find confronting their feared stimuli aversive, and consequently drop out of or avoid treatment (e.g., Choy et al.). In fact, data from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study showed that approximately 70% of people with diagnosable phobias had not sought treatment, and of those who had, less than 50% sought services specific to psychological health (see Wolitzky-Taylor et al. for review). Given these limitations, there is a clear need to explore alternate approaches to phobia treatment.

The current study evaluates a new approach to the treatment of phobias: cognitive bias modification for interpretations (CBM-I) for individuals with extreme height fear. To examine the utility of modifying interpretation biases, height fear and related symptoms were measured before and after two sessions of CBM-I, and compared to an Exposure Only condition, a combination of CBM-I and exposure therapy (labeled CBM-I+Exposure), and a Control condition."

We found that people readily use information about another’s morality when judging their competence, despite holding folk intuitions that these domains are independent. Across 6 studies (n = 1,567), including 2 preregistered experiments, participants judged targets who committed hypothetical transgressions (Studies 1 and 3), cheated on lab tasks (Study 2), acted selfishly in economic games (Study 4), and received low morality ratings from coworkers (Study 5 and 6) as less competent than control or moral targets. These findings were specific to morality and were not the result of incidentally manipulating impressions of warmth (Study 4), nor were they fully explained by a general halo effect (Studies 2 and 3). We hypothesized that immoral targets are seen as less competent because their immoral actions led them to be viewed as low in social intelligence. Studies 4 and 5 supported this prediction, demonstrating that social intelligence was a more reliable mediator than perceptions of self-control or general intelligence. An experimental test of this mediation argument found that presenting targets as highly socially intelligent eliminated the negative effect of immoral information on judgments of competence (Study 6). These results suggest that information about a person’s moral character readily influences perceptions of their competence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"

Optimal performance depends on using information available at many time scales, from the near instantaneous values of variables underlying perception (i.e., detection), to longer term information about appropriate scaling (i.e., calibration), to yet longer term information guiding variable use (i.e., attunement). Fractal fluctuations in explorations would entail fluctuation at all time scales, allowing perceptual systems a flexible way to detect information at all time scales. We tested whether perceptual learning in dynamic touch is related to the fractality of wielding behaviors. A reanalysis of wielding behaviors from Arzamarski, Isenhower, Kay, Turvey, and Michaels (2010) revealed that exploratory movements were fractal and that a fractal-scaling exponent predicts individual differences in haptic judgments."

Self-organization from the theory of nonlinear dynamics offers an account of this remarkable phenomenon. Two studies provide an initial test of the hypothesis that the emergence of new cognitive structure follows the same universal principles as emergence in other domains (e.g., fluids, lasers). In both studies, participants initially solved gear-system problems by manually tracing the force across a system of gears. Subsequently, they discovered that the gears form an alternating sequence, thereby demonstrating a new cognitive structure. In both studies, dynamical analyses of action during problem solving predicted the spontaneous emergence of the new cognitive structure. Study 1 showed that a peak in entropy, followed by negentropy, key indicators of self-organization, predicted discovery of alternation. Study 2 replicated these effects, and showed that increasing environmental entropy accelerated discovery, a classic prediction from dynamics. Additional analyses based on the relationship between phase transitions and power-law behavior provide converging evidence. The studies provide an initial demonstration of the emergence of cognitive structure through self-organization."

We contrasted these two models of cognitive enrichment by randomly assigning healthy older adults to a home-based inductive reasoning training program, a team-based competitive program in creative problem solving, or to a wait-list control. As predicted, those in the training condition showed selective improvement in inductive reasoning. Those in the engagement condition, on the other hand, showed selective improvement in divergent thinking, a key ability exercised in creative problem solving. On average, then, both groups appeared to show ability-specific effects. However, moderators of change differed somewhat for those in the engagement and training interventions. Generally, those who started either intervention with a more positive cognitive profile showed more cognitive growth, suggesting that cognitive resources enabled individuals to take advantage of environmental enrichment. Only in the engagement condition did initial levels of openness and social network size moderate intervention effects on cognition, suggesting that comfort with novelty and an ability to manage social resources may be additional factors contributing to the capacity to take advantage of the environmental complexity associated with engagement. Collectively, these findings suggest that training and engagement models may offer alternative routes to cognitive resilience in late life."

In event-related potential (ERP) work using the same materials, Lee and Federmeier (2009, 2011) found that young adults elicited a sustained frontal negativity to NV homographs when only syntactic cues were available (i.e., in syntactic prose); this effect was eliminated by semantic constraints. The negativity was only present in older adults with high verbal fluency. The current study shows parallel findings: Young adults exhibit inflated first fixation durations to NV homographs in syntactic prose, but not semantically congruent sentences. This effect is absent in older adults as a group. Verbal fluency modulates the effect in both age groups: High fluency is associated with larger first fixation effects in syntactic prose. Older, but not younger, adults also show significantly increased rereading of the NV homographs in syntactic prose. Verbal fluency modulates this effect as well: High fluency is associated with a reduced tendency to reread, regardless of age. This relationship suggests a trade-off between initial and downstream processing costs for ambiguity during natural reading. Together the eye-tracking and ERP data suggest that effortful meaning selection recruits mechanisms important for suppressing contextually inappropriate meanings, which also slow eye movements. Efficacy of frontotemporal circuitry, as captured by verbal fluency, predicts the success of engaging these mechanisms in both young and older adults. Failure to recruit these processes requires compensatory rereading or leads to comprehension failures (Lee & Federmeier, 2012)."

Less restrictive constraints (Experiments 1 and 2) produced higher variability during the constraints. More restrictive constraints (Experiments 2 and 3) led to higher variability after the constraints were relaxed.

In two experiments, we present evidence that false beliefs about one's own prior attitudes and confabulatory reasoning can lead to lasting changes in political attitudes. In Experiment 1 (N = 140), participants stated their opinions about salient political issues, and using the Choice Blindness Paradigm we covertly altered some of their responses to indicate an opposite position. In the first condition, we asked the participants to immediately verify the manipulated responses, and in the second, we also asked them to provide underlying arguments behind their attitudes. Only half of the manipulations were corrected by the participants. To measure lasting attitude change, we asked the participants to rate the same issues again later in the experiment, as well as one week after the first session. Participants in both conditions exhibited lasting shifts in attitudes, but the effect was considerably larger in the group that confabulated supporting arguments. We fully replicated these findings in Experiment 2 (N = 232). In addition, we found that participants' analytical skill correlated with their correction of the manipulation, whereas political involvement did not. This study contributes to the understanding of how confabulatory reasoning and self-perceptive processes can interact in lasting attitude change.

Extending Camilli et al. (2003, 2006), the largest effects are associated with reading instruction enhanced with components that increase comprehensiveness and intensity. In contrast to Hammill and Swanson, binomial effect size displays show that effect sizes of the magnitude found for systematic phonics by the NRP are meaningful and could result in significant improvement for many students depending on the base rate of struggling readers and the size of the effect. Camilli et al. (2003, 2006) and Hammill and Swanson do not contradict the NRP report, concurring in supporting comprehensive approaches to reading instruction."

Thus far, it is still unclear whether Chinese children with dyslexia show similar disruption of white matter pathways as in alphabetic languages. The present study focused on the alteration of white matter pathways in Chinese children with dyslexia. Using diffusion tensor imaging tractography, the bilateral arcuate fasciculus (AF-anterior, AF-posterior and AF-direct segments), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) were delineated in each individual’s native space. Compared with age-matched controls, Chinese children with dyslexia showed reduced fractional anisotropy in the left AF-direct and the left ILF. Further regression analyses revealed a functional dissociation between the left AF-direct and the left ILF. The AF-direct tract integrity was associated with phonological processing skill, an ability important for reading in all writing systems, while the ILF integrity was associated with morphological processing skill, an ability more strongly recruited for Chinese reading. In conclusion, the double disruption locus in Chinese children with dyslexia, and the functional dissociation between dorsal and ventral pathways reflect both universal and specific properties of reading in Chinese."

Children begin to develop fluency when they are able to form orthographic representations of words, which provide direct, smooth, and fast reading. Dyslexic children of transparent orthographic systems are mainly characterized by poor reading fluency (Cuetos & Suarez-Coalla 2009; Spinelli, De Luca, Di Filippo, Mancini, Martelli, & Zoccolotti, 2005; Wimmer, 1993). Therefore, the main problem for these children could be the difficulty in developing orthographic representations of the words they read. The aim of this study was to test the ability of dyslexic Spanish-speaking children (whose native language is Spanish) to develop orthographic representations and determine if the context helps them. For this, two experiments were conducted with a group of 100 children, 7–12 years of age. The groups were comprised of 20 dyslexics, 40 chronological age-matched controls and 40 reading level-matched controls. In the first experiment, eight unfamiliar words (four short and four long) were presented six times within the context of a story. In the second experiment, eight pseudowords were presented on a computer and the children had to read them aloud. In both experiments, the reading and articulation times of experimental and control stimuli were compared, before and after the training. Children without dyslexia showed a decrease of the influence of length of word on reading speed, indicating a lexical reading, while for dyslexic children, the influence of length remained unchanged. These results appeared when the stimuli were presented in the context of a story as well as when presented in isolation. In short, our results describe that dyslexic children of transparent orthographic systems have problems in developing orthographic representations of words."

This situation has led to increased efforts to unravel the cognitive mechanisms underlying deception and to develop a comprehensive theory of deception. A cognitive approach to deception has reinvigorated interest in reaction time (RT) measures to differentiate lies from truths and to investigate whether lying is more cognitively demanding than truth telling. Here, we provide the results of a meta-analysis of 114 studies (n = 3307) using computerized RT paradigms to assess the cognitive cost of lying. Results revealed a large standardized RT difference, even after correction for publication bias (d = 1.049; 95% CI [0.930; 1.169]), with a large heterogeneity amongst effect sizes. Moderator analyses revealed that the RT deception effect was smaller, yet still large, in studies in which participants received instructions to avoid detection. The autobiographical Implicit Association Test produced smaller effects than the Concealed Information Test, the Sheffield Lie Test, and the Differentiation of Deception paradigm. An additional meta-analysis (17 studies, n = 348) showed that, like other deception measures, RT deception measures are susceptible to countermeasures. Whereas our meta-analysis corroborates current cognitive approaches to deception, the observed heterogeneity calls for further research on the boundary conditions of the cognitive cost of deception. RT-based measures of deception may have potential in applied settings, but countermeasures remain an important challenge."

These objections can be illuminated by relevant psychological theory and research.

One widespread account of suffering is a repressive suffering construal (RSC): interpreting suffering as occurring because people deviate from social norms and as having the purpose of reinforcing the social order. Based on the theorizing of Emile Durkheim and others, we propose that RSC is associated with social morality—the belief that society dictates morality—and is encouraged by collectivist (as opposed to individualist) sentiments. Study 1 showed that dispositional collectivism predicts both social morality and RSC. Studies 2–4 showed that priming collectivist (vs. individualist) self-construal increases RSC of various types of suffering and that this effect is mediated by increased social morality (Study 4). Study 5 examined behavioral intentions, demonstrating that parents primed with a collectivist self-construal interpreted children’s suffering more repressively and showed greater support for corporal punishment of children."

On the basis of E. Becker’s (1969) existential theorizing, the authors argue that people attribute exaggerated influence to enemies as a means of compensating for perceptions of reduced control over their environment. In Study 1, individuals dispositionally low in perceived control responded to a reminder of external hazards by attributing more influence to a personal enemy. In Study 2, a situational threat to control over external hazard strengthened participants’ belief in the conspiratorial power of a political enemy. Examining moderators and outcomes of this process, Study 3 showed that participants were especially likely to attribute influence over life events to an enemy when the broader social system appeared disordered, and Study 4 showed that perceiving an ambiguously powerful enemy under conditions of control threat decreased perceptions of external risk and bolstered feelings of personal control."

We assessed whether participants assign stress following distributional information such as stress neighborhood (the proportion and number of existent words sharing orthographic ending and stress pattern) and whether such distributional information affects naming speed. Experiments 1 and 2 tested how readers assign stress to pseudowords. The results showed that participants assign stress on the basis of the pseudowords’ stress neighborhood, but only when this orthographic/phonological information is widely represented in the lexicon. Experiments 3 and 4 tested the naming speed of pseudowords with different stress patterns. Participants were faster in reading pseudowords with antepenultimate than with penultimate stress. The effect was not driven by distributional information, but it was related to the stage of articulation planning. Overall, the experiments showed that, under certain conditions, readers assign stress using orthographic/ phonological distributional information. However, the distributional information does not speed up pseudoword naming, which is affected by stress computation at the level of the articulation planning of the stimulus. It is claimed that models of reading aloud and speech production should be merged at the level of phonological encoding, when segmental and metrical information are assembled and articulation is planned."

In lexical decision, nonword recognition responses were delayed if a similar word had been heard earlier. In contrast, nonword processing was facilitated by the earlier presentation of a similar nonword (boff-paff). This pattern was observed for both word-initial (beef-peef), and word-final (job-jop) deviation. With the word-in-noise task, real word primes (beef) increased real word intrusions for the target nonword (peef), but only consonant-vowel (CV) or vowel-consonant (VC) intrusions were increased with similar pseudoword primes (boff-paff).

We then tested the predictive power of this model for two types of decisions involving images: preference based selections (Study 2) and risk–reward trade-offs (Study 3). In both cases, the model derived in Study 1 predicted choice and outperformed competing models drawn from well-established theoretical views.

A large multinational study revealed a widespread tendency for fused individuals to endorse making extreme sacrifices for their country. Nevertheless, when asked which of several groups they were most inclined to die for, most participants favored relatively small groups, such as family, over a large and extended group, such as country (Study 1). To integrate these findings, we proposed that a common mechanism accounts for the willingness of fused people to die for smaller and larger groups. Specifically, when fused people perceive that group members share core characteristics, they are more likely to project familial ties common in smaller groups onto the extended group, and this enhances willingness to fight and die for the larger group. Consistent with this, encouraging fused persons to focus on shared core characteristics of members of their country increased their endorsement of making extreme sacrifices for their country. This pattern emerged whether the core characteristics were biological (Studies 2 and 3) or psychological (Studies 4-6) and whether participants were from China, India, the United States, or Spain. Further, priming shared core values increased the perception of familial ties among fused group members, which, in turn, mediated the influence of fusion on endorsement of extreme sacrifices for the country (Study 5). Study 6 replicated this moderated mediation effect whether the core characteristics were positive or negative. Apparently, for strongly fused persons, recognizing that other group members share core characteristics makes extended groups seem ""family like"" and worth dying for."

We also expected that a self-causal chunking strategy would make salient people's influence on their partners and thereby discourage them from concluding that their partners' behaviors reflected underlying dispositions. In contrast, we anticipated that an other-causal chunking strategy would obscure people's influence on their partners, thereby encouraging them to infer that their partners' behaviors reflected underlying dispositions. We tested these hypotheses by inducing participants to develop either a defensive or an offensive set prior to interacting with another person in a simulated arms race. After the interactions, we assessed the manner in which participants chunked their interactions, as well as their impressions of partners. The results supported our predictions.

Structural equation modeling analyses indicated (a) the executive component of WM and phonological STM yielded significant direct paths to problem-solving accuracy in the fully mediated model; (b) domain general knowledge (reading, calculation), domain-specific knowledge (problem representation, magnitude judgments) and domain general processes (inhibition) uniquely mediated the relationship between components of WM (executive, phonological STM) and problem-solving accuracy; and (c) those processes failing to uniquely mediate the relationship between WM and problem-solving accuracy in the full mediation model were measures of fluid intelligence, planning and estimation. The results support the notion that both the executive and phonological storage components of WM draw upon some of the same resources in predicting problem-solving, but none of the aforementioned mediation variables completely compensated for the influence of these 2 WM components on children’s mathematical word problem-solving. More importantly, the findings suggest there are multiple pathways that mediate the relationship between components of WM performance and problem-solving accuracy.

The results showed that (a) significant age-related differences in verbal and visual-spatial WM performance were maintained when articulation speed and short-term memory (the phonological system) were partialed from the analysis and (b) WM predicted age-related differences in word recognition and comprehension performance independent of the contribution of a short-term memory and articulatory rate. The results were interpreted as support for the notion that both the phonological and the executive systems are important predictors of age-related changes in reading but that these processes operate independent of each other in predicting fluent reading. Several implications of the results are discussed.

In nondyslexic individuals, improved immediate serial recall is typically observed when one particular sequence of items is repeated across an experimental session, a phenomenon known as the Hebb repetition effect. Starting from the critical observation that individuals with dyslexia seem to be selectively impaired in cognitive tasks that involve processing of serial order, the present study is the first to test and confirm the hypothesis that the Hebb repetition effect is affected in dyslexia, even for nonverbal modalities. We present a theoretical framework in which the Hebb repetition effect is assumed to be a laboratory analogue of naturalistic word learning, on the basis of which we argue that dyslexia is characterized by an impairment of serial-order learning that affects language learning and processing."

We further demonstrated that experimental exposure to multicultural experience caused a reduction in need for cognitive closure (NFCC; Studies 3 and 6) and that the ameliorative effects of multiculturalism experience on intergroup bias were fully mediated by lower levels of NFCC (Studies 4, 5, and 6). The beneficial effects of multiculturalism were found regardless of the targeted stereotype group (African Americans, Ethiopians, homosexuals, and native Israelis), regardless of whether multicultural experience was measured or manipulated, and regardless of the population sampled (Caucasian Americans or native Israelis), demonstrating the robustness of this phenomenon. Overall, these results demonstrate that multicultural experience plays a critical role in increasing social tolerance through its relationship to motivated cognitive processes."

Within-grade analyses indicated that phonological awareness accounted for more variance than rapid naming regardless of the nature of the outcome measure and grade. Rapid naming’s capacity to predict variance, while less than that of phonological awareness, tended to rise steadily and was highest in Grade 3. Phonological memory, as measured by this study’s tasks, showed almost no relationship to reading performance. The findings are discussed with respect to changing the requirements of Arabic reading in Grades K-3 and suggestions are made for future research."

Participants included two groups of children who had received a diagnosis of either SLI ( N  = 15) or DD ( N  = 15). For the between-groups comparison, the groups were matched pairwise on nonverbal IQ to 30 chronological age controls (CAC) and 30 reading level controls (RLC). For the within-group analyses, the participants were compared to 91 CACs and 63 RLCs. We developed tasks not used for the diagnoses to assess phonological skills (decoding, phonemic awareness, phonological STM) and non-phonological skills (listening and reading comprehension). SLI children scored lower than both DD children and RLCs on tasks assessing listening and reading comprehension, and lower than RLCs on phonological STM and phonemic awareness. Within-group comparisons showed that a higher proportion of SLI than DD children presented severe deficits in the same four domains. The opposite pattern was found for decoding skills (7 SLI children with a severe deficit, versus 13 in the DD group). These findings are discussed in the light of models explaining the overlap between SLI and DD. They highlight the need to assess both phonological and non-phonological skills in SLI and DD children, using both between- and within-groups designs."

However, perceivers cannot rely solely on self-knowledge to understand another person; they must also correct for differences between the self and others. Here we investigated serial adjustment as a mechanism for correction from self-knowledge anchors during social inferences. In 3 studies, participants judged the attitudes of a similar or dissimilar person and reported their own attitudes. For each item, we calculated the discrepancy between responses for the self and other. The adjustment process unfolds serially, so to the extent that individuals indeed anchor on selfknowledge and then adjust away, trials with a large amount of self–other discrepancy should be associated with longer response times, whereas small self–other discrepancy should correspond to shorter response times. Analyses consistently revealed this positive linear relationship between reaction time and self–other discrepancy, evidence of anchoring-and-adjustment, but only during judgments of similar targets. These results suggest that perceivers mentalize about similar others using the cognitive process of anchoring-and-adjustment."

Nevertheless, it is typically assumed that individuals regulate emotions to obtain hedonic, rather than utilitarian, benefits. In this study, the authors tested whether individuals represent the utility of pleasant and unpleasant emotions and whether they would be motivated to experience unpleasant emotions if they believed they could be useful. First, findings revealed that participants explicitly viewed approach emotions (e.g., excitement) as useful for obtaining rewards, but viewed avoidance emotions (e.g., worry) as useful for avoiding threats. Second, this pattern was replicated in implicit representations of emotional utility, which were dissociated from explicit ones. Third, implicit, but not explicit, representations of emotional utility predicted motives for emotion regulation. When anticipating a threatening task, participants who viewed emotions such as worry and fear as useful for avoiding threats preferred to engage in activities that were likely to increase worry and fear (vs. excitement) before the task. These findings demonstrate that utilitarian considerations play an important, if underappreciated, role in emotion regulation."

Instead, they may be motivated to experience even unpleasant emotions when they might be useful for goal attainment. Given that fear serves to promote successful avoidance, these studies tested this hypothesis by examining preferences for fear in preparation for avoidance goal pursuits. Consistent with the predictions of the instrumental approach, participants preferred to increase their level of fear as they prepared to pursue an avoidance goal. Such preferences were higher than preferences for either excitement or anger and were unique to avoidance (vs. approach or confrontational) goal pursuits. Given the aversive nature of fear, these findings clearly demonstrate that people may sometimes prefer to feel bad if doing so can lead to instrumental benefits."

Before entering college, individuals who held entity (vs. incremental) theories of emotion had lower emotion regulation self-efficacy and made less use of cognitive reappraisal (Part 1). Throughout their first academic term, entity theorists of emotion had less favorable emotion experiences and received decreasing social support from their new friends, as evidenced by weekly diaries (Part 2). By the end of freshman year, entity theorists of emotion had lower well-being, greater depressive symptoms, and lower social adjustment as indicated in both self- and peer-reports (Part 3). The emotional, but not the social, outcomes were partially mediated by individual differences in emotion regulation self-efficacy (Part 4).

METHOD:A 2001-2003 birth cohort of 145 extremely preterm/extremely low birth weight (EPT/ELBW) children from a single medical center, along with 111 normal birth weight (NBW) classmate controls, were recruited during their first year in kindergarten and followed annually across the next 2 years in school. Mixed model analysis was conducted to compare the groups on growth in achievement across years and examine kindergarten neuropsychological skills as predictors of growth. RESULTS:The EPT/ELBW group scored significantly below NBW controls on all achievement tests across years and had higher rates of special education placement and grade repetition. Despite limited catch-up of the EPT/ELBW group to the NBW controls in spelling, group differences were generally stable. Differences in spelling and mathematics achievement remained significant when controlling for global intelligence or excluding children who had intellectual or neurosensory impairments or repeated a grade. Higher scores on kindergarten tests of multiple neuropsychological ability domains predicted higher achievement levels and steeper growth in achievement. CONCLUSIONS:The findings document persistent academic weaknesses in EPT/ELBW children across the early school years.

However, research in forensic, legal, and social psychology demonstrates that people are generally very successful deceivers. The goal of the current research was to test an intervention with the potential to decrease the likelihood of successful deception. We applied findings in the architectural, engineering, and environmental sciences that has demonstrated that enriched environments (vs. scarce ones) promote the experience of comfort, positive emotion, feelings of power and control, and increase productivity. We hypothesized that sparse, impoverished, scarcely endowed environments (vs. enriched ones) would decrease the ability to lie successfully by making liars feel uncomfortable and powerless. Study 1 examined archival footage of an international sample of criminal suspects (N = 59), including innocent relatives (n = 33) and convicted murderers (n = 26) emotionally pleading to the public for the return of a missing person. Liars in scarce environments (vs. enriched) were significantly more likely to reveal their lies through behavioral cues to deception. Study 2 (N = 79) demonstrated that the discomfort and subsequent powerlessness caused by scarce (vs. enriched) environments lead people to reveal behavioral cues to deception. Liars in scarce environments also experienced greater neuroendocrine stress reactivity and were more accurately detected by a sample of 66 naive observers (Study 3). Taken together, data suggest that scarce environments increase difficulty, and decrease success, of deception. Further, we make available videotaped stimuli of Study 2 liars and truth-tellers.

Hundreds of studies in which observers judge the veracity of laboratory-created lies and truths suggest that this is a difficult task; in this context, lie-detection accuracy is notoriously poor. Challenging these findings and traditional methodologies in lie-detection research, we draw upon the somatic marker hypothesis and research on interoception to find that: (a) people experience physiological reactions indicating increased sympathetic arousal while observing real, high-stakes lies (vs. truths), and (b) attending to these physiological reactions may improve lie-detection accuracy. Consistent with the tipping point framework, participants demonstrated more physiological arousal and vasoconstriction while observing real crime liars versus truth-tellers, but not mock crime liars versus truth-tellers (Experiment 1; N = 48). Experiment 2 replicated this effect in a larger sample of participants (N = 169). Experiment 3 generalized this effect to a novel set of stimuli; participants demonstrated more physiological arousal to game show contestants who lied (vs. told the truth) about their intention to cooperate in a high-stakes economic game (N = 71). In an intervention study (Experiment 4; N = 428), participants were trained to attend to their physiological signals; lie-detection accuracy increased relative to a control condition. Experiment 5 (N = 354) replicated this effect, and the addition of a bogus training condition suggested that increased accuracy was not simply attributable to self-focused attention. Findings highlight the limitations of relying on laboratory-created lies to study human lie-detection and suggest that observers have automatic, physiological reactions to being deceived.

We aimed to unravel the recovery process by examining whether off-job activities enhance next morning vigor to the extent that they enable employees to relax and detach from work. In addition, we investigated whether adequate recovery also helps employees to work with more enthusiasm and vigor on the next workday. On five consecutive days, a total of 74 employees (356 data points) reported the hours they spent on various off-job activities, their feelings of psychological detachment, and feelings of relaxation before going to sleep. Feelings of vigor were reported on the next morning, and day-levels of work engagement were reported after work. As predicted, leisure activities (social, low-effort, and physical activities) increased next morning vigor through enhanced psychological detachment and relaxation. High-duty off-job activities (work and household tasks) reduced vigor because these activities diminished psychological detachment and relaxation. Moreover, off-job activities significantly affected next day work engagement. Our results support the assumption that recovery occurs when employees engage in off-job activities that allow for relaxation and psychological detachment. The findings also underscore the significance of recovery after work: Adequate recovery not only enhances vigor in the morning, but also helps employees to stay engaged during the next workday."

In Experiments 1A and 1B, participants prescribed more optimism for someone implementing decisions than for someone deliberating, indicating that people prescribe optimism selectively, when it can affect performance. Furthermore, participants believed optimism improved outcomes when a person�s actions had considerable, rather than little, influence over the outcome (Experiment 2). Experiments 3 and 4 tested the accuracy of this belief; optimism improved persistence, but it did not improve performance as much as participants expected. Experiments 5A and 5B found that participants overestimated the relationship between optimism and performance even when their focus was not on optimism exclusively.

We propose that the channel of confidence expression is one key moderator—that is, whether confidence is expressed verbally or nonverbally. In a series of experiments, participants assessed target individuals (potential collaborators or advisors) who were either overconfident or cautious. Targets expressed confidence, or a lack thereof, verbally or nonverbally. Participants then learned targets’ actual performance. Across studies, overconfidence was advantageous initially—regardless of whether targets expressed confidence verbally or nonverbally. After performance was revealed, overconfident targets who had expressed confidence verbally were viewed more negatively than cautious targets; however, overconfident targets who had expressed confidence nonverbally were still viewed more positively than cautious ones. The one condition wherein nonverbal overconfidence was detrimental was when confidence was clearly tied to a falsifiable claim. Results suggest that, compared with verbal statements, nonverbal overconfidence reaps reputational benefits because of its plausible deniability.

For example, attitudes higher in heritability are shown to be responded to more quickly, to be more resistant to change, and to be more consequential in the attitude similarity attraction relationship. The substantive results are interpreted in terms of attitude strength and niche building. More generally, the implications of heritability for the generality and typicality of treatment effects are also discussed. Although psychologists clearly recognize the impact of genetics on behavior, their theories rarely reflect this knowledge. Most theories assume that behavior is relatively plastic and is shaped almost entirely by situational parameters. The possibility that a response may have a high heritability is often ignored. I argue here that ignoring this possibility is consequential. The vehicle used in this article is attitudes. This vehicle was chosen because it is a domain with which I have some familiarity; it is a domain that has a number of minitheories, and it is a domain in which the notion of heritability itself is suspect so that a demonstration of the effects of heritability should be particularly evocative."

A case study is used to illustrate how to develop a fable from test data, information provided from parents, and one’s empathic understanding of a child. We then outline and illustrate a method—using the same case study—for presenting the fable to the child and parents together. Finally, we briefly provide four additional examples of fable construction.

However, despite the considerable amount of research on this topic, the conclusions in the literature are not always coherent. Therefore, there is a need to carry on the investigation, and this is the reason why we developed the operand recognition paradigm (ORP). It capitalizes on the fact that, contrary to retrieval, calculation procedures degrade the memory traces of the operands involved in a problem. As a consequence, the use of calculation procedures is inferred from relatively long recognition times of the operands. However, it has been suggested that recognition times within the ORP do not reflect strategies but the difficulty of switching from a difficult task (calculation) to a simpler one (recognition). In order to examine this possibility, in a series of 3 experiments we equalized switch-cost variations in all conditions through the introduction of intermediate tasks between problem solving and recognition. Despite this neutralization, we still obtained the classical effects of the ORP, namely longer recognition times after addition than after comparison. We conclude that the largest part of the ORP effects is related to different strategy use and not to difficulty-related switch costs. The possible applications and promising outcomes of the ORP in and outside the field of numerical cognition are discussed."

This egocentrism can bias their estimates of others’ knowledge. In 2 experiments, we examined whether people can diminish egocentrism when predicting for others. Participants answered general knowledge questions and then estimated how many of their peers would know the answers. Egocentrism was revealed in the relationship between participants’ own accuracy and their estimates of peer accuracy for questions that were new to the experiment. However, when participants encountered the answer to a question asked earlier in the experiment, they showed reduced egocentrism for these old relative to new questions (Experiment 1). Participants were aware that recent experience with answers spoiled their knowledge as a basis for estimating what others know. Consequently, they relied on more objective bases for prediction, which enhanced their ability to discriminate between questions that are easy versus difficult for others (i.e., relative accuracy). In Experiment 2, the relative accuracy of estimates of others’ knowledge was also enhanced when experience-based cues were blocked by presenting the answer with the question. Results are discussed in terms of a dual process theory of the bases (e.g., experience vs. theory) people use for predictions for others. Further, we discuss the effects of egocentrism in educational contexts, such as a professor estimating what students know. In sum, our findings show that people can shift away from their own knowledge to diminish egocentrism and to more accurately estimate what others know."

When the identity of a target stimulus is correlated with the duration of the preceding interval, performance is better for frequent than for infrequent combinations of target and interval. This effect has been demonstrated several times in current timing research. However, it can be accounted for by 2 starkly contrasting explanations. The standard account has explained it in terms of learning associations between intervals and stimulus-response events. But, alternatively the effect might be due to partial trial transition costs, because infrequent time-event combinations are proportionally more often partial transitions (i.e., transitions of either interval, or target). We conducted 3 choice response time experiments to distinguish between both explanations.

Structural equation modeling then evaluated a multi-level neural architecture with Covert Attention and Overt Behavior at one level, Word-Level Language Processes (Orthographic, Phonological, and Rapid Automatic Naming) at a second level, and Reading and Writing Achievement at a third level. Covert Attention, but not Overt Behavior, was significantly related to factors for orthographic coding of written words and rapid naming of orthographic stimuli, but not to the phonological coding factor for aural words. These orthographic, rapid naming, and phonological factors had significant paths to reading and writing outcomes, but the Covert Attention factor had links to reading and writing outcomes only through the mediating orthographic and rapid naming factors. Treatment and brain imaging studies provided converging evidence that attention may exert greater effects on orthographic word form than phonological word form. The neurolinguistic significance for a complex brain system, modeled at different levels of analysis, is that non-language processes such as attention may exert distal influences even though language exerts direct proximal influences on reading and writing outcomes; this claim is supported by recent physiological findings about the role of fast visual system as an attention gating mechanism in processing letter sequences. The educational significance is that instruction should direct dyslexic's attention to the orthographic units within written words to facilitate the translating of orthographic into phonological word forms."

START,START,2154207976,introduction advances in early detection of reading risk,2010,"jennifer m thomson, tiffany p hogan",journal of learning disabilities,1,2,2,"As we write the prologue to this special issue of the Journal of Learning Disabilities, “Advances in Early Detection of Reading Risk,” the U.S. National Early Literacy Panel (NELP) has recently released its report Developing Early Literacy (National Early Literacy Panel, 2008). A chapter of the report is devoted to reviewing studies that attempt to identify the most accurate preschool and kindergarten predictors of later outcomes in reading and spelling. The report is affirmative of an emerging consensus that the very early status of skills directly related to literacy—alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness, rapid automatic naming (RAN), phonological memory, and early writing—is highly correlated to early progress in reading, spelling, and writing. Yet the report also highlights how far we are from fully understanding the early development of literacy. As the authors point out, despite the scope of the analysis being from birth to 5 years old, the initial age of children in most of the studies available was 4 years of age or older and outcome variables generally did not go beyond second grade, with many studies restricting their focus to within-kindergarten relationships. In this way, the findings are highly influenced by proximity effects; namely, skills measurable immediately at the onset of literacy instruction yield the highest correlations to early literacy through both their cognitive and temporal proximity to early reading measures. Another somewhat surprising finding was the inconsistent predictive value of oral language once alphabetic knowledge and phonological awareness were controlled and further the observation that more complex oral language skills, such as grammar, definitional vocabulary, and listening comprehension, had stronger relationships with both decoding and reading comprehension compared to basic measures of vocabulary production/ understanding. The report calls for studies that help elucidate a more nuanced and dynamic understanding of the role of oral language in literacy development. In the collection of articles here, we set out to add meaningfully to the body of evidence summarized by the NELP report in several key ways. The first contribution is adding to the number of studies that go beyond the highly studied kindergarten to second grade period. Understanding associations between success in literacy acquisition and skills measured significantly before literacy emerges may be a more complex task than finding relationships with contiguous skills; however, early intervention really cannot be early enough unless we better understand trajectories of risk observable within the earliest stages of language learning. In “An Exploratory Study of the Development of Early Syllable Structure in Reading-Impaired Children,” Lambrecht Smith, Roberts, Locke, and Tozer report speech production data from the first longitudinal study to look in depth at babbling development between the ages of 8 and 19 months in a sample of children at genetic risk of reading difficulties. The findings are suggestive of phonological vulnerability in at-risk children from English-speaking families even from 8 months of age, with children later identified as reading disabled having a lower proportion of canonical babbling (containing true consonant and vowel combinations) as well as reduced syllable complexity within canonical babbling. In “Language Development, Literacy Skills and Predictive Connections to Reading in Finnish Children With and Without Familial Risk of Dyslexia,” Torppa, Lyytinen, Erskine, Eklund, and Lyytinen also expand our knowledge of very early predictors of literacy skills, within the context of the highly transparent Finnish orthography. In another longitudinal study of infants at genetic risk of reading difficulties, the study characterizes language skills from 11⁄2 years old onward. At 2 years of age, group differences and predictive relationships to reading difficulties at the end of second grade were found within the domains of expressive language and maximum sentence length (although in contrast to Lambrecht Smith et al., this study did not look at speech measures directly). From 21⁄2 years old, all measures except expressive language differentiated the group with dyslexia from the typically reading control group. The study also found that while significant group differences in receptive language were observed at these early ages, the predictive power of the measures in relation to reading was indirect. Receptive language measured at 2 to 21⁄2 years contributed most to subsequent development, however this was via inflectional morphology. Torppa et al. also conclude that “predictors"

Thirty-three children with dyslexia participated and were assigned to one of three groups (a) a novel rhythmic processing intervention designed to highlight auditory rhythmic information in non-speech and speech stimuli; (b) a commercially-available phoneme discrimination intervention; and (c) a no-intervention control. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks. Both interventions yielded equivalent and significant gains on measures of phonological awareness (at both rhyme and phoneme levels), with large effect sizes at the phoneme level. Both programs had medium effect sizes on literacy outcome measures, although gains were non-significant when compared to the controls. The data suggest that rhythmic training has an important role to play in developing the phonological skills that are critical for efficient literacy acquisition. It is suggested that combining both prosodic/rhythmic and phonemic cues in auditory training programs may offer advantages for children with developmental dyslexia. This may be especially true for those who appear resistant to conventional phonics training methods."

We propose that enacting ritualized actions can enhance subjective feelings of self-discipline, such that rituals can be harnessed to improve behavioral self-control. We test this hypothesis in 6 experiments. A field experiment showed that engaging in a pre-eating ritual over a 5-day period helped participants reduce calorie intake (Experiment 1). Pairing a ritual with healthy eating behavior increased the likelihood of choosing healthy food in a subsequent decision (Experiment 2), and enacting a ritual before a food choice (i.e., without being integrated into the consumption process) promoted the choice of healthy food over unhealthy food (Experiments 3a and 3b). The positive effect of rituals on self-control held even when a set of ritualized gestures were not explicitly labeled as a ritual, and in other domains of behavioral self-control (i.e., prosocial decision-making; Experiments 4 and 5). Furthermore, Experiments 3a, 3b, 4, and 5 provided evidence for the psychological process underlying the effectiveness of rituals: heightened feelings of self-discipline. Finally, Experiment 5 showed that the absence of a self-control conflict eliminated the effect of rituals on behavior, demonstrating that rituals affect behavioral self-control specifically because they alter responses to self-control conflicts. We conclude by briefly describing the results of a number of additional experiments examining rituals in other self-control domains. Our body of evidence suggests that rituals can have beneficial consequences for self-control. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"

Data were collected from 108 samples (N 12,463) comparing dyadic interracial and same-race interactions, predominantly featuring Black and White Americans. Effect sizes were small: Participants in same-race dyads tended to express marginally more positive attitudes about their partners (r .07), reported feeling less negative affect (r .10), showed more friendly nonverbal behavior (r .09), and scored higher on performance measures (r .07) than those in interracial dyads. Effect sizes also showed substantial heterogeneity, and further analyses indicated that intersectional, contextual, and relational factors moderated these outcomes. For example, when members of a dyad were the same sex, differences between interracial and same-race dyads in negative affect were reduced. Structured interactions led to more egalitarian performance outcomes than did free-form interactions, but the effects of interaction structure on nonverbal behavior depended on participant gender. Furthermore, benefits of intergroup contact were apparent: Differences in emotional state across dyadic racial composition disappeared in longer term interactions, and racial minorities, who often have greater experience with intergroup contact, experienced less negative affect in interracial interactions than did majority group members. Finally, there was a significant historical trend toward more egalitarian outcomes across dyadic racial composition for explicit attitudes and for nonverbal behavior; however, participants’ emotional responses and performance have remained consistent."

Additionally, the relative contribution of statistical learning alongside other cognitive measures known to be related to reading has not been examined. This study of sixty-five Norwegian school children (M = 10.3 years) found that performance on an independent statistical learning task predicted a small, but unique amount of variance in reading ability in Norwegian, even when a number of other reading-related cognitive skills were taken into account.

We show that people expect charitable donations—much like snowballs—to have more impact on nearby (vs. faraway) targets. Therefore, because making an impact is a powerful motivator of prosocial behavior, people are more willing to take action to help nearby (vs. faraway) causes—independent of social distance. Six studies, including lab and field experiments, and secondary data from fundraising campaigns support this prediction. Specifically, Study 1 shows that people expect charitable donations to have a greater impact on nearby (vs. faraway) recipients, and that these judgments stem from metaphorical thinking. In the context of alumni giving to their alma mater, the next two studies show that donations increase as real (Study 2) or perceived (Study 3) distances decrease. Study 4 extends these findings using a more conservative manipulation of distance perception (Study 4).

The DD group displayed difficulties with symbolic number processing but not with non-symbolic number processing. However, the underlying processes of this access or connection deficit appeared not to be related to phonological awareness or RAN.

We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the magnitude of the Flynn effect with a higher degree of precision, to determine the error of measurement, and to assess the impact of several moderator variables on the mean effect size. Across 285 studies (N = 14,031) since 1951 with administrations of 2 intelligence tests with different normative bases, the meta-analytic mean was 2.31, 95% CI [1.99, 2.64], standard score points per decade. The mean effect size for 53 comparisons (N = 3,951, excluding 3 atypical studies that inflate the estimates) involving modern (since 1972) Stanford-Binet and Wechsler IQ tests (2.93, 95% CI [2.3, 3.5], IQ points per decade) was comparable to previous estimates of about 3 points per decade but was not consistent with the hypothesis that the Flynn effect is diminishing. For modern tests, study sample (larger increases for validation research samples vs. test standardization samples) and order of administration explained unique variance in the Flynn effect, but age and ability level were not significant moderators. These results supported previous estimates of the Flynn effect and its robustness across different age groups, measures, samples, and levels of performance.

These studies also tended to infer culture as an explanation for the high achievement of Asian Americans without examining the impact of sociopolitical factors, such as racial discrimination. In fact, many of the reviewed studies reported that Asian Americans were deficient relative to Whites on attributes thought to be related to culture (e.g., personality characteristics, parenting behaviors) while finding that they achieved academically at levels similar to or higher than Whites. Finally, the majority of these studies have not used culturally appropriate methods to test their hypotheses and research questions. Thus, we recommend that studies embrace emic/population-specific and sociopolitical (Sasao & Sue, 1993) approaches to understand and explore factors that contribute to academic achievement in this group."

Special emphasis is placed on learning environments as potential moderators of the direction of these effects. According to the meritocracy principle presented here, so-called bottom-up effects (i.e., self-esteem is influenced by academic self-concept) are more pronounced in meritocratic learning environments than in ego-protective learning environments. This hypothesis was examined using a three-wave cross-lagged panel design with a large sample of 7th graders from East and West Germany, a total of 5,648 students who were tested shortly after German reunification. Reciprocal effects were found between self-esteem, academic self-concept, and academic achievement. In conformance with the meritocracy principle, support for bottom-up effects was stronger in the meritocratic learning environment."

This article reports two eye-tracking experiments investigating the effects of a prime sentence on the processing of a target sentence that shared aspects of syntactic form. The experiments were designed to determine the degree to which lexical overlap between prime and target sentences produced larger effects, comparable to the widely observed ‘lexical boost’ in production experiments (Pickering & Branigan, 1998; Pickering & Ferreira, 2008). The current experiments showed that priming effects during on-line comprehension were in fact larger when a verb was repeated across the prime and target sentences (see also Tooley et al., 2009). The finding of larger priming effects with lexical repetition supports accounts under which syntactic form representations are connected to individual lexical items (e.g., Vosse & Kempen, 2000, 2009; Tomasello, 2003)."

The options had abstract or goal-relevant features (called high-level construal features) as well as more concrete or goal-irrelevant features (called low-level construal features). The studies varied the valence (positive vs. negative) and the type of valence (affective vs. cognitive) of the low-level and high-level construal features. The results show that the weight of high-level construal features, compared with the weight of low-level construal features, is greater in determining distant future preferences than near future preferences. The implications of the results for extant theories of time-dependent changes in preference are discussed. How do we evaluate and make decisions regarding near versus distant future actions? For example, how likely are we to decide to start a diet, open a savings account, or volunteer for community service as we get closer in time to actual engagement in these activities? The question we address in this article is whether temporal distance from actual engagement in an activity can in- fluence our decisions when the information about the activity remains the same. Can temporal distance in and of itself system- atically change or even reverse our preferences? We propose that temporal distance systematically influences the way we construe future activities and that construal, in turn, may change our pref- erences.

Compared with controls, dyslexics had slower reaction times overall and, for low frequency items, the degree of facilitation from phonologically related sound segments relative to unrelated segments was proportionally greater. Within the dyslexic group, phonological facilitation was greater and picture naming speed slower for poorer compared with better readers. Phonological facilitation and picture naming speed was unrelated to reading ability in the normal readers. The results suggest that phonological encoding during speech production is less efficient in some children with dyslexia and that hearing part of the target word strongly facilitates this process.

We predicted that the more people valued and ideally wanted to feel excitement and other high arousal positive states (HAP), the more affiliative (extraverted, agreeable) they would judge excited (vs. calm) faces. Moreover, because European Americans typically value HAP more than Hong Kong Chinese do, we predicted that European Americans would rate excited (vs. calm) targets as more affiliative than would Hong Kong Chinese. We found consistent support for these hypotheses in four studies. In Studies 1a and 1b, these effects held regardless of target race (White, Asian) and target sex (male, female); emerged for human as well as computer-generated faces; and did not consistently emerge for nonaffiliative social judgments (i.e., dominance, competence). In Studies 2 and 3, we replicated these findings in more realistic contexts. In Study 2, culture and ideal affect predicted participants’ extraversion judgments of excited Facebook profiles. In Study 3, culture and ideal affect predicted participants’ extraversion and agreeableness judgments of an excited job applicant, which increased their likelihood of hiring that applicant. Together, these findings suggest that people’s culture and ideal affect shape how affiliative they judge excited (vs. calm) smiles.

Children in a control group heard an unrelated Story 2 and did not alter their retelling of Story 1. Good verbal skills facilitated the integration of the friend's perspective in memory for the children who heard the friend's explanation. Higher scores on the working memory and inhibition tasks were associated with higher verbal ability scores. Older children had better working memory and inhibitory skills than younger children. Cultural engagement predicted better social competence ratings but not higher memory reframing scores as predicted.

Dual-route theories, suggesting that reading skill results in direct access, are consistent with the notion of automaticity as memory retrieval. If word reading reflects memory retrieval, the Stroop effect should be absent in the absence of cues normally serving for retrieval. The Stroop effect was obtained in Hebrew-English bilinguals for cross-script homophones, which have meaning as color names in one language but are written in a script of the other language. The Stroop effect in cross-script homophones was independent of response mode and was insensitive to color-related proportion, supporting the assumption of different routes being involved in access to meaning of regular words and cross-script homophones. Implications for automaticity, theories of word reading, and knowledge representation by bilinguals are discussed. Reading is a cognitive skill that most humans acquire early and use extensively during their lives. The term word reading, as used by us, refers to mapping from strings of graphemes (i.e., written words) to meaning, when such strings are presented in isolation. Because extensive practice leads to automatic processing (Logan, 1988a), most investigators agree that word reading, at least in skilled readers, is an automatic process. In this article we analyze word reading from the viewpoint of approaches to automaticity. Our study has implications for theories of automaticity on the one hand and for theories of word reading on the other. In addition, because of the special kinds of stimuli we used, our findings are also relevant to the issue of knowledge representation by bilinguals."

Fifth-three typical developing children from 2nd to 6th grades were asked to perform the pronounceability judgment task on a set of Chinese real characters, pseudocharacters and noncharacters, as ERPs were recorded. The cluster-based permutation analysis revealed that children with low- to medium-reading ability showed greater negativity to noncharacters than to real characters and pseudocharacters in frontal sites from 300 to 450 ms, while children with high ability group showed a greater positivity to noncharacters than both real character and pseudocharacters at central to posterior sites. Furthermore, the linear mixed model (LMM) analysis was applied to investigate the relationship between lexicality effects on N400 and reading-related behavioral assessments on a set of standardized tests (including character recognition, vocabulary size, phonological awareness, and working memory). The results found that in children with lower reading ability, the N400 elicited by noncharacters becomes more negative in the frontal sites. For children with higher reading ability, the N400 elicited by noncharacters became more positive than that elicited by real characters or pseudocharacters in the posterior sites. These findings demonstrate the developmental changes in the lexicality effects on N400 as children become more advanced readers and suggest the lexicality effects on N400 can serve as neural markers for the evaluation of orthographic proficiency in reading development."

These processes have been conceptualized as a form of phonological processing, as speed of processing orthographic units, and as sensitivity to arbitrary associations between phonology and orthography. This study looks at these models longitudinally with 86 children across grades K-2 using spellings of the -ed suffix in past tense verbs as a measure of orthographic conventions learned while scanning text during reading. Regression analysis results indicated that both phonological awareness and rapid serial in kindergarten made unique contributions to Grade 2 reading and spelling measures. Controlling for early word reading and vocabulary, these contributions were strongest for pseudo word accuracy in the case of phonological awareness, and to spelling of arbitrary orthographic conventions in the case of rapid serial naming, but both kindergarten measures made unique contributions to late word-reading rate."

Next, two experimental studies (Study 2: N = 412 working and non-working adults, and Study 3: N = 300 working adults) showed that increasing self-concordance of environmentally sustainable behaviors by asking people to cognitively connect either sustainable energy use (Study 2) or commuting behaviors (Study 3) to their personal goals increased intentions to engage in these behaviors compared to a control condition (Study 2 and Study 3) and compared to persuasion attempts based on climate change mitigation (Study 3).

Individuals were coded as having a focal deficit if either neurologic or neuropsychological evaluation demonstrated focal dysfunction. Those with abnormal MRI findings were categorized based on findings. Children with abnormalities from each of these categories were compared in terms of deficits in automaticity, as measured by the tasks of Rapid Automatized Naming, Rapid Alternating Stimulus Naming, or the timed motor performance battery from the Physical and Neurological Examination for Soft Signs.

The overall results showed that the relative strength of the contributions of phonological awareness and rapid naming to word reading fluency shifted as a function of reading expertise: The contribution of phonological awareness remained significant in all grades but decreased as a function of grade, whereas the contribution of rapid naming increased. Orthographic depth systematically modulated the strength of the cognitive contributions to reading, but not the overall developmental pattern. Together, these results indicate that the cognitive development of reading skill is fairly universal (at least for alphabetic scripts) and that differences in orthographic depth will not recruit different cognitive processes but will mainly be expressed in rate of reading development"

The results indicated a different developmental pattern for spelling than for reading. At initial phases of literacy acquisition, phonological awareness and letter-sound matching skills contributed to both reading and spelling performance. However, in contrast to the declining influence of phonological awareness and letter-sound matching skills on fluent word reading (see also Vaessen & Blomert, 2010), the contributions of these skills to spelling performance were stable over the years, suggesting an ongoing reliance on orthography/phonology mappings during spelling.

In this study, we explore the accuracy of inferences regarding criminality made after brief exposure to static images of convicted criminals' and non-criminals' faces. We begin with a background of research and theory on the curiously recurrent, and historically controversial, topic of appearance-based inferences of criminality, and a brief justification of our re-opening of the debate about the accuracy of appearance-based criminality judgments. We then report two experiments in which participants, given a set of headshots of criminals and non-criminals, were able to reliably distinguish between these two groups, after controlling for the gender, race, age, attractiveness, and emotional displays, as well as any potential clues of picture origin. Empirical and theoretical implications, limitations, and further questions are discussed in light of these findings."

In an event-related brain potential (ERP) experiment, subjects heard Dutch stories that supported the prediction of a specific noun. To probe whether this noun was anticipated at a preceding indefinite article, stories were continued with a gender-marked adjective whose suffix mismatched the upcoming noun’s syntactic gender. Predictioninconsistent adjectives elicited a differential ERP effect, which disappeared in a no-discourse control experiment. Furthermore, in self-paced reading, prediction-inconsistent adjectives slowed readers down before the noun. These findings suggest that people can indeed predict upcoming words in fluent discourse and, moreover, that these predicted words can immediately begin to participate in incremental parsing operations."

In particular, hypotheses derived from theories on phonological processing, rapid automatized naming, working memory, and automatization of skills were tested. To overcome the definition and selection problems of many previous studies, we included in our study all students in the first year of secondary special education in a Dutch school district. Participants were classified as either dyslexic, garden-variety, or hyperlexic poor readers, according to the degree of discrepancy between their word recognition and listening comprehension scores. In addition, groups of normal readers were formed, matching the poor readers in either reading age or chronological age. A large test battery was administered to each student, including phonological, naming, working memory, speed of processing, and motor tests. The findings indicate that dyslexia is associated with deficits in (1) phonological recoding, word recognition (both in their native Dutch and in English as a second language), and spelling skills; and (2) naming speed for letters and digits. Dyslexia was not associated with deficits in other areas. The results suggest that developmental dyslexia, at the age of 12, might be (or might have become) a difficulty rather isolated from deficiencies in other cognitive and motor skills."

We assessed adolescents' word, pseudoword and text reading fluency, as well as their rapid naming abilities, at the beginning and after a half-year of education. The results showed that fluency development for real words, pseudowords and texts continues beyond the primary grades, and that the degree of improvement was similar across educational tracks. Word reading fluency and change in word reading fluency predicted text reading fluency development. No additional effect was found for pseudoword reading fluency. Finally, rapid naming ability was not only related to initial text reading fluency, but also to development of text reading fluency.

First, whether the contribution of visual attention span to reading was independent of rapid naming. Participants were 117 second graders and 111 fifth graders. Visual attention span was a significant predictor of both beginning and advanced word reading fluency, after controlling for rapid naming. Second, we examined the relation of visual attention span with spelling performance in a sample of 255 fourth graders.

The results indicate that, compared to color- and picture-naming speeds and nonnaming or visual matching speed, letter- and number-naming speeds are superior predictors of word reading speed. Furthermore, throughout the grade levels, associations between alphanumeric naming and monosyllabic word reading speeds are considerably stronger than for a widely used Dutch single-word reading test combining monosyllabic and multisyllabic words. It is suggested that, unlike multisyllabic words but similar to letters and numbers, monosyllabic words act as relatively holistic stimuli, which are recognized as sight words."

Use of these instruments with female offenders is, however, common practice. This use with female offenders implies the assumption that the risk of recidivism can be predicted on the basis of the same risk factors for women as for men. Yet, this implied gender-neutrality of offender risk instruments has been the topic of much debate. This study compared criminogenic needs in male and female offenders and their relevance in predicting recidivism. A large sample of male and female offenders (N = 16,239) charged with a range of index offenses was studied. Results mainly support the gender neutrality of existing offender risk and needs assessment. However, results do suggest that some criminogenic needs may indeed have a different impact on recidivism for men and women. Problems with accommodation, education and work, and relationships with friends were more strongly correlated to general recidivism in men than in women. For women, difficulties with emotional well-being had a stronger correlation with recidivism than for men. In addition, relative to all other criminogenic needs, problems with emotional well-being were more important for women than for men in predicting general as well as violent recidivism. However, because the bivariate correlation for female offenders between emotional difficulties and recidivism is weak (as it is for male offenders), the question remains whether the relative importance of emotional difficulties in predicting recidivism in women actually has clinical relevance.

It is shown that the positive manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions between cognitive processes during development. A single underlying g factor plays no role in the model. The model offers explanations of important findings in intelligence research, such as the hierarchical factor structure of intelligence, the low predictability of intelligence from early childhood performance, the integration/differentiation effect, the increase in heritability of g, and the Jensen effect, and is consistent with current explanations of the Flynn effect."

We operationalized social mindfulness in a new social decision-making paradigm that focuses on leaving or limiting choice options for others that we tested across 7 studies. Studies 1a through 1c showed that people with other-oriented mindsets left interdependent others more choice than people with self-oriented and/or unspecified mindsets. Studies 2a and 2b revealed that people developed more favorable judgments of a socially mindful than of a socially unmindful person. Study 3 revealed that unknown others with trustworthy (vs. untrustworthy) faces were met with more social mindfulness. Study 4 revealed that social mindfulness could be traced in personality by being positively related to Honesty-Humility and Agreeableness (HEXACO Personality Inventory-Revised) as well as to Empathy (Interpersonal Reactivity Index) and a prosocial value orientation (SVO).

An alternative conceptual framework is proposed that tests the hypothesis that the environment has differential (nonuniform) effects on children. A demonstration of the utility of this framework is provided by examining the effects of family resources on children’s academic outcomes in a multisite study (N = 6,305). Three distinctive groups of children were identified, including 1 group particularly resilient to influence of low levels of family resources. Predictors of group differences including parenting and child demographics are tested, the replicability of the results are examined, and findings are contrasted with those obtained with traditional regression interaction effects.

Drawing on emotions as social information (EASI) theory (Van Kleef, 2009), we hypothesized that people use the emotional expressions of others to inform their own attitudes, but only when they are sufficiently motivated and able to process those expressions. Five experiments support these ideas. Participants reported more positive attitudes about various topics after seeing a source’s sad (rather than happy) expressions when topics were negatively framed (e.g., abandoning bobsleighing from the Olympics). Conversely, participants reported more positive attitudes after seeing happy (rather than sad) expressions when topics were positively framed (e.g., introducing kite surfing at the Olympics). This suggests that participants used the source’s emotional expressions as information when forming their own attitudes. Supporting this interpretation, effects were mitigated when participants’ information processing was undermined by cognitive load or was chronically low. Moreover, a source’s anger expressions engendered negative attitude change when directed at the attitude object and positive change when directed at the recipient’s attitude. Effects occurred regardless of whether emotional expressions were manipulated through written words, pictures of facial expressions, film clips containing both facial and vocal emotional expressions, or emoticons.

To remedy these shortcomings, the author presents an alternative feedforward connectionist model that prior research has shown to be susceptible to the classical attribution principles of covariation. discounting, and augmentation.

Results showed that children with ID scored below the NLA group on all literacy and precursor measures. Structural equation modeling evidenced that in the children with NLA early literacy was directly predicted by phonological awareness, PSTM and vocabulary, with nonverbal reasoning and auditory discrimination also predicting phonological awareness. In children with ID however, the variation in word decoding was predicted by letter knowledge and nonverbal reasoning, whereas letter knowledge was predicted by rapid naming, which on its turn was predicted by attentional skills. It can be concluded phonological awareness plays a differential role in the early literacy skills of children with and without ID. As a consequence, the arrears in phonological awareness in children with ID might put them on hold in gaining proper access to literacy acquisition.

It addresses factors that influence early literacy learning, which have not been investigated thoroughly in this special and specific group. Furthermore, the children are not tested solely on literacy, but also on cognitive measures that may influence literacy acquisition. Whereas most research in ID focuses on groups with specific syndromes/etiologies, this paper takes a varied group of children with ID into account. The paper also adds to educational insights, since the findings imply that children with ID are able to use phonological pathways in learning to read.

We used a model-based clustering approach to delineate profiles of arithmetic fact development based on empirically derived differences in parameters of arithmetic fact mastery repeatedly assessed at the start of three subsequent school years: third, fourth, and fifth grades. This cluster analysis revealed three profiles in a random sample—slow and variable (n = 8), average (n = 24), and efficient (n = 20)—that were marked by differences in children’s development in arithmetic fact mastery from third grade to fifth grade. These profiles did not differ in terms of age, sex, socioeconomic status, or intellectual ability. In addition, we explored whether these profiles varied in cognitive skills that have been associated with individual differences in single-digit arithmetic. The three profiles differed in nonsymbolic and symbolic numerical magnitude processing as well as phonological processing, but not in digit naming or working memory. After also controlling for cluster differences in general mathematics achievement and reading ability, only differences in symbolic numerical magnitude processing remained significant. Taken together, our longitudinal data reveal that symbolic numerical magnitude processing represents an important variable that contributes to individual variability in children’s acquisition of arithmetic facts."

However, the practical application of these models is notoriously complicated, and flexible methods are largely nonexistent. We combine a popular model for choice response times—the Wiener diffusion process—with techniques from psychometrics in order to construct a hierarchical diffusion model. Chief among these techniques is the application of random effects, with which we allow for unexplained variability among participants, items, or other experimental units. These techniques lead to a modeling framework that is highly flexible and easy to work with. Among the many novel models this statistical framework provides are a multilevel diffusion model, regression diffusion models, and a large family of explanatory diffusion models. We provide examples and the necessary computer code."

However, literature remains unclear: (a) whether RAN is independent of PA, (b) about the specific influences of PA and RAN on reading and spelling, (c) about the efficacy of a RAN intervention. This study aims to address these issues by means of an intervention design. Precisely, the objectives are (a) to determine whether training one competence involves or not an effect on the other, (b) to examine whether each intervention based on oral abilities (PA vs RAN), could improve word reading and word spelling performances, (c) to assess the efficacy of a RAN-objects intervention. Thirty-six French-speaking second graders, from two Belgian elementary schools, were divided into two groups, and received either a PA or a RAN-objects intervention. Twenty-five-minute lessons took place at school twice a week over a period of two months. Both groups were compared on multiple experimental measures (PA, RAN, word reading, and word spelling), before and immediately after the intervention, and six months later. Results showed specific efficacy of the two interventions, with participants trained in one ability outperforming those from the other group on this specific ability at post-test. Moreover, the PA intervention revealed transfer effects on the sub-lexical processes of spelling, while the RAN intervention enhanced word reading speed. Finally, the results demonstrated the efficacy of a RAN-objects intervention for the first time. These findings provide a new piece of evidence showing the independence of PA and RAN, each process influencing the acquisition of literacy skills in a different way. The efficacy and the specific transfer effects of both interventions open up new perspectives for prevention and targeted remediation of reading disabilities."

With respect to interdependent behaviors such as condom use however relationship dynamics influence individuals power to make decisions and to act. OBJECTIVE: The current study examines how relationship dynamics impact 3 condom use relevant outcomes: (a) the individual forming his or her own intention to use condoms (b) the couple forming their joint intention to use condoms and (c) actual condom use behavior. METHOD: We conducted a 2-wave longitudinal study of young heterosexual adult couples at high risk for HIV infection involving the collection of both individual- and couple-derived data. RESULTS: Results demonstrate the importance of both person (e.g. biological sex and dispositional dominance) and relational (e.g. relational power and amount of interest in the relationship operationalized as commitment and perceived alternatives to the relationship) factors in predicting condom use intentions and behavior. Individuals who are lower in dispositional dominance are likely to incorporate their partners intentions into their own individual intentions; the intentions of individuals who have less interest in the relationship are more highly predictive of the couples joint intention; and the intentions of men and individuals higher in relationship power are more likely to exert a direct influence on condom use. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for improving the health of high-risk individuals including suggesting situations in which individuals are highly influenced by their partners intentions.

Children with SLI had problems with phonological awareness (PA) and verbal short-term memory (vSTM) in kindergarten.

However, the presence and precise nature of these deficits and the direction of their relation with reading, remains debated. In this longitudinal study, 87 five-year-olds at high and low family risk for dyslexia were followed before and during different stages of reading acquisition. The processing of different auditory cues was investigated, together with performance on speech perception and phonology and reading. Results show no effect of family risk for dyslexia on prereading auditory processing and speech perception skills. However, a relation is present between the performance on these skills in kindergarten and later phonology and literacy. In particular, links are found with the auditory processing of cues characteristic for the temporal speech amplitude envelope, rather than with other auditory cues important for speech intelligibility. Hereby, cues embedded in the speech amplitude envelope show to be related to a broad range of phonological precursors for reading. In addition, speech-in-noise perception demonstrates to operate as the most contributing factor for later phonological awareness and to be a predictor for reading mediated by the association with phonology. This study provides behavioral support for the link between prereading speech amplitude envelope processing and speech perception for future phonology and reading."

START,START,2163047940,investigating the orientation effect on the water level task who when and why,1994,"ross vasta, christine belongia, chalyce ribble",developmental psychology,1,12,56,"Four experiments with adults on Piaget's (J. Piaget & B. Inhelder, 1956) water-level task investigated previous reports that containers tilted at larger angles produce more error than those tilted at smaller angles. Experiment 1 found that this orientation effect occurred in both male and female subjects when the angles were manipulated between subjects but was absent in male subjects when manipulated within subjects. Experiments 2 and 3 indicated that male, and to a lesser degree female subjects, appear to benefit from exposure to easier (less-tilted) stimulus trials and, as a result, perform more accurately on subsequent difficult trials. Experiment 4 implicated mental rotation processes in the orientation effect by demonstrating that accuracy varied as a function of how far subjects needed to mentally rotate the container from its initial position to its test position. A developmental sequence is proposed in which relevant spatial abilities are assumed to facilitate acquisition of the principle that liquids are invariantly horizontal, which in turn leads to more accurate performance on the task. Differences in cognitive strategies may be responsible for the Gender X Orientation interaction observed under some conditions. One of Piaget's most fascinating developmental tasks is the water-level problem, designed originally to assess children's emerging understanding of Euclidean (three-dimensional) space (Piaget & Inhelder, 1956). According to Piaget, at some point during the concrete operations period, children come to realize that the location of objects can be specified in relation to stable vertical and horizontal coordinates in the environment. The development of this spatial system, in turn, leads children to observe in their everyday activities that the surface of a liquid remains invariantly horizontal regardless of the orientation of its container. Thus, when Piaget presented subjects with a partially filled bottle and asked them to predict how the water line would look if the bottle were tilted, he reported that those beyond the age of 9 years generally indicated that the surface would remain horizontal. It has become increasingly clear, however, that the water-level task may not be a very good index of this kind of spatial knowledge (Liben, 1991). Although children in the concrete operations period do indeed develop an understanding of Euclidean space—as demonstrated by their performance on other spatial tasks—there is little evidence that this cognitive accomplishment results directly in their acquiring the principle that liquids remain invariantly horizontal. In fact, subsequent research with the water-level problem has instead found that many adolescents and adults perform poorly on the task and also cannot"

Both direct and extended positive and negative contact experiences are included in the design. Intergroup anxiety is tested as a mediator between different forms of contact and prejudice, and status as Dutch majority or Muslim minority is used as a moderator. Method: A sample of 317 Dutch majority (47.6% female) and 369 Muslim minority (52.0% female) youth, ranging in age from 12 to 19 years completed self-reports about contact experiences, intergroup threat, and prejudice. Results: Results show that status as a Dutch majority or Muslim minority is a moderator in the relations between contact, intergroup anxiety, and prejudice. In the majority sample, all forms of direct and extended contact were related to prejudice and mediated by intergroup anxiety in the expected directions. In the Muslim minority sample, only positive contact was related to prejudice and mediated by intergroup anxiety in the expected direction. Conclusions: These findings underline that studies on intergroup relations should take both positive and negative contact experiences for intergroup attitudes into account as well as the majority or minority status of the groups involved. Moreover, the study suggests that partly different explanations may be needed for minority and majority groups for the role of intergroup contact in intergroup attitudes.

Faster rates of improvement in literacy within the more transparent language (Herero) supported the predictions of the script dependent hypothesis. However, the central processing hypothesis was also supported by evidence indicating that common underlying cognitive-linguistic processing skills predicted literacy levels across the two languages.

The preview of a target word was manipulated so that it was either identical (e.g., sped), a higher frequency orthographic neighbor (seed), a nonword neighbor (sted) or an all-letter-different nonword (glat). Ninety-four skilled adult readers were assessed on measures of reading and spelling ability. The results showed that null effects of preview lexical status in the average data obscured systematic differences on the basis of proficiency and target neighborhood density. For targets from dense neighborhoods, inhibition from a higher frequency neighbor preview occurred amongst highly proficient readers, and particularly those with superior spelling ability, in early fixation measures. Poorer readers showed inhibition only in second-pass reading of the target. These data suggest that readers with precise lexical representations are more likely to extract lexical information from a word before it is fixated.

Prevention strategies in early adolescence are designed to reduce substance use and progressions to problematic use by adulthood. This report examines the long-term effects of offering Family Check-up (FCU) at multiple time points in secondary education on the progression of substance use from age 11 to 23 years. METHOD:Participants (N = 998; 472 females) were randomly assigned individuals to intervention or control in Grade 6 and offered a multilevel intervention that included a classroom-based intervention (universal), the FCU (selected), and tailored family management treatment (indicated). Among intervention families, 23% engaged in the selected and indicated levels during middle school. RESULTS:Intention to treat analyses revealed that randomization to the FCU was associated with reduced growth in marijuana use (p < .05), but not alcohol and tobacco use.

Facial appearance is one such source and judgments based on facial appearance are made after minimal exposure to faces. A more reliable source of information is affective person learning based on others’ past actions. Here we investigated whether the effects of such appearance-independent learning on face evaluation emerge after rapid face exposure, a response deadline procedure, and a lack of explicit recognition of the faces. In three experiments, participants learned to associate novel faces with negative and positive behaviors, and then evaluated the faces presented on their own, without the behaviors. Even after extremely brief exposures (e.g., 35 ms), participants evaluated faces previously associated with negative behaviors more negatively than those associated with positive behaviors (Experiment 1). The learning effect persisted when participants were asked to evaluate briefly presented faces before a response deadline (Experiment 2), although the effect was diminished. Finally, although this learning effect increased as a function of face recognition (Experiment 3), it was present with only minimal recognition, suggesting that participants do not need to deliberately retrieve behavioral information for it to influence face evaluation. Together, the findings suggest that person learning unrelated to facial appearance is a powerful determinant of face evaluation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"

Individuals embedded within congruent social networks (i.e., made up of others with similar views) were more resistant to attitude change than were individuals embedded within heterogeneous social networks (i.e., made up of others with a range of views). Mediational evidence suggests that attitudinally congruous social networks may increase attitude strength by decreasing attitudinal ambivalence and perhaps by increasing the certainty with which people hold their attitudes. These results suggest that features of the social context in which an attitude is held have important implications for individual-level attitude strength."

Self-care methods do not appear to be as effective as formal intervention methods. Instructional programs involving physicians were not more effective than other instructional programs. Conditioning-based techniques such as aversive methods had success rates similar to those of instructional methods, and among the instructional methods, those incorporating social norms and values were more successful than those relying solely on didactic approaches. Cumulation of quit rates from all available control groups indicated that, on average, 6.4% of the smokers could be expected to quit smoking without any intervention. This figure must be subtracted from the raw success rate to obtain the net success rate for each program. Directions for future research are discussed. Smoking is a significant source of death and disease (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1989), with more than one out of every six American deaths resulting from cigarette smoking. With increasing evidence confirming the link between smoking and health hazards (Fielding, 1985), programs and policies to combat smoking have proliferated. Many reviews have examined the effectiveness of the methods used in these programs (e.g., Bernstein, 1969; Bruvold & Rundall, 1988; Callner, 1975; Cohen et al, 1989; Keutzer, Lichtenstein, &"

Results revealed age-related increases in PM performance across childhood. Working memory updating load had a negative impact on PM performance and monitoring behavior in older children, but this effect was smaller in younger children. Moreover, the frequency as well as the pattern of time monitoring predicted children's PM performance. Our interpretation of these results is that processes involved in children's PM may show a qualitative shift over development from simple, nonstrategic monitoring behavior to more strategic monitoring based on internal temporal models that rely specifically on working memory updating resources.

For male adolescents, psychological problem behaviors collectively mediated the relationship between community violence exposure and student-teacher connectedness. For female adolescents, both community violence and marital conflict exposure were negatively related to both GPA and student-teacher connectedness via aggressive behavior.

However, it is yet unclear whether these different tasks measure a unitary shifting ability or reflect different facets thereof. In this study, 20 task pairs were administered to 119 young adults to assess 5 proposed components of mental set shifting: switching between judgments, stimulus dimensions, stimulus-response mappings, response sets, and stimulus sets. Modeling latent factors for each of the components revealed that a model with 5 separate yet mostly correlated factors fit the data best. In this model, the components most strongly related to the other latent factors were stimulus-response mapping shifting and, to a lesser degree, response set shifting. In addition, both factors were statistically indistinguishable from a second-order general shifting factor. In contrast, shifting between judgments as well as stimulus dimensions consistently required separate factors and could, hence, not fully be accounted for by the general shifting factor. Finally, shifting between stimulus sets was unrelated to any other shifting component but mapping shifting. We conclude that tasks assessing shifting between mappings are most adequate to assess general shifting ability. In contrast, shifting between stimulus sets (e.g., as in the Trail Making Test) probably reflects shifts in visual attention rather than executive shifting ability."

In the case of sentencing, this raises the question of whether the sentencing decisions of prosecutors and judges are consistent with legal policy. Especially in handling low-level crimes, legal personnel suffer from high case loads and time pressure, which can make it difficult to comply with the often complex rulings of the law. To understand the cognitive processes underlying sentencing decisions, an analysis of trial records in cases of larceny, fraud, and forgery was conducted. Applying a Bayesian approach, five models of human judgment were tested against each other to predict the sentencing recommendations of the prosecution and to identify the crucial factors influencing sentencing decisions. The factors influencing sentencing were broadly consistent with the penal code. However, the prosecutors considered only a limited number of factors and neglected factors that were legally relevant and rated as highly important. Furthermore, testing the various cognitive judgment models against each other revealed that the sentencing process was apparently not consistent with the judgment policy recommended by the legal literature. Instead, the results show that prosecutors’ sentencing recommendations were best described by the mapping model, a heuristic model of quantitative estimation. According to this model, sentencing recommendations rely on a categorization of cases based on the cases’ characteristics."

Path analysis showed that cross-group friendships were associated with meta-attitudinally stronger and more accessible out-group attitudes, and the effects on all 3 criterion variables were mediated by intergroup anxiety. In Study 2, the authors sought to replicate the basic results of Study 1, while additionally exploring mediational effects of closeness of cross-group friendship and moderational effects of perceived group typicality. Structural equation modeling showed that cross-group friendships were associated with meta-attitudinally stronger and more accessible out-group attitudes; friendships had indirect effects on all 3 criterion variables, via closeness of friendship and intergroup anxiety. Closeness of friendship only predicted lower intergroup anxiety, however, when the out-group friend was perceived as highly typical.

Since any such evolving standards rest so fully on changing cultural norms, an important question is how these standards correspond to the moral intuitions of lay citizens asked to take the role of judge in hypothetical cases. Do factors such as whether one parent had an extramarital affair influence their custody decision-making? In the current studies, a representative sample of citizens awaiting jury service were first given a neutral scenario portraying an “average” family. Almost 80% favored dividing custodial time equally between the two parents, replicating our earlier finding. Then, in Study 1, they were given a second, Test case, vignette in which either the mother or the father was said to have carried on an extramarital affair that “essentially ruined the marriage”. In Study 2, either the mother or the father was said to have sought the divorce, opposed by the other, simply because he or she “grew tired” of the marriage. For both Test cases, more than half the respondents made little or no adjustment to their parenting time allocation, but a substantial minority did, awarding the offending parent significantly less parenting time. While one might guess some respondents would be motivated to punish the adulterous parent, we believe it less likely they would believe it appropriate to punish a spouse who sought to end marriages they no longer found satisfying. Given that there was relatively little difference in our respondents' reactions to the two test cases, we therefore considered explanations, for the responses of those who did reduce parenting time, that could apply equally to both test cases. We suggest two possibilities: 1) they find the behavior in both test cases evidence that the offending parents' commitment to parenting is deficient, since they were willing to risk imposing divorce on their children by their behavior, or 2) a spouse who imposes the burden of parental separation on the children by causing divorce should be penalized, not for the offensiveness of their conduct, but for the harm they caused their children by bringing about the divorce."

Preliminary examination of the test scores of 124 twins with a history of reading difficulties and 154 twins with no history of reading difficulties indicates that over the 5- to 6-year interval between assessments, cognitive and reading performance are highly stable. As a group, those subjects with a history of reading difficulties had substantial deficits relative to control subjects on all measures at initial assessment, and significant deficits remained at follow-up. The stability noted for all cognitive and achievement measures was highest for a composite measure of reading, whose average stability correlation across groups was 0.80. Results of preliminary behavior genetic analyses for this measure indicated that shared genetic influences accounted for 86% and 49% of the phenotypic correlations between the two assessments for twin pairs with and without reading difficulties, respectively.

In this review we integrate these bodies of research and address the interdependent issues of the nature of phonological abilities and their causal roles in the acquisition of reading skills. Phonological ability seems to be general across tasks that purport to measure the three kinds of phonological processing, and this generality apparently is independent of general cognitive ability. However, the generality of phonological ability is not complete, and there is an empirical basis for distinguishing phonological awareness and phonetic recoding in working memory. Our review supports a causal role for phonological awareness in learning to read, and suggests the possibility of similar causal roles for phonological recoding in lexical access and phonetic recoding in working memory. Most researchers have neglected the probable causal role of learning to read in the development of phonological skills. It is no longer enough to ask whether phonological skills play a causal role in the acquisition of reading skills. The question now is which aspects of phonological processing (e.g., awareness, recoding in lexical access, recoding in working memory) are causally related to which aspects of reading (e.g., word recognition, word analysis, sentence comprehension), at which point in their codevelopment, and what are the directions of these causal relations?"

These abilities are characterized by different developmental rates and remarkably stable individual differences. Decoding did not exert a causal influence on subsequent phonological processing abilities, but letter-name knowledge did.

Phonological processing abilities, word-level reading skills, and vocabulary were assessed annually from kindergarten through 4th grade, as the children developed from beginning to skilled readers. Individual differences in phonological awareness were related to subsequent individual differences in word-level reading for every time period examined. Individual differences in serial naming and vocabulary were related to subsequent individual differences in word-level reading initially, but these relations faded with development. Individual differences in letter-name knowledge were related to subsequent individual differences in phonological awareness and serial naming, but there were no relations between individual differences in wordlevel reading and any subsequent phonological processing ability. Phonological processing refers to using the phonological or sound structure of oral language when one processes oral and written language (Jorm & Share, 1983; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987). Spoken words represent combinations of basic sounds or phonemes. In English, for example, there are roughly 30 to 45 basic phonemes, depending on the classification system that is used. Of the nearly infinite number of possible combinations of phonemes, only a relatively small number actually occur, and most combinations of phonemes occur in multiple words. Thus, bat and cat each contain 3 phonemes, the latter 2 of which are shared. This fact is represented by their spellings, which have different initial letters and identical medial and final letters because the spellings in alphabetic orthographies such as English represent sound as well as meaning. Developmental and individual differences in phonological processing abilities appear to be related to the acquisition of reading skills, although the direction, magnitudes, and underlying mechanisms responsible for such relations have yet to be established (Brady & Shankweiler, 1991; Gough, Ehri, & Treiman, 1992; Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1994).

I argue that a disorder is a harmful dysfunction, wherein harmful is a value term based on social norms, and dysfunction is a scientific term referring to the failure of a mental mechanism to perform a natural function for which it was designed by evolution. Thus, the concept of disorder combines value and scientific components. Six other accounts of disorder are evaluated, including the skeptical antipsychiatric view, the value approach, disorder as whatever professionals treat, two scientific approaches (statistical deviance and biological disadvantage), and the operational definition o/clisorder as ""unexpectable distress or disability"" in the revised third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 1987).

However, previous studies have found few connections between traditional measures of text readability and performance on story problems. We hypothesized that recently developed measures of readability and topic incidence measured by text-mining tools may illuminate associations between text difficulty and problem-solving measures. We used data from 3,216 middle and high school students from 10 schools using the Cognitive Tutor Algebra program; these schools were geographically, socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse. We found that several indicators of the readability and topic of story problems were associated with students’ tendency to give correct answers and request hints in Cognitive Tutor. We further examined the individual skill of writing an algebraic expression from a story scenario, and examined students at the lowest performing schools in the sample only, and found additional associations for these subsets. Key readability and topic categories that were related to problem-solving measures included word difficulty, text length, pronoun use, sentence similarity, and topic familiarity. These findings are discussed in the context of models of mathematics story problem solving and previous research on text comprehension. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

Simulations by the model predicted that rats should learn a long monotonic pattern of food quantities better than a nonmonotonic pattern, as predicted by rule-learning theory, and that they should learn a short nonmonotonic pattern with highly discriminable elements better than 1 with less discriminable elements, as predicted by interitem association theory. In 2 other studies, the model also simulated behavioral “rule generalization,” “extrapolation,” and associative transfer data motivated by both rulelearning and associative perspectives. Although these simulations do not rule out the possibility that rats can use rule induction to learn serial patterns, they show that a simple associative model can account for the classical behavioral studies implicating rule learning in reward magnitude serial-pattern learning. One recurring question, almost a leitmotif in the study of comparative cognition, is how best to characterize complex animal behavior. Can a complex sequence of behavior through time, for example, be understood as a complex emanation of simple associative processes? Do putatively complex behaviors demand explanation in terms of higher order cognitive processes? Similarly, in the field of sequential learning, a fundamental question that is not yet fully answered is “What is learned in sequential learning?”"

However, reading speed is not a consistent predictor of text comprehension, when speed and comprehension are measured on the same text within the same reader. This might be due to the somewhat ambiguous nature of reading speed, which is sometimes regarded as a feature of the reading process, and sometimes as a product of that process. We argue that both reading speed and comprehension should be seen as the result of the reading process, and that the process of fluent text reading can instead be described by complexity metrics that quantify aspects of the stability of the reading process. In this article, we introduce complexity metrics in the context of reading and apply them to data from a self-paced reading study. In this study, children and adults read a text silently or aloud and answered comprehension questions after reading. Our results show that recurrence metrics that quantify the degree of temporal structure in reading times yield better prediction of text comprehension compared to reading speed. However, the results for fractal metrics are less clear. Furthermore, prediction of text comprehension is generally strongest and most consistent across silent and oral reading when comprehension scores are normalized by reading speed. Analyses of word length and word frequency indicate that the observed complexity in reading times is not a simple function of the lexical properties of the text, suggesting that text reading might work differently compared to reading of isolated word or sentences."

According to the theory, this effect should exist even for children who are able to name letters accurately. Also implied is a threshold level in letter-naming speed: Below the threshold, variations in letter-naming speed arise primarily from letter-specific faltering that disrupts reading; above it, from processes that are more general, but also less important to reading. Methodologically innovative data on letter-naming speed, object-naming speed, and letternaming accuracy were obtained from kindergarten and second-grade children in two schools. Reading achievement data from the end of the following school year were also obtained. For kindergarten children, but not for second-grade children, letter-naming speed was very strongly associated with subsequent progress in reading. In addition, one measure of later reading achievement had a curved, diminishing-returns relation to kindergarten children's letter-naming speed. The findings are consistent with the theoretical claims above, and inconsistent with several rival interpretations."

Two sets of variables relevant to the examination of job search from a dynamic, self-regulatory perspective—core self-evaluations (T. A. Judge, A. Erez, & J. E. Bono, 1998) and the theory of planned behavior (I. Ajzen, 1991)—were used to guide our examination. Results suggest core self-evaluation is related to average levels of job-search intensity over time. Job-search intentions mediated the relationship between subjective norms and job-search self-efficacy in the prediction of job-search intensity in the following 2 weeks. Both Time 1 and cumulative job-search intensity predict reemployment. This repeated-measures study contributes to research on job search that has been primarily cross-sectional or included few time waves. The understanding of job-search behavior among individuals looking for work has increased during the last 20 years. For example, studies have demonstrated the importance of job-search intensity (how hard individuals look for work; Barron & Mellow, 1981) and job-search methods (the strategies used in the job search; Granovetter, 1995) to job attainment. Other studies have shed light on the characteristics of individuals likely to report higher levels of job-search intensity or to use certain job-search methods (see, e.g., Saks & Ashforth, 1999; Vinokur & Caplan, 1987; Wanberg, Kanfer, & Banas, 2000). Despite the substantial progress made in this literature in the last 20 years, very little is known about job-search persistence (the extent to which job-search intensity continues over time) or how and why individual job searches vary in intensity over time (Barber, Daly, Giannantonio, & Phillips, 1994; Kanfer, Wanberg, & Kantrowitz, 2001; Saks & Ashforth, 2000). Studies on job search have tended to include only one or two time waves of data, prohibiting a strong understanding of changes that occur during the job search and how these changes relate to reemployment. Developing a better understanding of how and why job-search intensity changes over the course of an individual’s unemployment is critical if we are to advance our academic knowledge in this area, as well as if we are to make suggestions about interventions for individuals looking for work. This study used repeatedmeasures methodology to assess the job-search experiences of unemployed job seekers every 2 weeks for a total of 10 time waves (or until reemployment). In doing so, we present the most extensive longitudinal investigation of this topic to date, examining (a) predictors of individual job-search levels over time and (b) the extent to which dynamic data on job search enhance our prediction of reemployment."

Moreover, the CCLS total and 2 subscale scores added significant incremental variance in predicting subjective well-being over and above related constructs.

The children were divided equally into a control group and an experimental group, with the groups matched as closely as possible by age and gender. Children in the experimental group were trained by onset-rime-level phonological training. The training lasted approximately three weeks, with 15 daily sessions lasting approximately 20 minutes each. Our results indicated that children in the experimental group made significant improvements in Chinese character reading, onset awareness, rime awareness, and rapid naming after training. The association between phonological awareness and Chinese character reading, especially the association between rime awareness and Chinese character reading, also changed after training. The benefits of phonological awareness training were more obvious for children younger than ten years old. The results of the present study can be extended to provide another approach to Chinese learning for children suffering from reading difficulties who are not responding to the usual approach in their region."

Half of them were identified as dyslexic, and the other half were typically developing children matched to the dyslexic group by age, gender, and IQ. The interaction of groups of participants and non-alphanumeric rapid naming contributed significantly to Chinese character reading in addition to temporal processing and rapid naming. Moreover, the important role of rapid naming in the contribution of temporal processing to Chinese character reading was found only in children with dyslexia (specific to non-alphanumeric rapid naming). On the contrary, the significant contributions of temporal processing to Chinese character reading without rapid naming were found in children with and without dyslexia.

This study examined the performance of Grade 2 children (8 years old), Grade 3 children (9 years old), and young adults on a task designed to measure their ability to bind visual and auditory–verbal information in working memory. Children’s performance on this task significantly correlated with their word recognition skills even when chronological age, memory for individual elements, and other possible reading-related factors were taken into account. In addition, clear developmental trajectories were observed, with improvements in the ability to hold temporary bound information in working memory between Grades 2 and 3, and between the child and adult groups, that were independent from memory for the individual elements. These findings suggest that the capacity to temporarily bind novel auditory–verbal information to visual form in working memory is linked to the development of word recognition in children and improves with age."

Based on our analysis of prominent reading theories such as the Simple View of Reading (Gough & Tunmer, 1986), the Lexical Quality Hypothesis (Perfetti & Hart, 2002) and the Self-Teaching Hypothesis (Share, 1995), we propose the Decoding Threshold Hypothesis, which posits that the relation between decoding and reading comprehension can only be reliably observed above a certain decoding threshold. In Study 1, the Decoding Threshold Hypothesis was tested in a sample of over 10,000 Grade 5–10 students. Using quantile regression, classification analysis (Receiver Operating Characteristics) and broken-line regression, we found a reliable decoding threshold value below that there was no relation between decoding and reading comprehension, and above which the two measures showed a positive linear relation. Study 2 is a longitudinal analysis of over 30,000 students’ reading comprehension growth as a function of their initial decoding status. Results showed that scoring below the decoding threshold was associated with stagnant growth in reading comprehension. We argue that the Decoding Threshold Hypothesis has the potential to explain differences in the prominent reading theories in terms of the role of decoding in reading comprehension in students at Grade 5 and above. Furthermore, the identification of decoding threshold also has implications for reading practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"

Study 1 (N = 169) demonstrated that considering a recent moral transgression (the manipulation used in Studies 2–5) resulted in lower MSI, regardless of participants’ levels of endorsement of religion-related items. Study 2 (N = 207) showed that following a threat to MSI, religiosity variables predicted heightened negative affect and self-conscious moral emotions. Studies 3 through 5 (combined N = 616) showed that following MSI threats, individuals endorsing intrinsic religiosity and God belief items showed increased prosocial task completion (Studies 3 and 5) and decreased cheating on a word-solving task (Study 4).

The results suggest that the magnitude of arm movement, configuration of the hand, and manner of motion during tool use play a role in determining how tools cluster in action “semantic space”. In Experiment 2, we validated the architecture uncovered in Experiment 1 using an implicit semantic task for which tool use knowledge was not ostensibly relevant (blocked cyclic word-picture matching). Using stimuli from Experiment 1, we found that participants performed more poorly during blocks of trials containing tools used with similar versus unrelated actions, and the amount of semantic interference depended on the magnitude of action similarity among tools.

We re-examined this assumption by reviewing extensive data from the literature and from six samples of our own, in which we collected measures of personality, health and fitness, stress, and current emotional functioning. Results indicate that self-report health measures reflect a pervasive mood disposition of negative affectivity (NA); self-report stress scales also contain a substantial NA component. However, although NA is correlated with health complaint scales, it is not strongly or consistently related to actual, Jong-term health status, and thus will act as a general nuisance factor in health research. Because self-report measures of stress and health both contain a significant NA component, correlations between such measures likely overestimate the true association between stress and health. Results demonstrate the importance of including different types of health measures in health psychology research. Various types of health models have been adopted by clinical, social, and medical researchers. Most of these models assume that psychosocial stressors adversely affect physical health as well as psychological well-being. In recent years, researchers have studied a number of hypothesized precursors of health, including major life changes (e.g., divorce, death of spouse or child; see Holmes & Rahe, 1967; D. H. Schroeder & Costa, 1984), chronic stressors or role strains (e.g., Eckenrode, 1984; Pearlin, Lieberman, Menaghan, &Mullan, 198 I), minor daily stressors or hassles (e.g., DeLongis, Coyne, Dakof, Folkman, &"

However, there are pronounced individual differences in navigation proficiency, which need to be explained and which can illuminate our understanding of cognitive maps and effective navigation.

In Study 1, we found that imprecise navigators have lower spatial and verbal working memory, which may limit their ability to build accurate within-route representations. We also found that integrators maintain excellent memories of buildings as categorized by route membership, possibly supporting the idea of hierarchical representations of the environment. In Study 2, we assessed preferences regarding place and route learning using a virtual version of the rodent T-maze (Marchette, Bakker, & Shelton, 2011). Integrators found more goals overall, and although they did not have an overall preference for a place-based strategy, integrators who did choose a place-based strategy found more goals. The opposite was true for imprecise navigators. In Study 3, we added a monetary incentive for accuracy to evaluate whether increased motivation leads to fewer participants classified as imprecise, but found no significant change in the distribution of performance.

The aim of the Sing Up Programme is to provide all primary-aged children (up to the age of 11 years) with opportunities for singing under high quality vocal leadership both within their school curriculum and outside of school on a regular basis. As part of the evaluation, members of the research team visited 81 schools across England, and assessed the singing behavior and development of 3,762 individual children using the combination of two established rating scales. The focus was on providing an initial profile of children's singing prior to the launch of the National Programme and, subsequently later in the first year, to conduct a small number of additional visits to see if there was any evidence of early impact. The results confirm that children's singing is subject to developmental processes, with variations related to sex, age and ethnicity. There is also some evidence that, notwithstanding such variations, a programme of sustained singing education can have a positive benefit on children's singing behaviors and development. KEYWORDS - children's singing development, Sing Up INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Research suggests that singing behaviors are subject to developmental processes in which individual neuropsychobiological potentiality is shaped (nurtured and/or hindered) by learning experiences within sociocultural contexts (Knight, 2010; Welch, 2007, 2011). Although singing is commonplace, it is also marked by cultural diversity, with development related to opportunity (e.g., Mang, 2007), the prosodie features of indigenous languages (Azechi, 2008), as well as the dominant characteristics of the local musical soundscapes (Welch, 2006a, 2006b, 2011; Welch, Sergeant, & White, 1997). In many parts of the world, the ability to sing is a mark of an individual's underlying musicality (cf. Sloboda, Wise, & Peretz, 2005). Consequently, those individuals whose singing development has been hindered in some way are often labelled (including self-labelled) in some absolutist sense under a bipolar categorization of 'can'/'cannot' sing, with variations in their ascribed musical identity as a 'non-singer', 'tone-deaf', or 'tone-dumb' being found in virtually all cultures. Yet, as mentioned above, contrary evidence from developmental and neurological studies continues to emerge that singing and musical behaviors are context bound and susceptible to improvement with appropriate experience which can be informal as well as formal (e.g., Brown, Martinez, Hodges, Fox, & Parsons, 2004; Dalla Bella, Giguere, & Peretz 2007; Fuchs et al., 2007; Kleber, Veit, Birbaumer, & Lotze, 2007; Koelsch, Fritz, Schulze, Alsop, & Schlaug, 2005; Mang, 2006, 2007; Mithen & Parsons, 2008; Stewart & Williamen, 2008; Welch et al., 2008; see Welch, 2006a for review). Furthermore, the recent wealth of studies into the neurosciences and music (cf. Avanzini, Faienza, Minciacchi, Lopez, & Majno, 2003; Avanzini, Koelsch, Lopez, & Majno, 2005) continue to amass evidence of the multi-sited representation of musical behaviors in various regions of the brain, including singing (Kleber et al., 2007). These and related studies also indicate that there are various other-than-musical benefits that can accrue for the individual from engaging in musical (including singing) activity, such as related to physical and psychological health and well-being (Clift & Hancox, 2001; Clift et al., 2007; Kreutz, Bongard, Rohrmann, Hodapp, & Grebe, 2004; Welch, 2005), social skill development and social inclusion (Odena, 2007; Portowitz, Lichtenstein, Egorova, & Brand, 2009) and cognitive development (Schlaug, Norton, Overy, & Winner, 2005). Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that music is figuring more significantly in the contemporary educational policies of several of the world's governments. …"

Numerous hypotheses, including causal relevance, linkage to the specific case, and fairness to the defendant proved inadequate to explain the data. For evidence to affect decisions, the evidence must do more than affect people's perceptions about the probabilities associated with the ultimate fact; people seem to require that suppositions regarding the ultimate fact affect their perceptions of the truth or falsity of the evidence."

After baseline recall and assessment of beliefs, participants were assigned to goal-setting, goals plus feedback, or control. Then, additional recall trials were followed by repeated memory beliefs assessments. For both younger and older adults, performance, motivation, and selfefficacy were affected positively by goal-setting. The impact of goals plus feedback was mixed and varied as a function of age and dependent measure. Success rates for reaching memory goals, which were low for the older adults, may have been a factor in these results. Adults' self-set recall goals were predicted initially by baseline performance and self-efficacy. On the final trial, goals were predicted by last trial performance, self-efficacy, and control beliefs. Self-regulatory processes have been examined in association with social learning theory (Bandura, 1997), goal theory (Locke & Latham, 1990), attribution theory (Weiner, 1985), and self theories (Dweck, 1999). Such processes can play an important role in performance maintenance and enhancement. In spite of their potential importance, some aspects of self-regulato ry control have been investigated infrequently in the domain of cognition. Because cognitive performance across the lifespan is typically viewed as a function of basic intellectual ability and specific cognitive skills, investigation of self-regulato ry processes such as strategies and performance monitoring has been common. These are directly related to performance. In contrast, effort, motivation, efficacy, implicit theories, and attributions reflect processes only indirectly related to cognitive skills, and their influence on cognition was largely ignored until recently. Cognitive aging researchers are now clearly interested in self-regulatory factors such as attributions and self-efficacy (e.g., Cavanaugh, Feldman, & Hertzog, 1998; Hertzog & Dixon, 1994; Lachman, 1991; Welch & West, 1995). The purpose of this investigation is to further extend this line of research into the arena of goal theory.

This bias is termed the causal asymmetry. Evidence for this bias is reviewed in several domains, including visual impressions of causal relations, reasoning about Newton's third law in naive physics problems, concepts underlying linguistic expressions of causality, and research in causal judgment from contingency information. Although there might be an equivalent to the causal asymmetry in the domain of social causality, there are too many uncertainties in the evidence for conclusions to be drawn."

It is proposed that property transmission becomes a general and readily available hypothesis used to make interpretations and judgments about causal questions under conditions of uncertainty, in which property transmission functions as a heuristic. The property transmission hypothesis explains why and when similarity information is used in causal inference. It can account for magical contagion beliefs, some cases of illusory correlation, the correspondence bias, overestimation of cross-situational consistency in behavior, nonregressive tendencies in prediction, the belief that acts of will are causes of behavior, and a range of other phenomena. People learn that property transmission is often moderated by other factors, but under conditions of uncertainty in which the operation of relevant other factors is unknown, it tends to exhibit a pervasive influence on thinking about causality."

amount of supportive evidence is better interpreted as effects of specific processing
mechanisms, not as showing general temporal integration. The evidence shows that temporal
integration occurs on multiple time scales and no particular duration is special, and that
windows of temporal integration are defined in terms of information density, not in terms of
duration. The subjective present is constructed through local temporal integration on multiple
time scales, further integrated into a coherent global representation of what is going on."

However, few studies have examined skilled reading in schizophrenia (e.g., Arnott, Sali, Copland, 2011; Hayes & O'Grady, 2003; Revheim et al., 2006; E. O. Roberts et al., 2012), and none have examined the contribution of cognitive and motor processes that underlie reading performance. Thus, to evaluate the relationship of linguistic processes and oculomotor control to skilled reading in schizophrenia, 20 individuals with schizophrenia and 16 demographically matched controls were tested using a moving window paradigm (McConkie & Rayner, 1975). Linguistic skills supporting reading (phonological awareness) were assessed with the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (R. K. Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1999). Eye movements were assessed during reading tasks and during nonlinguistic tasks tapping basic oculomotor control (prosaccades, smooth pursuit) and executive functions (predictive saccades, antisaccades). Compared with controls, schizophrenia patients exhibited robust oculomotor markers of reading difficulty (e.g., reduced forward saccade amplitude) and were less affected by reductions in window size, indicative of reduced perceptual span. Reduced perceptual span in schizophrenia was associated with deficits in phonological processing and reduced saccade amplitudes. Executive functioning (antisaccade errors) was not related to perceptual span but was related to reading comprehension. These findings suggest that deficits in language, oculomotor control, and cognitive control contribute to skilled reading deficits in schizophrenia. Given that both language and oculomotor dysfunction precede illness onset, reading may provide a sensitive window onto cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia vulnerability and be an important target for cognitive remediation."

W. A. Whittlesea & L. D. Williams, 2001), surprising violation of an expectation was observed to cause an illusion of familiarity. The authors interpreted that evidence as support for the discrepancy-attribution hypothesis. This article extended the scope of that hypothesis, investigating the consequences of surprising validation of expectations. Subjects were shown recognition probes as completions of sentence stems. Their expectations were manipulated by presenting predictive, nonpredictive, and inconsistent stems. Predictive stems caused an illusion of familiarity, but only when the subjects also experienced uncertainty about the outcome. That is, as predicted by the discrepancyattribution hypothesis, feelings of familiarity occurred only when processing of a recognition target caused surprise. The article provides a discussion of the ways in which a perception of discrepancy can come about, as well as the origin and nature of unconscious expectations. Memory has two primary functions: the production of responses to stimuli and the evaluation of the quality of those responses (Whittlesea, 1997; Whittlesea & Leboe, 2000). The production function provides people with information about the world and appropriate responses; the evaluation function is the source of subjective reactions to that information. The experiments of this article investigate the evaluation process, tracing a chain of inference and attribution that leads from the initial perception of a word in a meaningful context to a feeling of familiarity for that word. People are chronically involved in constructing percepts and cognitions about their environment. They encounter stimuli in various contexts and for various purposes; those contexts and purposes cause people to impose different organizations and interpretations on the stimuli.

In 2 preliminary experiments, using an immediate probe recognition task, the authors replicated previous findings of inhibition for nonreferents following categorical anaphors. In Experiments 1-3, naming times to nonreferent probes were inhibited, but only at a delay and at the end of the sentence. Eye movements were monitored in Experiment 4, and reading times were found to be slower in end-of-sentence regions following the remention of the nonreferent but not on the nonreferent itself. These results suggest that decreases in nonreferent accessibility are due to postanaphoric processes, such as integrating the nonreferent into the discourse structure, and are not due to more immediate changes in activation occurring as part of the resolution process. Further, some inhibition effects may result from the use of probe tasks that require decisions."

Recently, theorists have sought to reconcile these views by acknowledging the role of both associative and inferential processes, and the current investigation drew upon recent social-cognitive research to test this compromise. Individual differences in hostile inferences and associations were assessed in an implicit cognitive paradigm, and relevant outcomes were assessed in a daily diary protocol. Implicit hostile inferences predicted both anger and aggression in daily life, and such relationships were mediated by propensities toward hostile interpretations in daily life. Hostile associations also predicted anger in daily life, but this relationship proved to be independent of daily hostile interpretations. Results therefore support a model that acknowledges the role of both associative and appraisal processes in anger elicitation."

We suggest that the more people approach such tasks in a ""rational"" (i.e., consistent, algorithmic) manner, relative to those who use more variable or ad hoc approaches, the more confident they become, irrespective of whether they are reaching correct judgments. In 6 studies, participants completed tests involving logical reasoning, intuitive physics, or financial investment. Those more consistent in their approach to the task rated their performances more positively, including those consistently pursuing the wrong rule. Indeed, completely consistent but wrong participants thought almost as highly of their performance as did completely consistent and correct participants. Participants were largely aware of the rules they followed and became more confident in their performance when induced to be more systematic in their approach, no matter how misguided that approach was. In part, the link between decision consistency and (over)confidence was mediated by a neglect of alternative solutions as participants followed a more uniform approach to a task.

Sixty-Four children, aged between 8 years 9 months and 11 years 9 months, took part in a battery of writing, reading, and cognitive ability tasks. Reading fluency emerged as having a strong relationship to written language performance, after controlling for age and verbal reasoning. While children with reading difficulties were weak at spelling accuracy, they were otherwise found to produce written compositions of similar quality to typical readers. Boys produced less written text than girls, but did not demonstrate weaker written language abilities. Collectively the results demonstrate that writing skills can be separated into transcription and composition processes, and highlight the need for further research on the relationship between reading fluency and children's writing."

Despite its importance, IER’s psychological structure remains poorly understood. We propose that two key dimensions describe IER: (a) individuals’ tendency to pursue IER in response to emotional events, and (b) the efficacy with which they perceive IER improves their emotional lives. To probe these dimensions, we developed the Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ), a valid and reliable measure of individual differences in IER. Factor analyses of participants’ responses confirmed tendency and efficacy as independent dimensions of IER (Study 1; N = 285), and demonstrated independence between how individuals engage with IER in response to negative, versus positive, emotion. In Study 2 (N = 347), we found that individuals high in IER tendency and efficacy are more emotionally expressive, empathetic, and socially connected. Two subsequent studies highlighted behavioral consequences of IER dimensions: people high in IER tendency sought out others more often following experimentally induced emotion (Study 3; N = 400), and individuals high in IER efficacy benefitted more from social support after real-world emotional events (Study 4; N = 787). Finally, a field study of social networks in freshman dormitories revealed that individuals high in IER tendency and efficacy developed more supportive relationships during the first year of college (Study 5; N = 193). These data (a) identify distinct dimensions underlying IER, (b) demonstrate that these dimensions can be stably measured and separated from related constructs, and (c) reveal their implications for relationships and well-being.

Some studies have reported gender differences favouring girls in reading comprehension in South Africa, but little systematic evidence exists about gender differences in the cognitive-linguistic abilities that underlie reading development. This study investigated the effect of gender on phonological processing and reading development in Northern Sotho–English bilingual children. Grade 3 learners who received their literacy instruction in English were tested on various phonological processing and reading measures. Phonological awareness was assessed using phoneme isolation and elision tasks. Phonological working memory was assessed using memory for digits and non-word repetition tests while rapid automatised naming was tested using rapid letter, rapid digit, rapid object and rapid colour naming tasks. Reading achievement was assessed with various word reading tasks and with a fluent reading task. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed that gender had a significant effect on the phonological processing and reading abilities of Northern Sotho– English bilingual children. Girls performed significantly better than boys on all the reading measures, as well as on some aspects of phonological processing. The findings provide behavioural evidence in support of biological theories of gender differences, in that girls seemed to have developed some of the cognitive-linguistic skills associated with reading before boys. The girls also coped better with tasks that required increased cognitive processing. This study suggests that sex differences in reading development cannot be ignored in South Africa and need to be addressed in future curriculum development."

It was found that German dyslexic children suffered from a pervasive speed deficit for all types of reading tasks, including text, high frequency words, and pseudowords, but at the same time showed generally rather high reading accuracy. For pseudowords, reading refusals or word responses were absent, and the majority of errors was close to the target pronunciation. Reading speed seemed to be most impaired for pseudowords and function words that did not allow the children to take a short-cut from phonemically mediated word processing. The discussion offers a developmental framework for the interpretation of these reading difficulties. For the cognitive tasks, dyslexic children did not differ from age-matched control children on the pseudoword repetition task or the digit span task, indicating that auditory perception and memory were not impaired. On phonological awareness tasks (rhyme oddity detection, vowel substitution, and pseudoword spelling), dyslexic children scored lower than age-matched control children, but not lower than younger reading-level control children. The performance of the dyslexic children on the phonemic segmentation tasks (pseudoword spelling and vowel substitution) was high in absolute terms. In contrast, marked differences between dyslexic and age-matched controls were found on rapid naming tasks: dyslexic grade 4 children showed lower numeral-naming speed than reading-level grade 2 children. Numeral-naming speed turned out to be the most important predictor of reading speed differences. These findings are discussed in relation to the phonological impairment explanation of dyslexia and to recent alternative explanations that posit an underlying impairment in automatizing skills which demand the fast execution of low-level cognitive processes."

These dissociations were expected because German exhibits high regularity in the direction of graphemes to phonemes (forward regularity) but not in the direction of phonemes to graphemes (backward regularity). High forward regularity allows reliance on phonological processing in reading (even in advanced fluent reading), whereas low backward regularity requires reliance on orthographic memory representations in spelling. Dysfluent reading in the absence of spelling difficulties was associated only with a naming speed deficit—assessed at school entrance— but not with phonological memory or phonological awareness deficits. In contrast, a specific spelling deficit was preceded by phonological deficits. In orthographies with regular grapheme–phoneme relations, difficulties in learning to read take another form than they do in English. In English, the typical problem of children who are dyslexic is to read correctly unfamiliar words, whereas in more regular orthographies, the typical problem is to read fluently. To illustrate, in Landerl, Wimmer, and Frith’s (1997) comparative study, a majority of the 11-year-old English children who were dyslexic had a problem with the word character. Some children refused to read it and others produced misreadings ranging from chancelor and calendar to nonwords such as tshraekter. In contrast, the German children who were dyslexic for the close to identical word Charakter produced few misreadings (all nonwords), but their reading time was between 2 and 3 times higher than that of their peers who read normally. The massive reading fluency impairment of German children who were dyslexic in the context of relatively few errors (even under speed instruction) has been obtained in several studies (Klicpera & Schabmann, 1993;"

Quite different from findings with English-speaking children, phonological awareness deficits did not affect phonological coding in word recognition but did affect orthographic spelling and foreign-word reading. Naming-speed deficits did affect reading fluency, orthographic spelling, and foreign-word reading. Apparently, in the context of a regular orthography and a synthetic phonics teaching approach, early phases of literacy acquisition (particularly the acquisition of phonological coding) are less affected by early phonological awareness deficits than are later phases that depend on the build up of orthographic memory. The double-deficit hypothesis was developed by Maryanne Wolf and Patricia Bowers as an extension of the dominant phonological-deficit explanation of developmental dyslexia (e.g., Bowers & Wolf, 1993; Wolf & Bowers, 1999). The phonologicaldeficit hypothesis postulates an early difficulty in acquiring phonological awareness, which interferes with the acquisition of grapheme-phoneme coding as a word recognition mechanism, which in turn results in reduced self-teaching of orthographic word representations (Share, 1995). The early problem with phonological awareness is seen as resulting from less sharp phoneme boundaries in speech perception (Fowler, 1991) or from less distinct phonological word representations (Elbro & Peterson, 1998). The double-deficit hypothesis acknowledges the phonological awareness deficit of dyslexic children but stresses a deficit in naming speed as a second and equally important cause of reading difficulties. The first demonstration that dyslexic children show impaired naming speed was provided by Denckla and Rudel (1976), whose Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) Test became the standard assessment of naming speed. In the RAN test, a large array of repeatedly presented, well-known visual patterns (pictured objects, color patches, digits) has to be named as quickly as possible. Wolf, Bally, and Morris (1986) were the In:st to show that early differences in rapid naming are predictive of later reading difficulties. The double-deficit hypothesis is based on findings (reviewed by Wolf & Bowers, 1999) showing that, typically, there are only modest correlations between phonological awareness measures and RAN performance in groups of dyslexic children and that dyslexic children as a group exhibit both phonological awareness deficits and naming-speed deficits. From these findings,"

An only limited causal role of phonological deficits (phonological awareness, phonological STM, and rapid naming) for the emergence of reading fluency and spelling deficits is inferred from two large longitudinal studies with assessments of phonology before learning to read. A review of our cross-sectional studies provides no support for several cognitive deficits (visual–attention deficit, magnocellular dysfunction, skill automatization deficit, and visual–sequential memory deficit), which were proposed as alternatives to the phonological deficit account. Finally, a revised version of the phonological deficit account in terms of a dysfunction in orthographic–phonological connectivity is proposed. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Yet little research exists to guide them, for history has been virtually ignored by researchers interested in cognition and instruction. The present study explored how people evaluate primary and secondary sources when considering questions of historical evidence. A group of working historians and high school seniors ""thought aloud"" as they reviewed a series of written and pictorial documents about the Battle of Lexington. Differences were found in how each group reasoned about historical evidence. It is suggested that these differences are due in part to beliefs that frame the act of historical inquiry. Over 70 years ago J. Carleton Bell asked in the pages of this journal: ""What is the historic sense? How can it be developed? These are questions in which the educational psychologist is interested and which it is incumbent upon him to answer"" (1917, p. 317). In the years since Bell asked these questions, we have witnessed an explosion of research on school learning. This explosion, part of the ""cognitive revolution"" in psychology (Gardner, 1985), has shed light on students' thinking in such areas as arithmetic (Nesher & Katriel, 1977; Resnick, 1982), algebra (Sleeman, 1984), geometry (Greeno, Magone, & Chaiklin, 1979), biology (Carey, 1985), physics (diSessa, 1985; McCloskey, 1983), and computer science (Sleeman, Putnam, Baxter, & Kuspa, 1986).

We propose the coalitional value theory (CVT) of antigay bias to explain this pattern. The CVT argues that men evolved psychological systems to facilitate coalitional formation and regulation and that these systems may lead to antigay bias because men perceive gay men as possessing lower coalitional value for traditionally male coalitions. We tested the CVT in 4 studies. In Study 1, gay men were perceived as less masculine than straight men and as less competent at traditionally masculine activities. In Studies 2 and 3, masculine gay men were rated as more competent than and chosen over feminine straight men in traditionally masculine activities. In Study 4, actual coalitional contribution predicted men’s perceptions of other men’s derogation more than did sexual orientation. We also found that men’s preferences for masculinity diminished in nontraditionally masculine tasks such as poetry, suggesting that men’s assessments are contingent upon the nature of the task. This offers a possible palliative for antigay bias: coalitional pluralism, which we discuss."

For example, faces are rated as more attractive and trustworthy when they have more smiling features and also more female features. However, the influence of facial features on evaluations should be qualified by the affective consequences of fluency (cognitive ease) with which such features are processed. Further, fluency (along with its affective consequences) should depend on whether the current task highlights conflict between specific features. Four experiments are presented. In 3 experiments, participants saw faces varying in expressions ranging from pure anger, through mixed expression, to pure happiness. Perceivers first categorized faces either on a control dimension, or an emotional dimension (angry/happy). Thus, the emotional categorization task made “pure” expressions fluent and “mixed” expressions disfluent. Next, participants made social evaluations. Results show that after emotional categorization, but not control categorization, targets with mixed expressions are relatively devalued. Further, this effect is mediated by categorization disfluency. Additional data from facial electromyography reveal that on a basic physiological level, affective devaluation of mixed expressions is driven by their objective ambiguity. The fourth experiment shows that the relative devaluation of mixed faces that vary in gender ambiguity requires a gender categorization task. Overall, these studies highlight that the impact of facial features on evaluation is qualified by their fluency, and that the fluency of features is a function of the current task. The discussion highlights the implications of these findings for research on emotional reactions to ambiguity."

Of particular interest to the current study are that vowels can precede the consonant in writing but follow it in speech, hence a mismatch between the spoken and written sequence occurs, for example Open image in new window ‘flat’ is spoken as /bɛ:n/ or in a more severely misaligned example where the vowel operates across syllables the word Open image in new window ‘insect’ is spoken as /m(a)lɛ:ŋ/. In order to investigate if there is a processing cost associated with this discrepancy between spoken and written sequence for vowels and the implications this has in relation to the grain size used when reading Thai, eye movements of adults reading words with and without misaligned vowels in sentences using the EyeLink II tracking system was conducted.

Most studies to date have tended to rely on parent report of family functioning despite evidence that parent report, particularly when it comes to asthma care, may be biased. For example, parents have been found to overestimate their children’s adherence to medications and asthma control (Dozier, Aligne, & Schlabacher, 2006). Thus, gaining perspectives from multiple family members is crucial to obtaining a full understanding of family functioning as it relates to pediatric asthma (McQuaid, Walders, Kopel, Fritz, & Klinnert, 2005).

Reports from multiple family members provide a richer understanding of family context, and children may be a particularly valuable source of information about their own perceptions of illness and its management within the family. However, children younger than 10 years of age are often neglected as sources of information for asthma-related family characteristics because of limitations in self-report measures for young children. Although it may be challenging to elicit child reports of complex family interaction and illness-response patterns through standard self-report measures, we propose that child narrative story stem completion tasks are an important way of assessing children’s perceptions of the meaning that asthma has for them. Indeed, story stems have been used to elicit self-reports of psychopathology that might not otherwise be accessible from children (Oppenheim, 2006). Story stems evoke open narrative responses that allow a deeper understanding of the meaning a child gives to events and relationships (Fiese & Spagnola, 2005; Yoshikawa, Weisner, Kalil, & Way, 2008). Narrative techniques offer an especially rich opportunity to assess child perceptions of various threats, and the availability of security and safety from the family in times of threat (Oppenheim, 2006).

There were three primary aims of this study. First, we conceptualized asthma as a salient threat to children’s emotional security and examined children’s narrative responses to both general and asthma-specific story stems. Second, we tested the direct links between asthma severity (as tested by objective pulmonary function test and by parent report) and children’s (a) internalizing and externalizing symptoms, (b) depictions of family involvement and relationship expectations in their responses to story stems pertaining to general family routine events, and (c) emotional security portrayed in their narrative completions of asthma-specific story stems. Based on previous research, we expected greater asthma severity to be related to greater internalizing (but not necessarily externalizing) symptoms, and children’s representations reflecting less security and trust in the family. Third, we tested a hypothesized indirect path by which greater asthma severity would be associated with greater internalizing symptoms through child representations of family relationships and involvement and their own emotional security."

Additionally, various classification criteria are frequently implemented to classify children with MD. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the PA and RAN skills in children who met different criteria for RD only and children with RD who are at risk for mathematics difficulties (MDR). Participants were 114 second- or third-grade students with RD from public elementary schools in three large metropolitan areas. Students were classified as at risk for mathematics difficulties utilizing a 25th-percentile cutoff and a 15th-percentile cutoff as assessed by the KeyMath-Revised Test (Connolly, 1988). A series of PA and RAN measures were administered along with a range of reading and mathematics measures.

Participants were first asked to practice imitating sung or spoken sequences, and then to imitate a new sequence, which could differ with respect to domain (speaking or singing), global pitch contour (question vs. statement pattern), and/or words. Pitch accuracy during transfer was affected by changes to domain and contour, but not text. Somewhat surprisingly, best transfer was found either when both domain and contour remained the same or both changed. Transfer performance suffered when only one feature changed and the other remained consistent. Analyses of individual differences showed that poor-pitch imitators had a harder time adopting the pitch structure of new sequences, regardless of whether the sequence was speech or song. Results were not consistent with claims for either independence or complete integration of music and language, but instead argue for differences in domain possibly based on the salience of pitch structures in the signal.Keywords: vocal imitation, imitation learning, poor-pitch singers, generalization(ProQuest: ... denotes formula omitted.)Debate concerning the systems underlying music and language has centered around the processing of pitch. The influential modular model of Peretz and Coltheart (2003) focuses on processing of pitch as a critical difference between the domains. Specifically, this model predicts that pitch information within a musical context (e.g., in song) is processed by a tonal encoding module independent of spoken pitch. Other accounts, here termed integrationist, propose that pitch is processed similarly in both speech and musical contexts (e.g., Koelsch, 2011; Koelsch & Seibel, 2005). For instance, Koelsch and Siebel (2005; see also Koelsch, 2011) propose that the extraction of meaning from pitch and timbre occurs in similar modules for speech and music. Similarly, several auditory scene analysis models (e.g., Bregman, 1990; Patterson, Allerhand, & Giguere, 1995; Yost, 2007) propose that the perception of speech and music is formed by the same set of computations.The validity of independence versus integrationist accounts for pitch perception in music and language continues to be a source of debate. However, our perspective has to do with the ability to produce pitch patterns by imitation. Two points motivate this focus. First, research in both music and language cognition is dominated by perception as opposed to production, leaving open to question whether similar effects found in perception research also hold for production. Second, research has suggested that some individuals exhibit a production-specific musical pitch deficit, here termed poor-pitch singing (Pfordresher & Brown, 2007; Roberts & Davies, 1975; Welch, 1979), that may exist in the absence of any perceptual deficit such as congenital amusia (Peretz et al., 2002). Both points led us to explore whether the imitative production of speech incorporates a pitch processing system that is distinct from the imitative production of song.Independent Versus Integrationist Views of Music and LanguageModels of music and language processing can be said to fall along a continuum bracketed by the extreme views of full independence and complete integration. A fully independent view, following Fodor's description of modularity (Fodor, 1983, 2000), conceptualizes speech processing as comprising a distinct (domain specific) set of processing modules that are not shared with music processing, and furthermore are not influenced by information processing that occurs within the music system (information encapsulation). A similar set of constraints should exist for music processing. One view that approximates this approach, though focusing on domain specificity rather than encapsulation, is the aforementioned model of Peretz and Coltheart (2003). With respect to pitch processing-whether in perception or production-a fully independent view would predict that constraints or benefits associated with pitch processing in one domain (e. …"

Students were either randomly assigned to an experimental condition, using argumentative schemes and critical questions as guides during discussions, or to a comparison condition in which a traditional set of questions was used to guide discussions. Students in both conditions read the same historical controversies and used the same text structure heuristic to better compare reading and writing outcomes after students participated in discussion. The findings after instruction indicate comparable reading comprehension and comparable composing skill on general writing measures across conditions. Importantly, the findings also indicate disciplinary benefits for students in the experimental condition in terms of their ability to learn historical content and regarding the quality of students’ historical reasoning in their written arguments. Argument schemes and critical questions appeared particularly helpful in facilitating students’ substantiation of claims and development of rebuttals.

Using functional analysis, this study predicted a positivity bias for moderately evaluated information and a negativity bias for extremely evaluated information. Content domain (competence vs. morality) and evaluative extremity produced main effects in a 2 x 2 experiment where 108 Ss were provided with descriptions of negative and positive behaviors of fictitious targets. As expected, the negativity effect in the morality domain was strong for extremely evaluated information but weak or nonexistent for moderately evaluated information. In contrast, the positivity effect in the competence domain was stronger for moderately than for extremely evaluated information. We suggest that positive and negative evaluations serve as approach and avoidance cues in interpersonal perception. The border between good and evil is located within rather than between persons: Usually, the same person shows both positive and negative attributes. An exception may be characters in the trivial literature, but this literature is considered trivial exactly because it is populated with ""black"" and ""white"" characters. According to the well-known averaging model of information integration (N. H. Anderson, 1981), observers' impressions of a person should be neutral if this person shows the same number of positive and negative attributes, each to the same extent. Numerous studies reveal, however, that even if the relative number of positive and negative attributes is controlled and balanced, negative impressions tend to emerge (e.g., Birnbaum, 1973; Fiske, 1980; Oden & Anderson, 1971; Reeder & Coovert, 1986; Reeder & Spores, 1983; Roskey & Birnbaum, 1974; Van der Pligt & Eiser, 1980; Warr, 1974). This suggests that negative information, even if equal in extremity to positive information, is given more weight in information integration, thus yielding a negativity effect. This effect has been explained in terms of the relative novelty of negative information (Fiske, 1980), its lower ambiguity (Birnbaum, 1972; Wyer, 1973), or its greater discrepancy with the general positivity of the typical or average person (Simpson & Ostrom, 1976).

The first section reviews findings from both neuropsychological and reading research on letter-naming and general naming speed, and analyzes the methodological differences between discrete-trial and continuous naming formats. The findings taken together suggest that the relations between subprocesses change both with development and as the cognitive requirements for naming and reading tasks become more differentiated. Findings from a number of studies also suggest the existence of a naming-rate deficit that differentiates dyslexic from average and garden-variety poor readers; this deficit appears to persist well into middle childhood. The second section speculates more broadly about whether the relations between naming and reading deficits are causal or associative, and also about associations between deficits in naming speed and deficits in motoric speed. These associations could be explained by the existence of a connector variable common to some processes in both language and motoric domains, such as a hypothesized precise timing mechanism that may inhibit the ability of some dyslexic readers to achieve rapid processing."

We now feel comfortable endorsing the use of these scores in some applied and research settings. Second, we conducted new meta-analyses (k = 44) for the 4 noncognitive Rorschach scores with highest validity in the Mihura et al. FINDINGS. Unlike Mihura et al., we included unpublished dissertations (although we did not attempt to exhaustively unearth all unpublished studies), calculated correlations instead of semipartial correlations, and used the Rorschach International Norms for a larger proportion of comparisons. Our validity estimates for the Suicide Constellation and Weighted Sum of Color were similar to or even higher than those of Mihura et al., although we concluded that support for the Suicide Constellation is limited and that Weighted Sum of Color probably does not measure its intended target. Our validity estimates for Sum Shading and the Anatomy and X-ray score were much lower than those of Mihura et al. We conclude that their meta-analysis accurately reflects the published literature, but their exclusion of unpublished studies led to substantial overestimates of validity for some and perhaps many Rorschach scores.

Latent growth curve modeling suggested that fathers were likely to increase their relative contribution to child caregiving over the course of 3 years when they had a greater proportion of male children in the family and when life events—particularly changes in employment and financial status—were experienced by the family. Although mothers were responsible for more of the caregiving, their relative level of involvement tended to decrease when there were no young children in the family. Two-parent families may adapt to varying family contexts and life circumstances by shifting caregiving roles and responsibilities over the course of years. In recent years, considerable attention has been focused on the involvement of fathers with their children (Marsiglio, Amato, Day, & Lamb, 2000). Although numerous studies have identified cross-sectional correlates of paternal involvement in caregiving (e.g., Bonney, Kelley, & Levant, 1999), few have focused on the factors related to change in father involvement over time. Family relationships are not static; they are influenced by numerous contextual factors that change with the passage of time. In this study, a model of change in the perceived child-care involvement of fathers and mothers in two-parent families was tested with latent growth curve modeling. We define involvement as the proportion of total child care performed by each parent. The goal was to investigate factors that promote (or discourage) paternal and maternal caregiving involvement.

We used the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 dataset. Participants included 14,106 sophomores across 684 public and private schools. We identified variables of interest based on previous research on dropout and implemented hierarchical generalized linear modeling. In the final model, significant student-level predictors included academic achievement, retention, sex, family socioeconomic status (SES), and extracurricular involvement. Significant school-level predictors included school SES and school size.

Results from a correlational analysis of 73 4- and 5-year-olds revealed a significant association between VisD and letter identification abilities, which was not moderated by estimated nonverbal or verbal abilities or lexical access. Stronger VisD abilities also were positively associated with better phonemic awareness skills, presumably because of the association between letter knowledge and phonemic skills, or letter-sound correspondence. A pilot study explored the benefit of visual discrimination training of letter-like forms to letter learning for a subset of 28 children with below average lowercase letter identification abilities. Only letter-name training significantly impacted lowercase letter identification; visual discrimination training did not further enhance performance.

Experiment 1 revealed that both the imageability effect and the ambiguity advantage seen in the speeded naming task are confined to words with atypical mappings between spelling and sound. Nonetheless, it is possible that either of these effects may arise from the operation of the direct rather than the semantic pathway. Experiment 2 therefore included nonword fillers in order to minimize semantic reliance during speeded naming. This manipulation removed the imageability effect, indicating a semantic locus, but the ambiguity advantage remained, suggesting a nonsemantic locus. These results are considered in the context of computational models that incorporate a semantic level of representation."

We document this shift across a variety of activities (exercising, visiting a museum, and lab tasks) and using various measures, including rated importance of intrinsic incentives inside and outside pursuit, actual and planned persistence on activities that offer these incentives, and regret when choosers outside pursuit forgo intrinsic incentives that pursuers later seek. This shift in valuation occurs because intrinsic incentives improve the experience during action pursuit, and therefore, this shift is unique to intrinsic incentives.

Each family member provided a history of sleeping arrangements, 1 week of continuous activity records, and details of each sleep event. Sleep records documented late-onset and dispersed sleep patterns with extensive cosleeping. Of recorded sleep events, 69% involved cosleeping, 24% included more than 1 cosleeper, and only 21% were solitary. Mid–late afternoon napping occurred on 31% of days, and night sleep onsets averaged after midnight. Age and gender structured sleep arrangements and, together with locale, extensively explained sleep behavior (onset, duration, total) and quality. Cosleepers had fewer night arousals, shorter and less variable night sleep duration, and less total sleep. Increased solitary sleep in adolescents and young adults was associated with increased sleep dysregulation, including exaggerated phase shifts in males and more nighttime arousals in females. Where normative, cosleeping may provide psychosensory stimuli that moderate arousal and stabilize sleep. Such moderating features may address important self-regulatory developmental needs during adolescence."

The authors show the same interaction with immediate auditory naming. The interaction disappeared with a delayed auditory naming control experiment, suggesting that it has a perceptual basis. In an attempt to separate input (signal to ear) from output (brain to muscle) processes in word recognition, the authors ran 2 auditory perceptual identification experiments. The interaction was again significant, but performance was best for words high on both danger and usefulness. This suggests that initial demonstrations of the interaction were reflecting an output approach/withdraw response conflict induced by stimuli that are both dangerous and useful.

START,START,2124393937,the comprehension and validation of social information,1999,"robert s wyer, gabriel a radvansky",psychological review,1,119,147,"The information one acquires in daily life concerns specific people and events about which one has prior knowledge. A theory of social cognition is proposed to account for the comprehension and verification of such information. The theory views comprehension as a process of constructing situation models of new information on the basis of previously formed models about its referents. The theory specifies the conditions in which statements about familiar people and events (e.g., ""Jane Fonda does aerobics"") are spontaneously recognized as true or false in the process of comprehending them. It further specifies the conditions in which these spontaneous validity judgments of a statement will influence perceptions of its implications when the statement is made in a social context. The comprehension of both single statements and multiple pieces of information in combination is considered. The way in which new information is interpreted can have considerable influence on how well it is remembered (Bransford, Barclay, & Franks, 1972; Bransford & Johnson, 1972; Hamilton, Katz, & Leirer, 1980). Moreover, when a piece of information (e.g., ""John gave someone an answer during an exam"") can be understood in terms of more than one concept (e.g., dishonest or helpful), the particular concept that is applied not only influences judgments and behavior toward its referents, but the magnitude of this influence increases over time (Carlston, 1980; Higgins, Rholes, & Jones, 1977; Srull & Wyer, 1980, 1983). Numerous theories of social cognition attempt to account for these effects and when they will occur (Bargh, 1997; Higgins, Bargh, & Lombardi, 1985; Martin, 1986; E. R. Smith, 1990; Wyer & Srull, 1986, 1989). Wyer and Srull's theory (1986, 1989) goes on to specify how the comprehension of information at early stages affects processing at later, goal-directed stages. These latter stages include the organization of different pieces of information into a single representation of their referent, the computation of a subjective judgment, and the transformation of this judgment into a response. The theory explicates the memory storage and retrieval processes that occur at each stage of cognitive activity. The Wyer and Srull model is the most well-articulated theory of social cognition to date, and it generates unique predictions for a number of phenomena that have been identified in social cognition"

After controlling for word reading, vocabulary knowledge, IQ, rapid automatized naming and phonological awareness measured at the initial level, the structural equation modeling results indicated that children’s compounding awareness made a significant direct contribution to reading comprehension only from Grade 5 to 6. Children’s reading comprehension also made a unique contribution to compounding awareness from Grade 5 to 6. Thus a reciprocal relationship between compounding awareness and reading comprehension was found for Grade 5 to 6. Reading comprehension in Grades 3 predicted homophone awareness in Grades 4 was marginal significance, but initial homophone awareness did not predict later reading comprehension across grades. Furthermore, there no unique connection between homograph awareness and reading comprehension across grades. These findings suggest a dynamic relationship between different aspects of morphological awareness and reading comprehension in Chinese-speaking children across elementary school years."

Results showed that Chinese readers needed at least 4 characters to the right of fixation to maintain a normal reading behavior when visually similar masks were used and when characters were displayed in small fonts, indicating that the span is dynamically influenced by masking materials. In Experiments 2 and 3, we asked whether the perceptual span varies as a function of font size in spaced (German) and unspaced (Chinese) scripts. Results clearly suggest perceptual span depends on font size in Chinese, but we failed to find such evidence for German.

Effects were generally stronger among African American students than among White students, and particularly strong among African Americans who felt more mistrusting of school. Indeed, among this latter group of students, the 2-year decline in trust evident in the control condition was, in the wise feedback condition, halted.

One key example is sunk cost, a past investment that cannot be recovered, that influences ongoing decisions. A sunk cost bias occurs when previous choices affect present decisions. Sunk cost decision-making has been primarily studied in Western, individualistic cultures although some attention has been focused on comparing its prevalence in collectivist cultures such as Japan and China. We evaluated the influence of individualist and collectivist cultures, perceived control and the role of self. In Study 1 Americans and Indians were primed with cultural values and then presented with sunk cost decision scenarios. Results indicated Americans made more sunk cost decision errors than Indians and personal decisions were associated with more bias than decisions made on behalf of others. Cultural differences on sunk cost bias were consistent with self-justification theory. In Study 2 a new set of sunk cost scenarios varied environmental use and sustainability themes. Results indicated particular situations influenced error, although country of origin and perceived behavioral control were also effective at predicting sunk cost bias. keywords: decision-making, cognitive bias, sunk cost, self-view, India, United States, environment"

The children′s oral reading and text parsing performance was measured on text of varying difficulty. Poor readers were less fluent and expressive than average readers across all levels of text difficulty. Clear group differences on ratings of fluency and expressiveness remained even when the performance of poor readers on the easiest text (on which they also received word identification practice) was compared with that of average readers on the most difficult text. Parsing contributed to fluency in average but not poor readers. Naming speed for digits was the greatest unique contributor to ratings of fluency among the individual difference factors examined.

However, how the brain network supporting phonological processing evolves and how it supports the initial course of learning to read is largely unknown. Here, for the first time, we characterized the emergence of the phonological network in 28 children over three stages (prereading, beginning reading, and emergent reading) longitudinally. Across these three time points, decreases in neural activation in the left inferior parietal cortex (LIPC) were observed during an audiovisual phonological processing task, suggesting a specialization process in response to reading instruction/experience. Furthermore, using the LIPC as the seed, a functional network consisting of the left inferior frontal, left posterior occipitotemporal, and right angular gyri was identified. The connection strength in this network co-developed with the growth of phonological skills. Moreover, children with above-average gains in phonological processing showed a significant developmental increase in connection strength in this network longitudinally, while children with below-average gains in phonological processing exhibited the opposite trajectory. Finally, the connection strength between the LIPC and the left posterior occipitotemporal cortex at the prereading level significantly predicted reading performance at the emergent reading stage. Our findings highlight the importance of the early emerging phonological network for reading development, providing direct evidence for the Interactive Specialization Theory and neurodevelopmental models of reading."

However, the converging predictions of these theories had previously not been tested directly. Two studies provided evidence that changes in situational features such as characters, their locations, their interactions with objects, and their goals are related to the segmentation of events in both narrative texts and films. A 3rd study indicated that clauses with event boundaries are read more slowly than are other clauses and that changes in situational features partially mediate this relation. A final study suggested that the predictability of incoming information influences reading rate and possibly event segmentation. Taken together, these results suggest that processing situational changes during comprehension is an important determinant of how one segments ongoing activity into events and that this segmentation is related to the control of processing during reading."

To test the fit of the proposed mediation model, longitudinal data from 308 ELLs from different linguistic backgrounds were analyzed using structural equation modeling. We examined the mediating role of Grade 2 word-level reading skills in the association between Grade 1 phonological awareness, naming speed, and listening comprehension and Grade 3 reading comprehension and reading fluency. The results indicated that word-level reading skills fully mediated the association between phonological awareness, reading comprehension and reading fluency. Word-level reading skills partially mediated the association between naming speed and reading fluency. Listening comprehension contributed directly to reading comprehension and reading fluency.

The current study sought to test this hypothesis in a large, prospective, communitybased study of initially nondemented Hispanic immigrants living in a Spanish-speaking enclave of northern Manhattan. Method: Participants included 1,067 participants in the Washington/Hamilton Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) who were tested in Spanish and followed at 18–24 month intervals for up to 23 years. Spanish-English bilingualism was estimated via both self-report and an objective measure of English reading level. Multilevel models for change estimated the independent effects of bilingualism on cognitive decline in 4 domains: episodic memory, language, executive function, and speed. Over the course of the study, 282 participants developed dementia. Cox regression was used to estimate the independent effect of bilingualism on dementia conversion. Covariates included country of origin, gender, education, time spent in the United States, recruitment cohort, and age at enrollment. Results: Independent of the covariates, bilingualism was associated with better memory and executive function at baseline. However, bilingualism was not independently associated with rates of cognitive decline or dementia conversion. Results were similar whether bilingualism was measured via self-report or an objective test of reading level. Conclusions: This study does not support a protective effect of bilingualism on age-related cognitive decline or the development of dementia. In this sample of Hispanic immigrants, bilingualism is related to higher initial scores on cognitive tests and higher educational attainment and may not represent a unique source of cognitive reserve."

We apply these criteria to assess the autonomy of the processes underlying simple mental arithmetic—the addition and multiplication of single digits—and find evidence that simple arithmetic may be only partially autonomous: It can begin without intention, but does not begin in the same way without intention as with intention and does not run on to completion without intention.

One way of circumventing these negative effects is to provide support in an ‘invisible’ or indirect manner, such that recipients do not construe the behavior as a supportive act. However, little is known about how recipients’ motivational states influence when visible (direct) support or invisible support is more beneficial. Using the framework of Regulatory Mode Theory, we predicted that recipients motivated to engage in critical evaluation (i.e., those with a predominant assessment motivation) would find invisible support more beneficial than visible support, whereas recipients motivated to initiate action (i.e., those with a predominant locomotion motivation) would find visible support more beneficial than invisible support. Findings from one 2 × 2 experiment (Study 1), two laboratory experiments (Studies 2–3), one dyadic study involving support conversations between friends (Study 4), and a meta-analysis aggregating data from all four studies supported these hypotheses. As predicted, support outcomes were better for assessment predominant recipients following invisible support, but were better for locomotion predominant recipients following visible support. Results indicate that support attempts could be made more effective by considering both support visibility and recipient motivation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"

We investigated the contribution of phonological processing deficits and uncertainty to the word recognition difficulties of dyslexic children by mathematical diffusion modeling of visual and auditory lexical decision data. The first study showed that poor visual lexical decision performance of reading disabled children was mainly due to a delay in the evaluation of word characteristics, suggesting impaired phonological processing. The adoption of elevated certainty criteria by the disabled readers suggests that uncertainty contributed to the visual word recognition impairments as well. The second study replicated the outcomes for visual lexical decision with formally diagnosed dyslexic children. In addition, during auditory lexical decision, dyslexics presented with reduced accuracy, which also resulted from delayed evaluation of word characteristics. Since orthographic influences are diminished during auditory lexical decision, this strengthens the phonological processing deficit account. Dyslexic children did not adopt heightened certainty criteria during auditory lexical decision, indicating that uncertainty solely impairs reading and not listening."

Results showed that the skills that underlie foreign language word reading are not universal, but are different for alphabetic and nonalphabetic orthographies, and are also different for transparent and nontransparent alphabetic orthographies, albeit to a lesser extent. Word reading acquisition in transparent alphabetic Spanish depended mainly on reading skills in the native language.

START,START,1986758163,reinforcers following greater effort are preferred a within trial contrast effect,2007,thomas r zentall,the behavior analyst today,1,4,20,"Psychologists who study human behavior often posit underlying mechanisms that are difficult to measure directly. And because humans are known to be complex organisms with complex motivational systems, researchers studying human behavior may avoid asking if there are simpler accounts of the behavior being studied. One such example is the phenomenon known as transposition. This phenomenon is familiar to musicians who after playing a tune in one key can seamlessly transpose the tune to a different key with no apparent change in the melody (the relations among the notes). A similar effect can be shown in rats, when after training them on a simultaneous light-gray (S+) versus dark-gray (S-) discrimination with responding to the light-gray reinforced, rats are tested with the light-gray stimulus and a still lighter-gray stimulus (Sn). In spite of the fact that responding to the S+ had a history of reinforcement and responding to the Sn had not, rats typically choose the Sn over the S+. That is, it appears that they learned to choose the lighter one during training and they continued to choose the lighter one on test trials. That is, it appears that they had learned the relation between the two training stimuli rather than their absolute properties. But Spence (1937) proposed that when organisms learn to respond to a stimulus for reinforcement, the tendency to respond generalizes to other similar stimuli (defining a gradient of stimulus generalization). Similarly, responding to the S- results in a gradient of inhibition around the value of the S- stimulus. According to Spence, it is the algebraic summation of those gradients at each point along the dimension that determines the strength of responding (the net response strength) at other points on the dimension (brightness in the example described). If one assumes that the gradients are convex (i.e., flatter near the training values) then the net gradient typically has its peak value not at the S+ but at a point away from the S+ in the direction away from the S-. This occurs because, given the presumed shape of the gradients, there would be a smaller decline in response strength as one begins to move away from the S+ than there would be a decline in inhibition at that point in the inhibitory gradient (see Spence, 1937). In this way, paradoxically, Spence's theory of learning about the absolute properties of a stimulus can account for an animal's choice of a novel stimulus, never seen before, over the S+ training value, and hence it can account for transposition without appealing to relational learning. Cognitive Dissonance An even more striking example of a presumably complex human behavior that is likely to be influenced by simpler behavioral processes is the supposed human motivation to reduce cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance occurs when there is a discrepancy between one's beliefs and one's behavior. This can occur when one acts in a way that is inconsistent with the way one believes one should act. According to cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), one should work to reduce the dissonance and if it is too late to avoid the behavior, one would modify one's beliefs to account for or justify one's behavior. Festinger and Carlsmith (1957) tested this theory by giving subjects a task considered to be boring and then asking them to tell a prospective subject that the task was interesting. In payment for this service, the experimenter would compensate them with a payment (the experimental manipulation) of either $1 or $20. But before carried out their assignment they were asked to fill out a questionnaire that included judgments about the task. Surprisingly, those subjects who were paid $1 judged the task to be more interesting than those who were paid $20. Festinger and Carlsmith explained the difference in terms of an attempt to reduce cognitive dissonance for the subjects paid only $1. For those subjects, the dissonance produced by having engaged in a boring task but having agreed to tell a potential subject that the task was interesting could not be resolved by appealing to the payment of $1. …"

Despite an effective manipulation of foveal processing load, we obtained no evidence of any modulatory influence on parafoveal processing in first-pass reading times. However, our results clearly showed that saccadic targeting, in relation to forward saccade length from the pretarget word and in relation to target word skipping, was influenced by foveal load and this influence occurred independent of parafoveal preview.

Compound words (Experiment 1) and single-character words (Experiments 2 and 3) were preceded by semantic and phonological primes. Strong semantic priming effects were found at both short (57 ms) and long (200 ms) stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), but phonological effects were either absent in lexical decision (Experiment 1), were present only at the longer SOA in character decision (Experiment 2) or were equally strong as semantic effects in naming (Experiment 3). Experiment 4 revealed facilitatory or inhibitory effects, depending on SOA, in phonological judgments to character pairs that were not phonologically but semantically related. It was concluded that, in reading Chinese, semantic information in the lexicon is activated at least as early and just as strongly as phonological information."

Languages vary in the consistency with which phonology is represented in orthography. This results in developmental differences in the grain size of lexical representations and accompanying differences in developmental reading strategies and the manifestation of dyslexia across orthographies. Differences in lexical representations and reading across languages leave developmental “footprints” in the adult lexicon. The lexical organization and processing strategies that are characteristic of skilled reading in different orthographies are affected by different developmental constraints in different writing systems. The authors develop a novel theoretical framework to explain these cross-language data, which they label a psycholinguistic grain size theory of reading and its development."

In Experiment 1, participants instructed to recall a time when their lives were unfair were more likely to refuse to help the experimenter with a supplementary task than were participants who recalled a time when they were bored. In Experiment 2, the same manipulation increased intentions to engage in a number of selfish behaviors, and this effect was mediated by self-reported entitlement to obtain positive (and avoid negative) outcomes. In Experiment 3, participants who lost at a computer game for an unfair reason (a glitch in the program) requested a more selfish money allocation for a future task than did participants who lost the game for a fair reason, and this effect was again mediated by entitlement."
START,START,2102994183,modeling individual differences in text reading fluency a different pattern of predictors for typically developing and dyslexic readers,2014,"pierluigi zoccolotti, maria de luca, chiara valeria marinelli, donatella spinelli",frontiers in psychology,1,12,96,"This study was aimed at predicting individual differences in text reading fluency. The basic proposal included two factors, i.e., the ability to decode letter strings (measured by discrete pseudo-word reading) and integration of the various sub-components involved in reading (measured by Rapid Automatized Naming, RAN). Subsequently, a third factor was added to the model, i.e., naming of discrete digits. In order to use homogeneous measures, all contributing variables considered the entire processing of the item, including pronunciation time. The model, which was based on commonality analysis, was applied to data from a group of 43 typically developing readers (11- to 13-year-olds) and a group of 25 chronologically matched dyslexic children. In typically developing readers, both orthographic decoding and integration of reading sub-components contributed significantly to the overall prediction of text reading fluency. The model prediction was higher (from ca. 37% to 52% of the explained variance) when we included the naming of discrete digits variable, which had a suppressive effect on pseudo-word reading. In the dyslexic readers, the variance explained by the two-factor model was high (69%) and did not change when the third factor was added. The lack of a suppression effect was likely due to the prominent individual differences in poor orthographic decoding of the dyslexic children. Analyses on data from both groups of children were replicated by using patches of colours as stimuli (both in the RAN task and in the discrete naming task) obtaining similar results. We conclude that it is possible to predict much of the variance in text-reading fluency using basic processes, such as orthographic decoding and integration of reading sub-components, even without taking into consideration higher-order linguistic factors such as lexical, semantic and contextual abilities. The approach validity of using proximal vs distal causes to predict reading fluency is discussed."

START,START,2594250733,we look like our names the manifestation of name stereotypes in facial appearance,2017,"yonat zwebner, annelaure sellier, nir rosenfeld, jacob goldenberg, ruth mayo",journal of personality and social psychology,1,9,78,"Research demonstrates that facial appearance affects social perceptions. The current research investigates the reverse possibility: Can social perceptions influence facial appearance? We examine a social tag that is associated with us early in life—our given name. The hypothesis is that name stereotypes can be manifested in facial appearance, producing a face-name matching effect, whereby both a social perceiver and a computer are able to accurately match a person’s name to his or her face. In 8 studies we demonstrate the existence of this effect, as participants examining an unfamiliar face accurately select the person’s true name from a list of several names, significantly above chance level. We replicate the effect in 2 countries and find that it extends beyond the limits of socioeconomic cues. We also find the effect using a computer-based paradigm and 94,000 faces. In our exploration of the underlying mechanism, we show that existing name stereotypes produce the effect, as its occurrence is culture-dependent. A self-fulfilling prophecy seems to be at work, as initial evidence shows that facial appearance regions that are controlled by the individual (e.g., hairstyle) are sufficient to produce the effect, and socially using one’s given name is necessary to generate the effect. Together, these studies suggest that facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a specific name should look. In this way a social tag may influence one’s facial appearance.

Based on a comprehensive developmental model, intervention included a universal-level classroom program plus social skills training, academic tutoring, parent training, and home visiting to improve competencies and reduce problems in a high-risk group of children selected in kindergarten. At the end of Grade 1, there were moderate positive effects on children's social, emotional, and academic skills; peer interactions and social status; and conduct problems and special-education use. Parents reported less physical discipline and greater parenting satisfaction/ease of parenting and engaged in more appropriate/consistent discipline, warmth/positive involvement, and involvement with the school. Evidence of differential intervention effects across child gender, race, site, and cohort was minimal. (Abstract Adapted from Source: Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 1999.
