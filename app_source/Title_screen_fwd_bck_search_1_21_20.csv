Unfortunately, while low sensitivity leads to under-identification of at-risk children, low specificity can lead to over-identification, resulting in inaccurate allocation of limited educational resources. The present study focused on children identified as at-risk in kindergarten who do not subsequently develop dyslexia to specify factors associated with better reading outcomes among at-risk children. Early screening was conducted in kindergarten and a subset of children was tracked longitudinally until second grade. Potential protective factors were evaluated at cognitive-linguistic, environmental, and neural levels. Relative to at-risk kindergarteners who subsequently developed dyslexia, those who did not were characterized by significantly higher socioeconomic status (SES), speech production accuracy, and microstructure of the posterior right-hemispheric superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). A positive association between microstructure of the right SLF and subsequent decoding skills was found to be specific to at-risk children and not observed among typical controls. Among at-risk children, several kindergarten-age factors were found to significantly contribute to the prediction of subsequent decoding skills: microstructure of the posterior right SLF, age, gender, SES, and phonological awareness. These findings suggest that putative compensatory mechanisms are already present by the start of kindergarten. The right SLF, in conjunction with the cognitive-linguistic and socioeconomic factors identified, may play an important role in facilitating reading development among at-risk children. This study has important implications for approaches to early screening, and assessment strategies for at-risk children."

Spelling productions were assessed both for phonological plausibility and for conventional accuracy. A path analysis revealed that phoneme segmentation and letter-sound knowledge were the precursor skills of early phonological spelling ability; in turn phonological spelling combined with reading to promote conventional spelling skill. Although initial phonological spelling ability predicted later reading, early reading ability did not influence later phonological spelling ability. These results indicate that skilled spelling requires a foundation in phonological transcoding ability which in turn enables the formation of orthographic representations. Our data also suggest that the increasingly complex and specific orthographic patterns demonstrated in children's spelling are learned through experience and instruction in both reading and spelling."

As the term is used by those who study early reading development, phonological processing refers to an individual's mental operations that make use of the phonological or sound structure of oral language when he or she is learning how to decode written language. The last 20 years of research have produced a broad variety of converging evidence that at least three kinds of phonological processing skills are positively related to individual differences in the rate at which beginning reading skills are acquired (see Adams, 1990; Brady & Shankweiler, 1991; Crowder & Wagner, 1991; and Torgesen, 1993, for recent reviews of this work).

The first goal was to compare the Ll and L2 language and literacy performances of the immersion students to a comparable group of children who attended the same school and were taking English as a core subject. The second purpose was to investigate which variables successfully predicted L2 English word identification and reading comprehension for the combined group of students. After pretest scores were controlled, it was found that the immersion students significantly performed at a higher level than the nonimmersion students on measures of oral language proficiency, vocabulary, phonological awareness, pseudoword decoding, reading identification, and reading comprehension, but there were no significant differences on measures of alphabet recognition, morphological awareness, or written grammar. There were particularly large differences for oral language proficiency and reading comprehension, favoring the immersion students. There were no differences between the groups on Chinese literacy measures, indicating that the program was an additive bilingual system and did not subtract from Ll literacy. The results from the regression analyses showed that literacy precursor variables that help to decode English words such as phonological awareness and pseudoword decoding ability were the best predictors of both word identification and reading comprehension in the early grades. Oral language proficiency and vocabulary became increasingly important in the upper grades, particularly in relation to reading comprehension. The results of the study suggest that instructional methods that emphasize the teaching of sound-symbol correspondences and phonological awareness may be helpful for the students and should be the focus of future experimental research. These study results have the potential to contribute to the debate about the feasibility and effectiveness of early English education in China and the ways that immersion programs change and adapt to meet local educational constraints and needs."

Children with dyslexia experience severe reading and/or spelling problems, which have an influence on their school and career development and their daily life. On the other hand, until now specific language impairment (SLI) is less known by teachers and parents. However, the prevalence of SLI is similar to dyslexia (around 7%). Children with SLI have persistent oral language problems that may be present in different language domains, such as deficits with semantics, morphosyntax, phonology and pragmatics. These children are at high risk to develop dyslexia later on. The overlap between both disorders seems higher than expected, but the amount of the overlap and the causes remain unclear. In daily practice, speech-language therapists have the experience that a number of children with SLI develop dyslexia, but surprisingly also a number of children with SLI do not have problems with word reading and spelling skills. In typically developing children, a number of good predictors for dyslexia have been demonstrated. However, it is unknown whether the same predictors are apparent in children with SLI. It is hard to predict which individual child with SLI is at high risk of developing literacy problems. The purpose of the present dissertation was to analyze the development of different skills important for literacy development in order to find good predictors for literacy delay in children with SLI. Therefore, a longitudinal study was performed in which children with SLI and children of a control group were followed from the last year of kindergarten until the start of grade 3. A whole range of tests was administered yearly measuring phonological, other oral language and literacy skills. Moreover, temporal auditory processing and speech perception were measured once in grade 1. For all these skills, a group of children with SLI and literacy delay was compared to a group of children with SLI and normal literacy and to a control group. These group comparisons revealed that both SLI groups had lower scores compared to the control group for phonological awareness and verbal short-term memory: in the SLI group with literacy delay these lower scores remained until grade 3, while in the SLI group with normal literacy the scores were only persistently lower for more demanding phonological awareness and verbal short-term memory tasks.

The results of a longitudinal study of first grade readers support this claim. Children were tested at four points throughout the year on tasks of syn thesis (phoneme blending) and analysis (deletion and tapping). Analyses of the tasks emphasize the differing cognitive demands of phoneme synthesis and pho neme deletion. According to the results of partial time-lag correlations, the dele tion task in particular taps a phonemic knowledge that is truly reciprocal in its re lation to reading.

An unbiased appraisal of these outcomes, however, requires carefully designed, longitudinal research. Method: A group of children first identified as having speech and/or language impairment in a community-based, longitudinal study at 5 years of age and matched controls were re-examined during young adulthood (age 19). A comprehensive battery of speech and language, cognitive and achievement tests, psychiatric interviews, and questionnaires were completed by subjects, their parents and teachers. Results: While children with early speech problems showed only a few academic differences from controls in young adulthood, early language impaired (LI) young adults lagged significantly behind controls in all areas of academic achievement, even after controlling for intelligence. Further, rates of learning disabilities (LD) were significantly higher in the LI group than both the controls and community base rates. Concurrent individual difference variables, including phonological awareness, naming speed for digits, non-verbal IQ, verbal working memory, and executive function, all contributed unique variance to achievement in specific areas. Conclusion: Early LI rather than speech impairment is clearly associated with continued academic difficulties into adulthood.

Longitudinal language-test data on 87 language-impaired children assessed at the ages of four, 4half;and 5 ¬Ωyears were converted to age-equivalent scores to compare the rates of development of children who recover from early language delay with those who have more persisting problems. On most measures, over the 18-month period all the children progressed by about 18 months. Thus although children with good and poor outcomes were distinguished in terms of initial level of performance, they did not differ in rate of progress. Speed on a peg-moving task was closely related to language performance. Children who had a good outcome after early language delay had significantly impaired scores at four years, but subsequently were indistinguishable from a control group. Quantitative but not qualitative differences in peg-moving performance were found for children with good and poor outcomes. No association was found between presumptive aetiological factors and language or pegboard performance. These findings are interpreted in terms of a theory which attributes specific language impairment to a maturational lag in neurological development.

Alteracion especifica del lenguaje como fallo madurativo: evidencia a partir de datos longitudinales sobre el lenguaje y el desarrollo motor



Los datos de un test longitudinal del lenguaje realizado en 87 niflos con alteracion del lenguaje, evaluados a la edad de cuatro, cuatro y medio y cinco anos y medio fueron convertidos en puntajes equivalentes de edad para comparar los porcentajes de desarrollo de niflos en fase de recuperacion de un retraso precoz del lenguaje, con los de aquellos que tienen problemas persistentes. En la mayoria de las mediciones, mas alia de los 18 meses todos los ninos progresaban alrededor de 18 meses. Asi a pesar de que los niflos con un curso rico o pobre se distinguian en terminos de niveies iniciales de realizacion, no difirieron en el porcentaje de progreso. La velocidad en una tarea movil estaba en intima relaci6n con la ejecucion del lenguaje. Los niflos que tenian un buen curso posterior despues de un retraso precoz del lenguaje, tenian unos puntajes significativamente afectados a los cuatro aflos, pero posteriormente no se distinguian del grupo control. Se hallaron diferencias cuantitativas pero no cualitativas en la ejecucion movil en ninos con curso posterior bueno o malo. Estos hallazgos se interpretan de acuerdo con una teoria que atribuye la alteracion especifica del lenguaje a un fallo madurativo en el desarrollo neurologico."

The model predicts an increase of individual differences in reading. Reciprocal relationships between reading and other factors seem to cause these increasing differences. This longitudinal study of 3 years was concerned with uncovering the existence and causes of increasing individual differences in reading in the early elementary grades. Data were analyzed within a structural equation modeling framework. The results clearly indicate increasing individual differences for word recognition skills. For reading comprehension, no such effects could be established for this limited time period. More important, some evidence for interactive relationships between reading and other cognitive skills, behaviors, and motivational factors, hypothesized to cause increasing differences between readers, was found. It is evident that not all children become proficient readers. How do individual differences in reading performance come into existence? For most children, reading development starts at school with formal education in Grade 1. However, the development of skills necessary to acquire reading skills starts well before the beginning of formal instruction in reading. Already before children enter school, large differences among them exist as a result of innate competencies and the quality and intensity of parental care invested in them (Walberg & Tsai, 1983). Taking initial differences between individuals as a starting point, the question is whether these differences remain stable or whether individuals converge or diverge in level of performance with further instruction in reading. Stability of individual differences, that is, a relative consistency of individual differences over age, has frequently been found in longitudinal studies of reading (Butler, Marsh, Sheppard, & Sheppard, 1985; Juel, 1994). However, this stability refers only to the rank ordering of participants within a certain population. The absolute performance difference between readers can increase or decline in the course of development as a result of interindividu al differences in intraindividu al change. Individual differences in reading ability do not seem to disappear with further development or to diminish over the years. Even among college students, large individual differences in their reading skills are still found (Perfetti, 1985). Thus, a decrease in variance with time is not to be expected. Instead of a decline,"

It was found that a child's ability to name letters in kindergarten was the strongest predictor of first-grade reading skill.

In this longitudinal study, we asked whether properties of white matter pathways at the onset of learning to read would be associated with reading abilities at older ages. Children (N = 37) with a wide range of reading abilities completed standardized measures of language and phonological awareness and diffusion MRI at age 6 years. Mean tract-fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted from reading-related pathways. At age 8, the same children were re-assessed using a standardized reading measure. Using linear regressions, we examined the contribution of tract-FA at age 6 to reading outcome at age 8, beyond known demographic and pre-literacy predictors of reading. Tract-FA of the left arcuate, left and right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and left inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP) made unique contributions to reading outcome after consideration of sex and family history of reading delays. Tract-FA of the left and right SLF and left ICP made unique contributions to reading outcome after the addition of pre-literacy skills. Thus, cerebellar and bilateral cortical pathways represented a network associated with subsequent reading abilities. Early white matter properties may be associated with other neuropsychological functions that predict reading or may influence reading development, independent of reading-related abilities.

We specifically looked at how different grain sizes in two brain regions implicated in phonological processing played a role in this bidirectional relation. According to the dual-stream model of speech processing and previous empirical studies, the posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) appears to be a perceptual region associated with phonological representations, whereas the dorsal inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) appears to be an articulatory region that accesses phonological representations in STG during more difficult tasks. 36 children completed a reading test outside the scanner and an auditory phonological task which included both small (i.e. onset) and large (i.e. rhyme) grain size conditions inside the scanner when they were 5.5‚Äì6.5 years old (Time 1) and once again approximately 1.5 years later (Time 2). To study the scaffolding hypothesis, a regression analysis was carried out by entering brain activation in either STG or IFG for either small (onset‚ÄØ>‚ÄØperceptual) or large (rhyme‚ÄØ>‚ÄØperceptual) grain size phonological processing at T1 as the predictors and reading skill at T2 as the dependent measure, with several covariates of no interest included. To study the refinement hypothesis, the regression analysis included reading skill at T1 as the predictor and brain activation in either STG or IFG for either small or large grain size phonological processing at T2 as the dependent measures, with several covariates of no interest included. We found that only posterior STG, regardless of grain size, was predictive of reading gains. Parallel models with only behavioral accuracy were not significant. Taken together, our results suggest that the representational quality of phonology in temporal cortex is crucial for reading development. Moreover, our study provides neural evidence supporting the scaffolding hypothesis, suggesting that brain measures of phonology could be helpful in early identification of reading difficulties."

The present study aimed to describe the academic achievement of children speaking Spanish and Catalan with developmental language disorder (DLD) during their primary education and to predict their academic outcomes using several processing skills assessed at the beginning of their schooling. To this end, we followed 28 children during their schooling (6‚Äì12 years of age). Participants were divided into two groups, one with DLD (n = 14) and a control group (n = 14) paired by age, gender, socio-economic status (SES), family language (L1), and classroom. All participants were assessed through different processing skills with the Spanish version of the NEPSY at the beginning of their schooling (age 6): attention (visual attention, auditory attention, and response set), phonological awareness, verbal short-term memory (sentence repetition, and narrative memory), access to language (semantic verbal fluency and rapid naming), and language comprehension (comprehension of verbal commands). At the end of primary education, schools reported the official academic marks at the 1st cycle (6‚Äì8 years), 2nd cycle (8‚Äì10 years) and 3rd cycle (10‚Äì12 years). Direct scores of the processing skills and academic results were used for statistical analyses. Results showed that children with DLD had more frequent grade retention, and their academic marks were significantly lower than those of their peers in all the cycles and for all academic subjects with a high language dependency (all except physical education and mathematics). Those subjects with lower language dependence did not show significant differences (physical education and mathematics). Rapid naming accounted for most of the variance of academic outcomes, followed by phonological awareness, and language comprehension when both groups were taken together. Only rapid naming accounted for academic results in the DLD group and phonological awareness did so for the control group. In sum, children with DLD experienced more academic difficulties during their primary education. Those children (with and without DLD) who experienced difficulties not only with rapid naming but also with phonological awareness and oral language comprehension at the beginning of their schooling showed a higher probability of academic failure."

Children from families of lower socioeconomic status (SES) tend to have poorer reading performance and this gap widens across years of schooling. Reading relies on the orchestration of multiple neural systems integrated via specific white-matter pathways, but there is limited understanding about whether these pathways relate differentially to reading performance depending on SES background. Kindergarten white-matter FA and second-grade reading outcomes were investigated in an SES-diverse sample of 125 children. The three left-hemisphere white-matter tracts most associated with reading, and their right-hemisphere homologs, were examined: arcuate fasciculus (AF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). There was a significant and positive association between SES and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the bilateral ILF in kindergarten. SES moderated the association between kindergarten ILF and second grade reading performance, such that it was positive in lower-SES children, but not significant in higher-SES children. These results have implications for understanding the role of the environment in the development of the neural pathways that support reading."

At that time, although matched for nonverbal IQ (mean 92‚Äì93) and expressive language, the Language group showed significantly fewer social and behavioural problems. At follow-up, when aged on average, 23 to 24 years, the Autism group continued to show significantly more impairments in terms of stereotyped behaviour patterns, social relationships, jobs, and independence. However, problems in all these areas were also common in the Language group. Many still lived with their parents, few had close friends or permanent jobs, and ratings of social interaction indicated abnormalities in a number of different areas. On a composite measure of social competence only 10% of the Language group was assessed as having severe social difficulties compared to 74% of the Autism group. Nevertheless, 65% were rated as having moderate social problems and only 25% were rated as being of near/normal social functioning. Two individuals in the Language group, but none in the Autism group, had also developed a florid paranoid psychosis in late adolescence.

As in the follow-up of cognitive and linguistic functioning (see Mawhood et al., 2000, this volume, pp. 547‚Äì559), discriminant function analysis, which had clearly distinguished between the groups as children, now showed much greater overlap between them. Regression analysis indicated that although early language ability appeared to be related to outcome in the Autism group, there was little association between any measures of childhood functioning and prognosis in the Language group. Theoretically, these findings have implications for our understanding of the nature of autism and other pervasive language disorders, and of the relationship between them. Practically, they demonstrate the very persistent problems experienced by individuals with developmental language disorders, and their need for much greater help and support than is presently available."

Analysis of these data revealed that the beneficial effects on reading performance of having taken part in the parent involvement exercise were still clearly apparent three years later.

Twelve individuals with Down syndrome, whose data were originally reported in NA Roch and Jarrold (2008) , were seen four years later, and were given the same tasks as in the previous study evaluating phonological awareness, non-word reading and irregular word reading. After four years, an improvement was observed in all the skills of interest. Furthermore, the pattern of relationships among the three skills was observed to change considerably across the four year period. At the first time point, a weak association between non-word and irregular word reading was found, but there was a strong association between these two measures at the second time point. In contrast, a strong relationship was found at Time 1 between non-word reading and phonological awareness, which became weaker at Time 2. Longitudinal associations between the three skills were also examined in order to explain this changing pattern of associations. The results indicated that the ability to decode non-words plays a marginal role on later irregular word reading. In contrast, irregular word reading is a longitudinal predictor of later non-word reading. Phonological awareness was not longitudinally related to non-word reading. The results indicate that developing word knowledge can facilitate later non-word reading in Down syndrome, perhaps by a process of reading by visual analogy to known lexical items. NA Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to (a) explain the development of word reading, non-word reading and phonological awareness in Down syndrome; (b) explain the longitudinal changes in the relationships among the three skills; (c) explain the relevance for education of the influence of word reading for the improvement in non-word reading."

The main goal of the first study was to examine whether reading level at age 8 can be predicted on the basis of a skill very rarely examined in longitudinal studies: phonemic discrimination. Two groups of French-speaking children were selected based on their phonemic discrimination skills at age 5: a group with low skills and a group with average to high skills in that domain. These two groups were respectively classified as being ""at-risk"" and ""not-at-risk"" for reading acquisition, and were matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ and vocabulary. Phonemic discrimination was found to be an important predictor of reading acquisition. Indeed, the two groups defined at age 5 based on their phonemic discrimination skills obtained significantly different reading scores at age 8, and the proportion of children with reading disabilities was higher in the at-risk group than in the not-at-risk group. The main goal of the second study was to assess whether reading skills at age 8 could be predicted by the ""classical"" predictors of reading acquisition assessed at age 5: pre-reading level, letter-name knowledge, phonemic segmentation and phonological short-term-memory (STM). A high proportion of the variance in reading at age 8 (52.8%) was predicted by these predictors, with four contributing unique and significant portions of that variance: pre-reading level, letter-name knowledge for vowels (not for consonants), phonemic segmentation (not syllabic segmentation) and phonological STM."

The children were followed from the beginning of kindergarten (at the age of 6, 1 year before reading instruction in Denmark) until the beginning of the second grade. Children of dyslexic parents were found to have an increased risk of dyslexia (a 4.3 odds ratio) when dyslexia was defined as poor phonological recoding (poor reading of nonwords and pseudohomophones of real words). All language measures in kindergarten were statistically significant predictors of dyslexia. Logistic regression analyses with backwards stepwise selection indicated that three measures contributed independently to the prediction of dyslexia: letter naming, phoneme identification, and distinctness of phonological representations. The measure of distinctness of phonological representations also contributed significantly to the prediction of poor phoneme awareness in Grade 2‚Äîeven when differences in early syllable and phoneme awareness, articulation, and productive and receptive vocabulary were accounted for. The results suggest that the quality of phonological representations in the mental lexicon is a determinant of the development of both segmental (e.g., phoneme) awareness and of the acquisition of phonological recoding skills in reading.

ESTE TRABAJO presenta los resultados de un estudio longitudinal de ninos hijos de padres dislexicos y normales. El seguimiento de los ninos se produjo desde el comienzo del preescolar (a la edad de seis anos, un ano antes de comenzar la ensenanza de la lectura en Dinamarca), hasta el comienzo de segundo grado. Se hallo que entre los hijos de padres dislexicos aumentaba el riesgo de dislexia (a razon del 4.3) cuando se definia la dislexia como problemas de recodificacion fonologica (problemas para leer pseudo-palabras y pseudo-homofonos de palabras reales). Todas las medidas de lenguaje tomadas en preescolar fueron predictoras de dislexia estadisticamente significativas. Los analisis de regresion logistica con seleccion por pasos indicaron que las tres medidas contribuian independientemente a la prediccion de la dislexia: nombrar letras, identificar fonemas y la precision de las representaciones fonologicas. La medida de precision de las representaciones fonologicas tambien contribuyo significativamente a predecir problemas de conciencia fonologica en segundo grado - aun cuando se tomaron en cuenta las diferencias en conciencia silabica y fonologica tempranas. Los resultados sugieren que la calidad de las representaciones fonologicas en el lexico mental es determinante tanto del desarrollo de la conciencia segmental (por ej., fonologica) como de la adquisicion de habilidades fonologicas en la lectura.

DIESER ARTIKEL stellt die Ergebnisse einer Langzeitstudie mit Kindern von dyslexischen und normal-lesenden Eltern vor. Die Kinder wurden mit Beginn des Kindergartens (im Alter von sechs, ein Jahr vor Beginn des Leseunterrichts in Danemark) bis zum Eintritt in das zweite Schuljahr betreut. Es wurde festgestellt, das Kinder von dyslexischen Eltern einem erhohten Risiko der Dyslexie unterliegen (im Wahrscheinlichkeitsverhaltnis von 4.3), wobei Dyslexie als unzureichende phonologische Wiedergabe definiert wurde (Leseschwache mit nicht-bestimmbaren Worten und scheinbaren Gleichlauten bzw. Pseudo-Homophonie bei realen Worten). Alle im Kindergarten ermittelten sprachlichen Masnahmen erwiesen sich als statistisch bedeutende Hinweise auf Dyslexie. Logistische Regressionsanalysen mit schrittweisen, ruckwirkenden Betrachtungsablaufen indizierten drei wesentliche Masnahmen, die unabhangig voneinander zur Bestimmung von Dyslexie beitragen: Buchstabieren, phonemische Unterscheidung und Deutlichkeit der phonologischen Ausdrucksweisen. Die systematische Bemessung der Deutlichkeit der phonologischen Reprasentation trug ebenfalls wesentlich zur Bestimmung eines voraussichtlich auftretenden geschwachten phonemischen Bewustseins bei Schulern in der zweiten Klasse bei, sogar wenn Unterschiede in der fruhen Erkenntnis von Silbenbildung und phonemischer Wahrnehmung, Artikulation bzw. Wortgliederung, sowie in produktiver und rezeptiver Wortbildung ermittelt wurden. Die Ergebnisse weisen daraufhin, das die Qualitat der phonologischen Vorstellungen im mentalen Lexikon ein Bestimmungsfaktor in der Entwicklung beider segmentaler (z.B. phonemischer) Aufnahmefahigkeiten und der Aneignung von phonologischen Wiedergabefahigkeiten beim Lesen ist.

Les enfants ont ete suivis du debut du jardin d'enfants (a six ans, un an avant l'enseignement de la lecture au Danemark) jusqu'au commencement de la seconde annee. On a trouve que les enfants de parents dyslexiques presentent un plus grand risque de dyslexie (4.3 fois plus) quand la dyslexie est definie comme un faible recodage phonologique (faible lecture de non-mots et de pseudo-homophones de mots reels). Tous les indicateurs langagiers au jardin d'enfants sont des predicteurs statistiquement significatifs de dyslexie. Des analyses de regression avec selection retroactive variable par variable ont montre que trois mesures contribuent independam ment a predire la dyslexie: la denomination de lettres, l'identification de phonemes, et la precision dans les representations phonologiques. La mesure de la precision dans les representations phonologiques contribue aussi de maniere significative a predire une faible conscience phonemique en deuxieme annee, meme si les differences initiales de conscience de la syllabe et du phoneme, de l'articulation, et du vocabulaire emis ou produit sont prises en consideration. Les resultats suggerent que la qualite des representations phonologiques dans le lexique interne est un determinant du developpement tant de la conscience segmentale (par exemple du phoneme) que de l'acquisition des habiletes de recodage phonologique en lecture."

The children's scores on phonological awareness tasks as 4 year olds significantly predicted their reading and spelling ages 6 years later. Qualitative analyses of their reading and spelling processes, conducted within the framework of dual-route models of reading and spelling, indicated that children with good early phonological awareness have well-developed lexical and sublexical reading and spelling procedures. However, they show larger regularity effects in word reading and spelling, are better at nonword reading and spelling, and make more phonologically based errors in both reading and spelling than children with poor early phonological awareness. Furthermore, early phonological awareness scores are significantly related to reading regular but not irregular words. The results are interpreted to suggest that early phonological skills relate more strongly to development of sublexical than lexical processing systems."

Also considered is the double-deficit hypothesis, by which students with both slow naming speed and low phonological awareness are hypothesized to be most at-risk for reading disability. Finally, the instructional literature regarding attempts to improve naming speed and use of naming speed as a predictor of response to intervention is reviewed. The authors conclude that naming speed is uniquely associated with a range of reading tasks across orthographies, and that early identification would be improved by the inclusion of naming speed measures. The poor response to instruction of students who have slow naming speed should be considered when designing interventions. Further work is required to specify the theoretical nature of naming speed and to determine how to help students with slow naming speed.

On analyse dans cet article les interpretations theoriques courantes de la vitesse de denomination et la litterature de recherche concernant ses relations avec la lecture. Les auteurs analysent les effets de la vitesse de lecture a travers les langues et la forme de sa relation a la lecture. On analyse egalement l'hypothese du double deficit selon laquelle les eleves ayant a la fois une vitesse de denomination lente et une conscience phonologique faible sont consideres comme presentant le plus de risques de difficultes en lecture. On analyse enfin la litterature pedagogique sur les essais d'amelioration de la vitesse de lecture et d'utilisation de la vitesse de denomination comme predicteur de la reponse a l'intervention. Les auteurs concluent que la vitesse de denomination est associee uniquement a un ensemble de t√¢ches de lecture liees a l'orthographe, et que l'identification precoce pourrait etre amelioree si elle incluait des evaluations de la vitesse de lecture. Les reponses mediocres des eleves qui ont une vitesse de denomination lente devraient etre prises en consideration lors de la planification des interventions. D'autres travaux sont necessaires pour preciser la nature de la vitesse de denomination sur le plan theorique et pour determiner comment proceder pour aider les eleves qui ont une faible vitesse de denomination.

En este articulo se examinan las interpretaciones teoricas mas recientes de la rapidez de nombrar y la literatura sobre la investigacion en cuanto a su relacion con la lectura. Los autores examinan el efecto de la rapidez de nombrar a traves de los idiomas y la forma en que se relaciona a la lectura. Tambien se examina la hipotesis de la doble deficiencia, la cual considera que los estudiantes lentos al nombrar y de poca conciencia fonologica estan a alto riesgo de tener dificultades con la lectura. Por ultimo, se revisa la literatura instruccional sobre los intentos de mejorar no solo la rapidez de nombrar sino tambien su uso como predictor de dificultades al leer. Los autores llegan a la conclusion que la rapidez de nombrar tiene una relacion especial con una serie de tareas de lectura a traves de las ortografias, y que se mejoraria la identificacion temprana si se incluyeran medidas de la rapidez de nombrar. La poca respuesta a la instruccion de estudiantes de baja rapidez de nombrar se debe tomar en cuenta al disenar intervenciones. Se necesitan mas estudios para especificar la base teorica de la rapidez de nombrar y para determinar como ayudar a los estudiantes con una baja rapidez de nombrar."

However, the degree to which dorsal stream deficits play a causal role in reading failure has not been established. This study used coherent motion and visual frequency doubling to examine whether dorsal stream sensitivity measured before the commencement of formal reading instruction can predict emerging literacy skills in Grade 1. We demonstrate that over age, IQ and Kindergarten Letter knowledge, pre-reading measures of dorsal stream functioning, as assessed by frequency doubling sensitivity, could predict early literacy skills. These findings suggest that the relationship between dorsal stream functioning and poor reading skills exists before children learn to read, strengthening the claim that dorsal stream deficits may play a contributing role in reading failure."

In this study we evaluated whether the sophistication of children's invented spellings in kindergarten was predictive of subsequent reading and spelling in Grade 1, while also considering the influence of well-known precursors. Children in their first year of schooling (mean age = 66 months; N = 171) were assessed on measures of oral vocabulary, alphabetic knowledge, phonological awareness, word reading and invented spelling; approximately 1 year later they were assessed on multiple measures of reading and spelling. Path modeling was pursued to evaluate a hypothesized unique, causal role of invented spelling in subsequent literacy outcomes. Results supported a model in which invented spelling contributed directly to concurrent reading along with alphabetic knowledge and phonological awareness. Longitudinally, invented spelling influenced subsequent reading, along with alphabetic knowledge while mediating the connection between phonological awareness and early reading. Invented spelling also influenced subsequent conventional spelling along with phonological awareness, while mediating the influence of alphabetic knowledge. Invented spelling thus adds explanatory variance to literacy outcomes not entirely captured by well-studied code and language-related skills."

Language abilities, tested with an extensive test battery at the onset of formal reading instruction, were represented by four statistically uncorrelated factors: NA lexical-semantic abilities , NA auditory perception , NA verbal-sequential processing , and NA speech production . All factors contributed significantly to the prediction of word reading and spelling development seven months later.

Furthermore, autoregression effects of word decoding and spelling were strong and NA verbal-sequential processing NA had predictive value on word spelling nineteen months later when pre-existing spelling abilities were accounted for. Children with SLI and normal literacy skills performed better on most of the language and language-related measures than children with SLI and poor literacy skills.

However, longitudinal studies are rare and typically do not control for other predictors which contribute to development in these domains. This large-scale longitudinal study examined the extent to which pattern understanding is a unique predictor of reading and arithmetic, after controlling for a range of theoretically important skills. We assessed a large sample of 5-year old children (N‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ569) in the first few months of school on measures of reading, arithmetic, naming speed, number knowledge, counting, non-symbolic magnitude, executive function, oral language, and non-verbal IQ. Children completed alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric pattern understanding tasks six months later. Reading and arithmetic skills were assessed again 12 months after the initial assessment. Latent variable path models showed that pattern understanding predicted significant additional variance in both reading and arithmetic after controlling for a range of other variables. Pattern understanding was in turn predicted by executive function, which indirectly predicted both reading and arithmetic. Thus, we find support for a role of domain general skills (executive function and pattern understanding) as shared predictors of both reading and arithmetic."

Methods: For the purpose of this study, the criterion variable tests and predictor variable tests for spelling and composition were administered to elementary school students from first through fifth grade. Through extensive review of literature, the predictors for spelling included vocabulary, orthographic processing, morphological processing, letter sound knowledge, and word recognition. The predictors for composition included vocabulary, morphological processing, working memory, listening comprehension, reading comprehension, and spelling. Then, a stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to explore the predictive factors for spelling and composition outcomes of elementary school students.

Haarbauer-Krupa The purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine the relationship between language and reading in children diagnosed with developmental language disorder (DLD) during preschool. An archival data set was available for analysis. Preschool children with DLD who were assessed between 35 and 74 months for preschool language and speech abilities (Rapin, 1996) returned for language, speech and reading testing at age seven years. Children who enrolled in the study were a clinically referred sample, met criteria for average nonverbal intellectual functioning, and demonstrated below average performance on a composite language measure. To evaluate a hypothesis about the contribution of vocabulary, grammar, and speech articulation to reading outcome measures, a series of regression analyses tested models to identify predictors of reading achievement at age seven. Results indicated a strong, positive relationship between language skills assessed at both ages and reading comprehension. School-age language and speech skills explained 25% of the variance in reading comprehension after controlling for word identification skills. Grammar at school age was a significant unique predictor of reading comprehension. Preschool language and speech skills explained 22% of the variance after controlling for word identification skills. Speech articulation was not related to reading outcomes. In contrast, regression analyses suggested that language and speech skills did not predict word reading abilities. Children who had reading comprehension difficulties had weaker vocabulary, grammar and speech skills compared to children who had average and above comprehension skills. Findings support previous research describing a relationship between language skills and reading comprehension. Language skills measured at preschool can predict reading comprehension difficulties in elementary school for children with DLD. Results highlight the importance of early identification and intervention of language impairment in children to improve areas of vocabulary and grammar critical to reading success.

A sample of 78 second-year kindergartners was followed until the end of first grade. With respect to predictors, linguistic, phonological, and orthographic skills were considered, but also reading and spelling level at an earlier point in time. To account for all possible kind of processes, three linear and one nonlinear regression models were used to accomplish the analyses. The best predictor of level of and progress in letter reading, word reading, letter spelling, and word spelling in first grade is the same skill at an earlier point in time. Although the pattern of progress in letter reading between kindergarten and first grade, letter spelling, and word spelling appears to be continuous, the pattern of progress in letter reading and word reading between the middle and the end of first grade is discontinuous. The results also indicate a Matthew effect for word reading only. Reading and spelling are fundamental and important skills in society and education. Education is based on the ability to read and spell, so failure in these areas will have large consequences for learning. For decades, researchers have looked into predictors of reading and spelling, to make early identification of problems in these areas possible. The majority of prediction studies on reading and spelling followed children from kindergarten into first or second grade. The general pattern of this research resulted in a coherent set of predictors for reading, namely, letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and rapid naming. This is shown in Table 1. It presents an overview of studies that have investigated the main predictors of early reading in normally developing children. Although research on predicting spelling ability is much rarer (Naucler, 2004), the general pattern of predictors of early spelling is similar to that of reading. Table 2 presents an overview of studies that have investigated the main predictors of early spelling in normally developing children, and the main predictors are again letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and working memory. The fact that letter knowledge is one of the best predictors of reading and spelling performance is not surprising. After all, reading and spelling in an alphabetical language requires the knowledge of all graphemes (i.e., letters or letter clusters) that represent the phonemes of the language. Less obvious is the role of phonological awareness for the prediction of literacy skills. Phonological awareness refers to the ability to recognize, discriminate, and manipulate the sounds of the language (e.g., Anthony & Francis, 2005). Phonological awareness is a broadly defined concept and the reviewed studies reveal that a large number of different tasks has been used to measure phonological Predicting Progress in Early Literacy Skills awareness. Adams (1990) identified five levels of phonemic awareness in which tasks can be classified. At the most basic level, the child only has to have ear for the sounds of words. This level includes performing rhyming tasks. For example, the child might be asked to tell which of the three words does not rhyme: ‚Äòhat‚Äô, ‚Äòcat‚Äô, ‚Äòdog‚Äô. At the second level, the child has to be able to compare and contrast the sounds of words in rhyming and alliteration tasks. For example, the child might be asked to tell which of three words begins with a different sound: ‚Äòdog‚Äô, ‚Äòsun‚Äô, and ‚Äòdoll‚Äô. At the third level, the child is familiar with the notion that words can be divided into phonemes, and knows how the phonemes sound in isolation. Examples of tasks are blending phonemes or syllable-splitting. For phoneme blending, the child has to listen to the sounds and put them together to form a word. For example, the instructor might say ‚Äò/c/-/a/-/t/‚Äô and the child has to say ‚Äòcat‚Äô. At the fourth level, the child has to be able to segment phonemes. For this task, the child has to say which sounds it hears in a particular word. For example, the instructor might say ‚Äòdog‚Äô, and the child has to respond with ‚Äò/d/-/o/-/g/‚Äô. At the final level, the child has to be able to manipulate phonemes, like adding, deleting or moving phonemes. For instance, a child might be asked to say ‚Äòmonkey‚Äô without the ‚Äò/k/‚Äô. Skills at the phoneme level (third, fourth, and fifth level) are better predictors of reading than onset-rhyming skills (first and second level; e.g., Hulme et al., 2002). Rapid naming is also a less obvious predictor and refers to the ability to retrieve phonological codes stored in long-term memory (Allor, 2002). The rapid-naming ability is measured by the amount of time a child needs to name stimuli, like digits, letters, colors or pictures. Rapid naming is associated with reading, since both skills require the child to learn arbitrary associations between symbols and sounds (Manis, Seidenberg, & Doi, 1999). Some other required abilities are also similar for rapid naming and reading, like visual-motor coordination, serial scanning of text, accessing word names and meanings rapidly from memory, and articulation. Working memory appears to be one of the best predictors for spelling, and to a lower extent for reading. However, recent studies have shown that this aspect of cognition appears to add to the understanding of both reading and spelling skills. Working memory is considered to span both the storage and processing of information. To be able to read, one has to keep track of the coupling of letters to phonemes in the right order, that is, from left to right with respect to its graphemes and from first to last with respect to its phonemes. If this process does not proceed properly, reading and spelling may be hampered. An important conclusion from the above is that the main predictors of early reading and spelling in normally developing children are all language-related skills: letter knowledge, phonological awareness, rapid naming, and working memory. Children who have deficits in this area are children with language and communication problems. These children are at risk for developing reading and spelling problems. In the Netherlands, these children are either attending a special-education school for language and"

What other neurocognitive systems differ across individuals as a function of SES? Does linguistic ability mediate SES differences in other systems? And how do specific prefrontal/executive subsystems vary with SES? One hundred and fifty healthy, socioeconomically diverse first-graders were administered tasks tapping language, visuospatial skills, memory, working memory, cognitive control, and reward processing.

It is well established that a major cause of these problems lies in poorly specified phonological representations. Many individuals with dyslexia also present impairments in auditory temporal processing and speech perception, but it remains debated whether these more basic perceptual impairments play a role in causing the reading problem. Longitudinal studies may help clarifying this issue by assessing preschool children before they receive reading instruction and by following them up through literacy development. The current longitudinal study shows impairments in auditory frequency modulation (FM) detection, speech perception and phonological awareness in kindergarten and in grade 1 in children who receive a dyslexia diagnosis in grade 3. FM sensitivity and speech-in-noise perception in kindergarten uniquely contribute to growth in reading ability, even after controlling for letter knowledge and phonological awareness. These findings indicate that impairments in auditory processing and speech perception are not merely an epiphenomenon of reading failure. Although no specific directional relations were observed between auditory processing, speech perception and phonological awareness, the highly significant concurrent and predictive correlations between all these variables suggest a reciprocal association and corroborate the evidence for the auditory deficit theory of dyslexia."

This hypothesis is mostly based on results showing a high degree of correlation between phonological awareness and metrical skills, using a very specific metrical task. We present new findings from the analysis of a sample of 48 children with a diagnosis of dyslexia, without comorbidities. These children were assessed with neuropsychological tests, as well as specifically-devised psychoacoustic and musical tasks mostly testing temporal abilities. Associations were tested by multivariate analyses including data mining strategies, correlations and most importantly logistic regressions to understand to what extent the different auditory and musical skills can be a robust predictor of reading and phonological skills.

The epidemiology of preschool speech sound disorder is poorly understood. Our aims were to determine: the prevalence of idiopathic speech sound disorder; the comorbidity of speech sound disorder with language and pre-literacy difficulties; and the factors contributing to speech outcome at 4¬†years.

Method
One thousand four hundred and ninety-four participants from an Australian longitudinal cohort completed speech, language, and pre-literacy assessments at 4¬†years. Prevalence of speech sound disorder (SSD) was defined by standard score performance of ‚â§79 on a speech assessment. Logistic regression examined predictors of SSD within four domains: child and family; parent-reported speech; cognitive-linguistic; and parent-reported motor skills.

Results
At 4¬†years the prevalence of speech disorder in an Australian cohort was 3.4%. Comorbidity with SSD was 40.8% for language disorder and 20.8% for poor pre-literacy skills. Sex, maternal vocabulary, socio-economic status, and family history of speech and language difficulties predicted SSD, as did 2-year speech, language, and motor skills. Together these variables provided good discrimination of SSD (area under the curve=0.78).

Interpretation
This is the first epidemiological study to demonstrate prevalence of SSD at 4¬†years of age that was consistent with previous clinical studies. Early detection of SSD at 4¬†years should focus on family variables and speech, language, and motor skills measured at 2¬†years."

This paper examines what the relationships are between FRD and these skills, and whether deficits in speech, language and phonological processing fully account for the increased risk of dyslexia in children with FRD. One hundred and fifty-three 4‚Äì6-year-old children, 44 of whom had FRD, completed a battery of speech, language, phonology and literacy tasks. Word reading and spelling were retested 6 months later, and text reading accuracy and reading comprehension were tested 3 years later. The children with FRD were at increased risk of developing difficulties in reading accuracy, but not reading comprehension. Four groups were compared: good and poor readers with and without FRD. In most cases good readers outperformed poor readers regardless of family history, but there was an effect of family history on naming and nonword repetition regardless of literacy outcome, suggesting a role for speech production skills as an endophenotype of dyslexia. Phonological processing predicted spelling, while language predicted text reading accuracy and comprehension. FRD was a significant additional predictor of reading and spelling after controlling for speech production, language and phonological processing, suggesting that children with FRD show additional difficulties in literacy that cannot be fully explained in terms of their language and phonological skills."

In children, this left hemispheric cortical specialization for letter strings is typically detected only after approximately 1 y of formal schooling and reading acquisition. Here, we recorded scalp electrophysiological (EEG) brain responses in 5-y-old (n = 40) prereaders presented with letter strings appearing every five items in rapid streams of pseudofonts (6 items per second). Within 2 min of recording only, letter strings evoked a robust specific response over the left occipito-temporal cortex at the predefined frequency of 1.2 Hz (i.e., 6 Hz/5). Interindividual differences in the amplitude of this electrophysiological response are significantly related to letter knowledge, a preschool predictor of later reading ability. These results point to the high potential of this rapidly collected behavior-free measure to assess reading ability in developmental populations. These findings were replicated in a second experiment (n = 26 preschool children), where familiar symbols and line drawings of objects evoked right-lateralized and bilaterally specific responses, respectively, showing the specificity of the early left hemispheric dominance for letter strings. Collectively, these findings indicate that limited knowledge of print in young children, before formal education, is sufficient to develop specialized left lateralized neuronal circuits, thereby pointing to an early onset and rapid impact of left hemispheric reentrant sound mapping on posterior cortical development."

We investigated the interrelationship of crossmodal integration, both in terms of behavioral performance and pSTS activity, with AF tract coherence using a rhyme judgment task in a group of 47 children with a range of reading abilities. We demonstrate that both response accuracy and pSTS activity for crossmodal auditory-visual rhyme judgments was predictive of fractional anisotropy along the left AF. Unimodal auditory-only or visual-only pSTS activity was not significantly related to AF connectivity. Furthermore, activity in other reading-related ROIs did not show the same AV-only AF coherence relationship, and AV pSTS activity was not related to connectivity along other language-related tracts. This study is the first to directly show that crossmodal brain activity is specifically related to connectivity in the AF, supporting its role in phoneme-grapheme integration ability.

Current norms suggest that complete mastery of the production of the consonant phonemes in English occurs in most children at around 6‚Äì7 years. Many children enter formal schooling (kindergarten) around 5 years of age with near-adult levels of speech production. Given that previous research has shown that speech production abilities and phonological awareness skills are linked in preschool children, we set out to examine whether this pattern also holds for children just beginning to learn to read, as suggested by the critical age hypothesis. In the present study, using a diverse sample, we explored whether expressive phonological skills in 92 5-year-old children at the beginning and end of kindergarten were associated with early reading skills. Speech errors were coded according to whether they were developmentally appropriate, position within the syllable, manner of production of the target sounds, and whether the error involved a substitution, omission, or addition of a speech sound. At the beginning of the school year, children with significant early reading deficits on a predictively normed test (DIBELS) made more speech errors than children who were at grade level. Most of these errors were typical of kindergarten children (e.g., substitutions involving fricatives), but reading-delayed children made more of these errors than children who entered kindergarten with grade level skills. The reading-delayed children also made more atypical errors, consistent with our previous findings about preschoolers. Children who made no speech errors at the beginning of kindergarten had superior early reading abilities, and improvements in speech errors over the course of the year were significantly correlated with year-end reading skills. The role of expressive vocabulary and working memory were also explored, and appear to account for some of these findings."

The results showed that, notwithstanding the fact that there were no differences in word decoding, children with ID lagged behind on all predictor measures relevant to early literacy skills compared to children with NLA. Moreover, whereas children with NLA showed a regular predictive pathway of early literacy skills, children with ID showed a deviant pattern, in which nonverbal intelligence and rhythmic skills proved to be of major importance. Also letter knowledge appeared to be involved in their early literacy processing.

Aims: To examine the dimensionality of the construct of school readiness among children with language impairment (LI), as well as the extent to which these dimensions relate to children's end-of-kindergarten literacy skills.

Methods & Procedures: Participants were 136 preschool-aged children with LI. Children were assessed on measures of pre-literacy, social, and behavioural skills in preschool and reading and spelling in kindergarten.

Outcomes & Results: Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that school readiness for this sample of children with LI is best characterized as two dimensions: pre-literacy and socio-emotional. Of the two dimensions, pre-literacy readiness was predictive of children's future performance in reading and spelling.

Conclusions & Implications: The results further our theoretical understanding of the dimensions of school readiness, as well as our knowledge of how these skills are related among children with LI. Identifying domain-specific readiness skills that are predictive of kindergarten success can help to identify means of early assessment and targets for speech‚Äìlanguage intervention."

In many languages a weakness in non-word repetition serves as a useful clinical marker of specific language impairment (SLI) in children. However, recent work in Italian has shown that the repetition of real words may also have clinical utility. For young typically developing Italian children, real word repetition is more predictive of particular grammatical abilities than is non-word repetition. This finding is important because these particular grammatical abilities‚Äîthe production of present-tense third-person plural inflections and direct-object clitic pronouns‚Äîare precisely those that are problematic for Italian-speaking children with SLI. Along with their grammatical requirements, these two morpheme types present a significant phonological/prosodic challenge for these children.



Aims

To replicate the findings with young typically developing Italian children and to determine whether real word repetition is also more predictive of the use of these two morpheme types than is non-word repetition in a group of Italian-speaking children with SLI.



Methods & Procedures

Seventeen Italian-speaking children with SLI and 17 younger typically developing children matched for mean length of utterance participated in tasks of real word and non-word repetition as well as tasks requiring the production of direct-object clitic pronouns and present-tense third-person plural inflections.



Outcomes & Results

Children with SLI were less accurate than their younger peers on all measures. Importantly, for the younger typically developing children, real word repetition explained a significant amount of variance in the use of third-person plural inflections and direct-object clitic pronouns. For the children with SLI, in contrast, non-word repetition was a significant predictor, whereas real word repetition was not a contributing factor.



Conclusions & Implications

It is argued that in Italian SLI, the grammatical details showing the greatest weakness present phonological/prosodic obstacles as well as grammatical challenges to these children. Consequently, non-word repetition emerges as a predictor of these grammatical weaknesses in SLI, unlike the profile observed in typically developing Italian children."

But continuing deficits in spoken language skills have led to challenges in meeting those expectations. This study was conducted to (1) examine two kinds of language skills (phonological and morphosyntactic) at school age (second grade) for children with cochlear implants (CIs); (2) see which measures from earlier in life best predicted performance at second grade; (3) explore how well these skills supported other cognitive and language functions; and (4) examine how treatment factors affected measured outcomes. NA NA NA Methods NA Data were analyzed from 100 second-grade, monolingual English-speaking children: 51 with CIs and 49 with normal hearing (NH). Ten measures of spoken language and related functions were collected: three each of phonological and morphosyntactic skills; and four of other cognitive and language functions. Six measures from preschool and seven from kindergarten served as predictor variables. The effects of treatment variables were examined. NA NA NA Results NA Children with CIs were more delayed acquiring phonological than morphosyntactic skills. Mean length of utterance at earlier ages was the most consistent predictor of both phonological and morphosyntactic skills at second grade.

While behavioral literature has identified core cognitive characteristics of response, the distinction of reading versus executive cognitive contributions to response profiles remains unclear, due in part to the difficulty of segregating these constructs using behavioral outputs. In the current study we used functional neuroimaging to piece apart the mechanisms of how/whether executive and reading network relationships are predictive of intervention response. We found that readers who are responsive to intervention have more typical pre-intervention functional interactions between executive and reading systems compared to nonresponsive readers. These findings suggest that intervention response in dyslexia is influenced not only by domain-specific reading regions, but also by contributions from intervening domain-general networks. Our results make a significant gain in identifying predictive bio-markers of outcomes in dyslexia, and have important implications for the development of personalized clinical interventions."

Spelling accuracy was predicted by word reading (word split) performance, non-word spelling accuracy, keyboard key-finding speed and short-term memory span. Word reading performance predicted accuracy just for words with spelling challenges. For correctly spelled words, RT was predicted by non-word spelling response time and by speed on a key-finding task, and mean IKI by non-verbal cognitive ability, word reading, non-word spelling response time, and key-finding speed. Compared to words with no challenge, mean IKI was shorter for words with an initial challenge and longer for words with a mid-word challenge. These findings suggest that spelling is not fully planned when typing commences, a hypothesis that is confirmed by the fact that IKI immediately before within word challenges were reliably longer than elsewhere within the same word.

Results: Correctness was the best predictor of later spelling by the middle of Year 1, and it significantly outperformed a binary measure of phonological plausibility at the end of Reception Year. Nonbinary measures based on Levenshtein distance were significant predictors of later spelling in the middle of Reception Year and in children who produced no correct spellings.

This study describes a protocol for identifying students at risk for reading difficulty during the kindergarten year. 
Methods: The authors piloted a protocol that included two reading screening instruments, a teacher questionnaire, a parent questionnaire and an oral language screening tool. Kindergarten children in two divergent elementary schools were screened. 
Results: Fifty-nine percent of the children screened demonstrated at least one warning sign warranting follow-up. The authors also found agreement among the results obtained through the various screening tools. Results were provided to first grade teachers the following year so that skill deficits could be addressed. Repeat screening of the children showed gains in skill development for 64% of the children in the follow-up phase.
Conclusion: Children at risk for early reading difficulties can be identified as early as during the kindergarten year. Early identification allows teachers to employ instructional techniques and strategies in an effort to remediate deficits before children demonstrate greater lags in skill development. While early identification is important for all children, it may be an even greater advantage for children entering school with the additional risk factors of social and economic disadvantage."

This paper examines the nature of phonological awareness, letter knowledge, and own name knowledge in a sample of 98 New Zealand children, aged between 3 and 5 years. It examines the development of emergent literacy skills over a 3-month period, with assessments carried out at the start of that time and the end. The nature of the relationships between the emergent literacy skills of phonological awareness, letter name knowledge, and own name knowledge was also examined. A developmental pattern from own name spelling ability to letter knowledge to initial phoneme awareness was found. Support for the lexical restructuring hypothesis was also found..."

Predictors that involve an understanding of quantity, that utilize counting, or that in some way tap ‚Äúnumber sense‚Äù have recently received much attention, although subdivisions within this area are not always clear. In contrast to such number or quantitative predictors, there is also a large body of research that implicates non-quantitative cognitive skills, particularly domain general skills such as working memory, in the expression of math skill (e.g., Bull, Espy, & Wiebe, 2008; Geary, 2004; Swanson, 2006; Swanson, Jerman, & Zheng, 2008). Language and reading skills are also frequently implicated in discussions of math ability and disability in general (Jordan & Hanich, 2003; Jordan, Kaplan, & Hanich, 2002; Geary, 1993; Gersten et al., 2005), with several studies specifically assessing the role of phonological skills or other reading related skills such as rapid naming as predictors of mathematical outcomes (Geary, Hoard, Byrd-Craven, Nugent, & Numtee, 2007; Hecht, Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 2001; Krajewski & Schneider, 2009).

While many studies evaluate the relationships of the above types of precursors to math, there are a much smaller number that evaluate them in a multivariate context, and still fewer that do so in the context of a comprehensive model. Thus, little is known about how these sets of precursors relate to one another, which has implications for the extent to which they may have unique contributions to math performance. Recently, however, LeFevre and colleagues (LeFevre, Fast, Skwarchuck, Smith-Chant, Bisanz et al., in press) have proposed a model (the ‚Äúpathways‚Äù model) relating the three types of precursors described above to mathematical achievement, and this serves as a framework for the present study. The current study contributes to existing research by: (a) evaluating the three pathways of LeFevre et al. (in press) at the level of latent rather than observed variables; (b) assessing the quantity domain comprehensively and distinguishing between core and mediating precursors therein; (c) establishing the relationship of these latent variables to a measure of small sums addition; and (d) examining performance in a relatively large and diverse sample at the kindergarten level, after students have been exposed to a formal learning environment, but have not yet completed development of their procedural arithmetic skills. Understanding what predicts early mathematical performance is crucial given the importance of these skills for more complex mathematical skill many years later (Duncan et al., 2007)."

NA Study design NA Participants were drawn from a longitudinal, community cohort. Assessment at age 4 years (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ1494) identified children with speech errors. Reassessment at age 7 years allowed categorization into resolved or persistent categories. Logistic regression examined predictors of speech outcome, including family history, sex, socioeconomic status, nonverbal intelligence, and speech error type (delay vs disorder). NA Results NA At age 7 years, persistent errors were seen in over 40% of children who had errors at age 4 years. Speech symptomatology was the only significant predictor of outcome ( P ‚Äâ=‚Äâ.02). Children with disordered errors at age 4 years were twice as likely to have poor speech outcomes at age 7 years compared with those with delayed errors. NA Conclusions NA Children with speech delay at age 4 years seem more likely to resolve, and this might justify a ""watch and wait"" approach.

During kindergarten, they were tested with an oral story production task and in first grade with a written story production task. Narratives were evaluated in terms of structure, cohesion and consistency. In the first grade, children were also submitted to a dictation task to evaluate their spelling competence. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed in order to examine narrative competence development, also considering gender differences, and regression analyses were implemented to evaluate the predictive capability of textual abilities expressed by oral narratives on textual abilities expressed by writing. The results showed some significant differences when scores in kindergarten were compared to scores in primary school. Moreover, the ability to tell well-structured, cohesive and consistent stories predicts the ability to write stories with the same qualities in the sample of participants without spelling difficulty. Instead, the predictive link is not apparent considering those children with difficulties in orthographic ability. This research allows us to reflect about how the medium of writing might interfere, on the basis of the level of mastery, with the opportunity to express narrative skills in the transition from the oral to written code. The central role of writing instrument functionality opens the way to practical implications."

At the end of Grade 1, the effect sizes in favor of Exp were .14 and .22 in word reading and spelling. In Study 2 with educational interventions (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ2803), children in Exp benefit from an evidence-based practice, i.e. a code-focused intervention (phonology, letter knowledge, decoding and fluency) developed by the Association Agir pour l'Ecole (Act for School) and conducted by teachers in small groups for children with low performance at the beginning of Grade 1. The effect sizes of interventions in various literacy skills were from .12 to .32. This set of results obtained in France is in accordance with those described in other countries. To conclude, a double intervention with small classes and targeted educational approaches could be one of the best ways of reducing inequalities during learning to read."

Reading achievement was subsequently assessed at the end of Kindergarten and Grade 1. The strongest predictors of reading achievement were tasks tapping phonological processing skills, interdigital dexterity, and familiarity with the alphabetic code of English script. Collectively, individual attributes accounted for 63% of the variance in reading achievement at the end of Kindergarten and 59% at the end of Grade 1. A short set of five predictors offers a potentially useful screening test for the early identification of reading-disabled children. The effect of the ability composition of a child's class and school was also assessed. Significant ability-composition effects were obtained, accounting for 9% of Kindergarten and 6% of Grade 1 reading achievement variance over and above variance owing to individual factors. Peer ability was as strong a predictor of individual reading achievement as individual ability. Children emerging from primary school exhibit enormous variation in their reading achievement. Within a single school it is possible to find children who are reading at several grades above their own grade level, while other children at the same school are reading at several grades below. Furthermore, there are often substantial differences in reading achievement between schools. The source of this enormous variation in achievement has been the focus of considerable research in the last two decades. Both in-school factors, such as school and teacher characteristics, and out-of-school factors, such as individual pupil abilities and family background, have been investigated.

Students' activities in 20 classrooms were observed, confirming that half of the classrooms followed an individualized language-experience approach and half a decoding-oriented basal reader approach. Year-end testing of the students revealed basic level reading skill to be less universally acquired in the language-experience group, but no difference in information processing and linguistic abilities between the two groups. In addition, while the various cognitive measures generally correlated positively with reading in the decoding-oriented group, significant negative correlations between linguistic ability and reading skill were observed in the language-experience group. It is argued that linguistic ability facilitates beginning reading only after a threshold of print-specific skills is acquired, and that the observed difference between the two groups stemmed primarily from their varying emphasis on systematic instruction, with corrective feedback, of these print-specific skills."

However, recent evidence has been equivocal with data suggesting problems in the spectral domain. The present study examined event-related potential (ERP) measures of auditory sensory temporal and spectral processing, and their interaction, in typical children and those with LI (7‚Äì17 years; n=25 per group). The stimuli were 3 CV syllables and 3 consonant-to-vowel transitions (spectral sweeps) isolated from the syllables. Each of these 6 stimuli appeared in 3 durations (transitions: 20, 50, and 80 ms; syllables: 120, 150, and 180 ms). Behaviorally, the group with LIs showed inferior syllable discrimination both with long and short stimuli. In ERPs, trends were observed in the group with LI for diminished long-latency negativities (the N2-N4 peaks) and a developmentally transient enhancement of the P2 peak. Some, but not all, ERP indices of spectral processing also showed trends to be diminished in the group with LI specifically in responses to syllables. Importantly, measures of the transition N2-N4 peaks correlated with expressive language abilities in the LI children. None of the group differences depended on stimulus duration. Therefore, sound brevity did not account for the diminished spectral resolution in these LI children. Rather, the results suggest a deficit in acoustic feature integration at higher levels of auditory sensory processing. The observed maturational trajectory suggests a non-linear developmental deviance rather than simple delay."

The study was conducted over a 2-year period, using a population of 70 children. Data were collected from inclusive classrooms in a child development center and self-contained classrooms in the public schools. Measures included the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised (WJ-R) and the Early Literacy Checklist. Activities designed to fac;litate skills in print awareness, metalinguistic awareness, and oral language were implemented over a 6-month period with the three preschool populations. Both the children with disabilities and the children at-risk made significant gains on standardized and criterion-referenced measures of language, early literacy, and metalinguistic awareness.

Cook, Doctor of Philosophy Utah State University, 2010 Major Professor: Dr. Lori A. Roggman Department: Family, Consumer, and Human Development Reading success has been linked to high school completion, future job success, and future generations of children who can read. Unfortunately, children who are unable to read on grade level by the end of first grade are at a great disadvantage and unlikely to catch up later. Without the ability to read and comprehend text, all aspects of schooling become progressively more difficult and the challenge of poor reading ability can be so difficult to overcome that many poor readers will not complete high school. For these reasons, it is important to identify early experiences in a child‚Äôs family environment that predict the early skills that are necessary for later reading and reading comprehension. The child‚Äôs family environment includes the quality of both the general home setting and specific kinds of parent-child interactions. The skills necessary for reading success include vocabulary, phonological skills, and other early literacy skills, but broader cognitive and regulatory skills may also be necessary."

Comparisons focused on language samples and formalized vocabulary assessments gathered from 28 twins and 28 singletons within the Western Reserve Reading Project; the two groups were matched on age, gender, and parent education level. The children‚Äôs language samples, taken from conversational interactions, were analyzed for mean length of utterance, number of different words, number of total words, and total number of conjunctions, all of which were converted to z-scores and averaged to form a Conversational Composite. Similarly, children‚Äôs scores on the Stanford Binet Vocabulary subtest (Thorndike, Hagen, & Sattler, 1986) and the Boston Naming Test (Goodglass & Kaplan, 2001) were converted into a Formal Language Composite. Mean comparisons via t-test revealed no group differences between twins and on either of the composites. In addition to the Conversational and Formal Composites, a pilot coding process for topic initiation and management was completed for 3 twin-sibling pairs, or a total of 6 children. The topics of modeling clay, school, and hobbies emerged as the most common across transcripts. Measures related to topic management revealed consistent overlap between the two groups. Examiners, in comparison to children, initiated twice as many topic shifts. In sum, results suggest that twinship in and of itself does not indicate a substantial risk for school-age expressive language difficulties, and provide early descriptive data to analyze the transactional nature of topic management within conversational interactions."

The first group comprised the oldest children of a sample of kindergarten children. The second and third groups comprised the youngest and oldest children from a first-grade sample. The kindergarten group was equivalent to the younger first-grade group in terms of general verbal maturity, but had not been exposed to reading instruction.

On all tasks, both first-grade groups performed at equivalent levels, and both groups did better than the kindergarten group. In all groups, onset and rime unity oddity tasks were of equal difficulty, but phoneme oddity tasks were more difficult than rime oddity tasks.

The findings suggested that most tasks of Phonological Awareness and RAN were highly correlated to basic reading skills in Spanish-speaking ELLs and that these measures should be part of a dyslexia assessment with this population.

factors, for example, the status of each language (majority, minority), which language is used in the school, and whether children
are acquiring literacy in one or both languages. Their language ability depends to a large extent on the use of each language and
on whether they each language at the same rate. The aim of the study was to investigate how primary school bilingual children in
the UK perform on several domains of language and reading skills and how these relate to language dominance. Moreover, it
addressed how this performance is affected by a range of contextual factors and whether there are cross-language relationships
in the children‚Äôs language and reading abilities. Forty Greek-English bilingual children in Year 1 and Year 3 were tested on
vocabulary, phonological awareness, morphological awareness, morpho-syntax, and decoding in Greek and English. The results
showed that as a group, the children were Greek dominant before the age of 4 but English dominant now and confirm that
language dominance could change even before children enter school and affects language and literacy skills equally. A strong
relationship between language use and performance was only in evidence in the minority language, which suggests that parental
effort should be directed towards the minority language because schooling appears to level out differences in the majority
language. There was no negative relationship between the use of the heritage language and children‚Äôs language and reading
performance in the majority language. In contrast, significant positive cross-language associations were revealed among
vocabulary, phonological awareness, inflectional morphology and decoding skills. The practical implications of this study are that
parents and teachers should be informed for the positive effects of heritage language use in and outside the home for the
maintenance of the heritage language and for the development of the children‚Äôs language and literacy skills."

Children were assessed for emergent literacy at the beginning of first grade, and were identified as having reading difficulties at the end of second grade if they performed below the national threshold in at least three of the subtests in reading and spelling. The multifactorial model suggested that children with family risk showed reading difficulties that could not be explained in terms of individual differences in emergent literacy, gender, interest in literacy, years in kindergarten, home literacy environment or parental education level. These findings highlight the advantages of using multifactorial models of reading difficulties that encompass different domains of genetic, cognitive-based and environmental factors. In sum, not only did we find family risk is associated with children‚Äôs literacy outcomes after 2¬†years of formal reading instruction, but we also identified possible modifiable factors that may benefit from interventions and lessen the likelihood of developing reading difficulties."

In decontextualized treatment activities, children practiced saying the letter names and sounds that matched single letters presented on cards and in letter books, and speeded recognition of taught letters. In contextualized treatment activities, letter names and sounds were taught and practiced during oral reading of storybooks, recognizing letters in children's printed names, and speeded recognition of taught letters in words. Subjects were 127 preschool children, including 48 dual-language learners, in five public schools with low-income eligibility thresholds. Children were randomly assigned within classrooms to small groups randomly assigned to one of the two treatments.

Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design and measurements across a period of two years, we tested the effects of two interventions: a consecutive combination of a musical and a phonological training and a phonological training alone. The design made it possible to disentangle effects of the musical training alone as well the effects of its combination with the phonological training. The outcome measures of these groups were compared with the control group with multivariate analyses, controlling for a number of background variables. The sample included N = 424 German-speaking children aged 4 to 5 years at the beginning of the study. We found a positive relationship between musical abilities and phonological awareness. Yet, whereas the well-established phonological training produced the expected effects, adding a musical training did not contribute significantly to phonological awareness development. Training effects were partly dependent on the initial level of phonological awareness. Possible reasons for the lack of training effects in the musical part of the combination condition as well as practical implications for early literacy education are discussed."

The relationship between phonological awareness (PA) and early reading achievement has been clearly established for the general population (e.g., see reviews by Adams, 1990; Blachman, 1994; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987). It is also been well-documented that children with language impairments have delays in phonological awareness abilities (e.g., Bird, Bishop, & Freeman, 1995; Bishop & Adams, 1990; Catts, 1993; Kamhi & Catts, 1986; Kamhi, Lee, & Nelson, 1985; Menyuk & Chesnick, 1997), and intervention studies have shown that we can successfully foster PA skills in preschoolers and kindergartners with both speech and language impairments (e.g., Gillon, 2000, 2002; Laing & Espeland, 2005; Segers & Verhoeven, 2004; van Kleeck, Gillam, & McFadden, 1998). Phonological awareness, however, is only one of the phonological processing skills known to be important to early decoding. In addition to PA, the contributions of phonological working memory (WM) to early decoding (word attack skill in early reading) have been well established for children who are typically developing, children with reading disorders, and children with language impairments (see Catts & Kamhi, 1999; Goswami & Bryant, 1990; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987 for reviews). Phonological WM has been measured by both word and nonword repetition and span tasks. Of these two kinds of measures, nonword recall tasks are believed to more ""purely"" reflect phonological working memory, since they must be carried out independent of semantic lexical knowledge (Gathercole, in press; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990; Henry & Millar, 1991). Studies outside of the area of reading corroborate that children with language impairment perform more poorly than age- and language-matched peers on nonword repetition and nonword span tasks, suggesting that these children have a diminished phonological WM capacity (e.g., Bishop, North, & Donlan, 1996; Dollaghan & Campbell, 1998; Edwards & Lahey, 1998; Ellis Weismer, Tomblin, Zhang, Buckwalter, Chynoweth, & Jones, 2000; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990; Gillam, Cowan, & Day, 1995; Gray, 2003, 2004; Marton & Schwartz, 2003; Montgomery, 1995, 2000a, 2000b). As we continue to work to develop interventions that take empirical findings regarding the basic cognitive underpinnings of early decoding into account, these findings might lead us to ask if we should be targeting phonological WM in addition to PA in order to provide the best possible foundation for later early decoding skills in children with language impairments. First, however, we might ask if it is feasible to directly improve phonological WM skills. We know that nonword recall is highly heritable (Bishop et al., 1996) and that it is not readily affected by environmental influences (Alloway, Gathercole, Willis, & Adams, 2004; Campbell, Dollaghan, Needleman, & Janosky, 1997). One possible consequence of these facts is that the phonological memory skills underlying nonword recall may be resistant to treatment (Gathercole, in press). We are aware of only one study that has trained children in nonword repetition in order to improve phonological WM, and hence early reading ability. The study involved 120 Greek-speaking kindergartners who were assigned randomly to a control or treatment group (Maridaki-Kassotaki, 2002). The treatment lasted for the school year, and the treatment group showed superior performance over the control group on a reading test at the end of first grade. This was only one study, and it was not conducted with children learning the English script. ‚Ä¶"

These two broad skills explained separate parts of the variance on both outcome measures, while revealing opposite effects: phonological skills explained more variance for alphabetic reading skills and oral comprehension explained more variance for reading comprehension. We also assessed the effects of two preschool training programmes focusing on either phonological awareness or comprehension skills.

Participants were drawn from the Florida Twin Project on Reading, with a total of 2370 pairs of twins‚Äô representative of the state of Florida. Twins‚Äô oral reading fluency scores from school progress monitoring records collected in the fall of grades 1 through 5 were used to model development. Results suggested that genetic influences on the development of reading are general, shared across the early school years, as well as novel, with new genetic influences introduced at each of the first three years of school. The shared environment estimates suggest a pattern of general influences only, suggesting environmental effects which are moderate and stable across development."

Dyslexia is associated with structural and functional alterations in various brain regions that support reading. Neuroimaging studies in infants and pre-reading children suggest that these alterations predate reading instruction and reading failure, supporting the hypothesis that variant function in dyslexia susceptibility genes lead to atypical neural migration and/or axonal growth during early, most likely in utero, brain development. Yet, dyslexia is typically not diagnosed until a child has failed to learn to read as expected (usually in second grade or later). There is emerging evidence that neuroimaging measures, when combined with key behavioral measures, can enhance the accuracy of identification of dyslexia risk in pre-reading children but its sensitivity, specificity, and cost-efficiency is still unclear. Early identification of dyslexia risk carries important implications for dyslexia remediation and the amelioration of the psychosocial consequences commonly associated with reading failure.

Further, rate of growth in early number competence predicted mathematics performance level in 3rd grade. Although low-income children performed more poorly than their middle-income counterparts in mathematics achievement and progressed at a slower rate, their performance and growth were mediated through relatively weak kindergarten number competence.

Two research questions guided this work: (1) Do Spanish-speaking English language learners receiving ESL services in the fall of kindergarten demonstrate homogeneous early literacy skills, or are there distinct patterns of achievement across measures of phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, and orthography? and (2) if there are distinct profiles, to what extent do they predict literacy achievement at the end of kindergarten and the beginning of first grade? Using cluster analysis, the authors identified four distinct literacy profiles derived from fall kindergarten measures of phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, and phonetic spelling. These profiles were found to be associated with literacy outcomes in spring of kindergarten and fall of first grade. The two profiles that were associated with greater success on later measures of concept of word in text, letter sound knowledge, word reading, and spelling were the two that included stronger performance on orthographic skills (i.e., alphabet knowledge and phonetic spelling). These findings demonstrated that there is heterogeneity among Hispanic ESL students at kindergarten entry and suggested that literacy instruction must be differentiated from the very beginning in order to meet students‚Äô individual needs.

This study considers the role of early speech difficulties in literacy development, in the context of additional risk factors.

Method
Children were identified with speech sound disorder (SSD) at the age of 3¬Ω¬†years, on the basis of performance on the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology. Their literacy skills were assessed at the start of formal reading instruction (age 5¬Ω), using measures of phoneme awareness, word-level reading and spelling; and 3¬†years later (age 8), using measures of word-level reading, spelling and reading comprehension.

Results
The presence of early SSD conferred a small but significant risk of poor phonemic skills and spelling at the age of 5¬Ω and of poor word reading at the age of 8. Furthermore, within the group with SSD, the persistence of speech difficulties to the point of school entry was associated with poorer emergent literacy skills, and children with ‚Äòdisordered‚Äô speech errors had poorer word reading skills than children whose speech errors indicated ‚Äòdelay‚Äô. In contrast, the initial severity of SSD was not a significant predictor of reading development. Beyond the domain of speech, the presence of a co-occurring language impairment was strongly predictive of literacy skills and having a family risk of dyslexia predicted additional variance in literacy at both time-points.

Conclusions
Early SSD alone has only modest effects on literacy development but when additional risk factors are present, these can have serious negative consequences, consistent with the view that multiple risks accumulate to predict reading disorders."

Speech skills were assessed in a large ( N ‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ569) unselected sample of 5-year old children just after school entry. Children also completed a wide range of tasks measuring oral language (expressive vocabulary, receptive grammar and listening comprehension), reading and reading-related skills (single word reading, letter-sound knowledge, phoneme awareness, rapid automatized naming) and non-verbal IQ. Assessments were repeated six months later. Speech difficulties were identified in 6.88% of children. Speech difficulties were associated with poorer non-verbal IQ, oral language and reading relative to children without speech difficulties. A mediation model demonstrated that the relationship between speech difficulties and later reading was entirely mediated by phoneme awareness. Speech difficulties at school entry are related to problems in acquiring phoneme awareness which in turn are associated with problems in learning to read. Clinically, our results imply that any child who has a speech difficulty at school entry should be assessed and monitored for broader oral language difficulties and for delays in reading development with a view to providing early intervention to ameliorate such difficulties."

Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.Background: Reading comprehension draws on both decoding and linguistic comprehension, and poor reading comprehension can be the consequence of a deficit in either of these skills. Methods: Using outcome data from the longitudinal Wellcome Language and Reading Project, we identified three groups of children at age 8 years: children with dyslexia (N = 21) who had deficits in decoding but not oral language, children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD; N = 38) whose decoding skills were in the normal range, and children who met criteria for both dyslexia and DLD (N = 29). Results: All three groups had reading comprehension difficulties at the ages of 8 and 9 years relative to TD controls though those of the children with dyslexia were mild (relative to TD controls, d = 0.51 at age 8, d = 0.60 at age 8); while the most severe problems were found in the comorbid dyslexia + DLD group (d = 1.79 at age 8, d = 2.06 at age 9) those with DLD also had significant difficulties (d = 1.56 at age 8, d = 1.56 at age 9). Conclusions: These findings confirm that children with dyslexia or DLD are at-risk for reading comprehension difficulties but for different reasons, because of weak decoding in the case of dyslexia or weak oral language skills in the case of DLD. Different forms of intervention are required for these groups of children, targeted to their particular area(s) of weakness."

One year later when twins in all three samples had received formal literacy instruction for at least one full school year, heritability was similarly high across country, with estimated genetic influences varying between .79 and .83 for reading and between .62 and .79 for spelling.

Oral language skills are a critical foundation for literacy and more generally for educational success. The current study shows that oral language skills can be improved by providing suitable additional help to children with language difficulties in the early stages of formal education.

Methods
We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 394 children in England, comparing a 30-week oral language intervention programme starting in nursery (N¬†=¬†132) with a 20-week version of the same programme starting in Reception (N¬†=¬†133). The intervention groups were compared to an untreated waiting control group (N¬†=¬†129). The programmes were delivered by trained teaching assistants (TAs) working in the children's schools/nurseries. All testers were blind to group allocation.

Results
Both the 20- and 30-week programmes produced improvements on primary outcome measures of oral language skill compared to the untreated control group. Effect sizes were small to moderate (20-week programme: d¬†=¬†.21; 30-week programme: d¬†=¬†.30) immediately following the intervention and were maintained at follow-up 6¬†months later. The difference in improvement between the 20-week and 30-week programmes was not statistically significant. Neither programme produced statistically significant improvements in children's early word reading or reading comprehension skills (secondary outcome measures).

Conclusions
This study provides further evidence that oral language interventions can be delivered successfully by trained TAs to children with oral language difficulties in nursery and Reception classes. The methods evaluated have potentially important policy implications for early education."

Most studies examining the genetic basis of RAN and RAS have focused on pedigree-based analyses in samples of European descent, with limited representation of groups with Hispanic or African ancestry. In the present study, we conducted a multivariate genome-wide association analysis to identify shared genetic factors that contribute to performance across RAN Objects, RAN Letters, and RAS Letters/Numbers in a sample of Hispanic and African American youth. We then tested whether they also contribute to variance in reading fluency and word reading. Genome-wide significant, pleiotropic, effects across RAN Objects, RAN Letters, and RAS Letters/Numbers were observed for SNPs located on chromosome 10q23.31, which also showed significant association with reading fluency and word reading performance. Bioinformatic analysis of this region using extant epigenetic data from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium indicates functionality in the brain. Neuroimaging genetic analysis showed that rs1555839, the top associated SNP, was also associated with cortical volume in the right inferior parietal cortex, a region of the brain that processes numerical information and that is activated in reading disabled individuals performing reading tasks. This study provides support for a novel locus on chromosome 10q23.31 associated with RAN, RAS, and reading-related performance."

These children were classified as at risk or not using each method across three early-literacy skills (i.e., language, phonological awareness, print knowledge) and at three levels of severity (i.e., 5th, 10th, 25th percentiles). Chance-corrected affected-status agreement (CCASA) indicated poor agreement among methods with rates of agreement generally decreasing with greater levels of severity for both single- and two-measure classification, and agreement rates were lower for two-measure classification than for single-measure classification. These low rates of agreement between conventional methods of identifying children at risk for LD represent a significant impediment for identification and intervention for young children considered at-risk."

Our results show an increase in performance at each phonological processing step, but also suggest a qualitative evolution in their relative importance. Hierarchical regression analyses indicate that reading skills are mainly predicted by phonological awareness measured at the kindergarten stage and, subsequently, by phonological memory abilities measured at the end of first grade.

One of the procedures is implementation of direct instruction in instruction of phonemic awareness. Current study is one of the unique studies in Iran that investigate impact of direct instruction in phonemic awareness on reading achievement of students with reading disorder. Case: Three male second grade elementary students with reading disorder in a regular school in district six of the office of education in Tehran were selected. Multiple-baseline across subjects was selected as a research design. The following tests were used as diagnostic criteria: reading and dyslexia test and Wechsler intelligence scale for children-revised. Moreover, a reading inventory consisting of 100 words was developed by researchers to assess the reading ability of the subjects. Data were collected in three phases: baseline, intervention, and follow-up. During the intervention phase, the intervention strategies were used while during baseline and follow-up, data were collected without any intervention. Comparing three phases of the study, we may conclude that intervention package consisting of direct instruction of phonological awareness was an effective strategy in reading achievement of all three students. In addition, follow-up data indicated that the effects of the intervention procedures were stable across time. Conclusion: Direct instruction of phonological awareness was effective in reading achievement of students with reading disorder in elementary school and increasing their abilities in reading."

The results show that letter-name knowledge had a large impact on letter-sound acquisition. Phonological awareness had a larger effect on letter-sound knowledge when letter names were known than when letter names were unknown. Furthermore, students were more likely to know the sounds of consonant-vowel letters (e.g., b and d) than vowel-consonant letters (e.g., l and m) and letters with no sound cues (e.g., h and y) when the letter name was known and phonological awareness was accounted for.

Reading is a complex task involving perceptual, motor, linguistic, phonological, and memory components, each of which has a crucial role in determining reading rate. High poverty rates continue to have a negative impact on human resource development and education quality in Africa, further complicating the ability of most countries to reach the Education for All (EFA) and Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Moreover, Africa and Asia are hosts to most of the world's multilingual countries, in which textbook availability in major indigenous languages is sorely lacking. Therefore, it is important to take all possible steps to maximize the effectiveness of teaching interventions. In parallel, also the quality of textbooks is a crucial factor for quality education, especially in developing countries. It is important to dispose of well-written and well-designed textbooks, because the quality of textbook can be an important predictor of student learning and can contribute to the effective use of instructional time and classroom teaching. This review examines the evidence regarding variables influencing acquisition of decoding and comprehension reading skills. One important caveat is in order. While the educational, psychological and neuroscience literature on reading is extensive, it largely depends upon studies on English speaking individuals. The first part of the review focuses on studies of visual psychophysics and examines the visual limitations affecting reading and its development. The second part of the review draws on the psychological and neuroscience literature to examine the role of several variables influencing reading acquisition, such as letter knowledge, teaching method, teacher's competence, orthographic consistency."

A special challenge for the application of the language-rich curriculum and professional development package implemented in this study was the presence of a large proportion of ELL children in essentially English-speaking classrooms. We, therefore, sought to determine whether the program was effective for improving English language and literacy outcomes for English-language learners as well as native English speakers. There were large and significant differences between treatment and control groups on literacy outcomes for all students. On the literacy tasks, ELL students in the treatment groups performed nearly as well or better than non-ELL students at the beginning of kindergarten, and reached national norms on standardized tests. There were also significant program impacts on some language outcomes for all students. ELL students who received the intervention significantly outperformed ELL students in the control groups on English receptive and expressive vocabulary. On the more complex oral comprehension skills, preschool did not have a significant impact for ELL students. Intervention effects on receptive vocabulary and oral comprehension for native speakers were found only for the third cohort and were not found for expressive vocabulary. These results provide evidence that, given material supports, coaching, professional development, and the use of a language and literacy-focused curriculum, prekindergarten classrooms can enable low-SES children from diverse language backgrounds to enter kindergarten with literacy skills at or near national norms and can significantly impact some language skills. While non-native speakers of English continued to score lower on language measures than their native-speaking peers, results show that 1 year of preschool can put all children on a positive trajectory for long-term success in school."
